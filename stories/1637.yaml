text: "Indefatigable paperbackist Pebblehead has yet another new book out this week.\
  \ Planet Of The Cloth-Eared Bears is a sci-fi potboiler featuring heroic spaceman\
  \ Captain Biffo Melvynbragg.\nThe story begins with the captain's spaceship forced\
  \ to crashland on a remote planet, populated entirely by bears who are hard of hearing.\
  \ Scorched beyond repair, the spaceship's engines attract the attention of some\
  \ of the bears, who communicate with each other by a complex system of paw manipulation.\
  \ Captain Biffo, who has among his accomplishments a diploma in earth-bear behavioural\
  \ studies, is beflummoxed when he realises he cannot fathom the space-bears\u2019\
  \ lingua franca.\nUsing his space-spade, the captain digs a pit in the spectacularly\
  \ gruesome soil of the planet's surface, hoping to trap at least one of the bears\
  \ in it. But these are wily space-bears, and they wait for the captain to finish\
  \ digging his pit before dissolving his space-spade using their exciting rayguns.\
  \ Then they push Biffo himself into the pit.\nForty pages of the paperback are then\
  \ taken up with the captain's musings about his predicament, which include passages\
  \ of blatant plagiarism from writers such as W N P Barbellion, Stefan Zweig, Sylvia\
  \ Townsend Warner, and Prudence Foxglove. Pebblehead has either forgotten about\
  \ the rest of the spaceship's crew or wishes us to believe that Captain Biffo was\
  \ flying a solo mission. The latter is highly unlikely, given the nature of interplanetary\
  \ protocols at the time, described carefully and at length in a prolegomenon, the\
  \ sort of thing Pebblehead can dash off as breezily as the rest of us would write\
  \ a shopping list, if we still had shops to go to, in this wasteland.\nEventually,\
  \ the cloth-eared space-bears haul Captain Biffo out of the pit with a winch, and\
  \ subject him to a personality profile questionnaire. This is given in multiple\
  \ choice format, which allows Pebblehead to play around, quite foolishly, with the\
  \ conventions of multiple choice personality profile questionnaires. It transpires\
  \ that Biffo is a \u201Cdrugged-up chaffinch\u201D type, the most dangerous personality\
  \ profile as far as the space-bears are concerned. They put Biffo back in the pit\
  \ and hold a bear-moot. Pebblehead has great fun with this, probably more so than\
  \ his readers.\nAt the end of the moot, half of the planet's suns explode, for no\
  \ apparent reason. Biffo exploits the resulting mayhem and confusion to clamber\
  \ out of the pit and to sprint towards his hobbled spaceship. Just before he gets\
  \ there, a cloth-eared space-bear zaps him with a different type of exciting raygun.\
  \ Biffo does not dissolve, but instead is himself transformed into one of the space-bears.\
  \ Somehow, his hearing is not impaired by this metamorphosis, and he becomes a valued\
  \ member of the community, even though he never quite masters the paw manipulation\
  \ technique.\nIn the final pages, Pebblehead describes with exquisite dullness the\
  \ slow rusting and disintegration of the spaceship, over many planet-years, until\
  \ not a trace of it remains. And then, just as we are thinking what a waste of time\
  \ the whole book has been, Captain Biffo, or rather the space-bear he has become,\
  \ goes into a kind of spasmodic fit, sheds his space-bear characteristics in a form\
  \ of ecdysis, knocks together a brand new spaceship out of space-cardboard boxes\
  \ and space-twigs and space-gum, weirdly transmogrifies the planet's atmosphere\
  \ so the space-bears can hear properly, and blasts off into the boundless firmament,\
  \ heading for his next adventure.\nWord has it that Pebblehead has already written\
  \ three-quarters of the sequel, but he is keeping under his hat whether it will\
  \ be about Captain Biffo or about the no longer cloth-eared bears. If you want to\
  \ know more about Pebblehead's hat, and what else he keeps under it, you will soon\
  \ be able to register for a newsletter, in paper form, delivered to your door by\
  \ the postie once in a blue moon, or when the cows come home.\n[2009-02-04]"
