text: "In cities, do social meetings abound? and what are their purposes and character?\
  \ Are they most religious, political, or festive? If religious, have they more the\
  \ character of Passion Week at Rome, or of a camp-meeting in Ohio? If political,\
  \ do the people meet on wide plains to worship the Sun of the Celestial Empire,\
  \ as in China; or in town-halls, to remonstrate with their representatives, as in\
  \ England; or in secret places, to spring mines under the thrones of their rulers,\
  \ as in Spain? If festive, are they most like an Italian carnival, where everybody\
  \ laughs; or an Egyptian holiday, when all eyes are solemnly fixed on the whirling\
  \ Dervishes? Are women there? In what proportions, and under what law of liberty?\
  \ What are the public amusements?\u2026In country towns, how is the imitation of\
  \ the metropolis carried on? Do the provincials emulate most in show, in science,\
  \ or in the fine arts? In the villages, w hat are the popular amusements? Do the\
  \ people meet to drink or to read, to discuss, or play games, or dance? What are\
  \ the public houses like? Do the people eat fruit and tell stories? or drink ale\
  \ and talk politics or call for tea and saunter about? or coffee and play dominoes?\
  \ or lemonade and laugh at Punch? Do they crowd within four walls, or gather under\
  \ the elm, or spread themselves abroad over the cricket-field or the yellow sands?\u2026\
  \ In the manners of all classes, from the highest to the lowest, are forms of manners\
  \ enforced in action, or dismissed in words? Is there barbarous freedom in the lower,\
  \ while there is formality in the higher ranks, as in newly settled countries? or\
  \ have all grown up together to that period of refined civilization when ease has\
  \ superseded alike the freedom of the Australian peasantry, and the etiquette of\
  \ the court of Ava? What are the manners of professional men of the society, from\
  \ the eminent lawyer or physician of the metropolis down to the village barber?\n\
