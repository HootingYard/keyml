text: "Another thing I learned from Koba The Dread was that Stalin, for a time, backed\
  \ the theories of the linguist Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr (1865\u20131934). One of\
  \ Marr's more amusing beliefs was that all words derive ultimately from the root\
  \ sounds rosh, sal, ber and yon. (\u201CLinguisticians who held otherwise\u201D\
  , Amis tells us, \u201Cwere jailed or shot.\u201D)\nDobson came across Marr's work\
  \ at some point, and as a result produced what must be, by any measure, his most\
  \ preposterous essay. In The FA Cup Final Of 1962 As It Might Have Been Reported\
  \ By One Of Our Troglodyte Ancestors, the out of print pamphleteer \u201Cchannels\u201D\
  \ the caveman mindset, as he sees it, and constructs a forty-four page text of blithering\
  \ inanity. A (mercifully) brief extract will suffice:\nBer. Sal-ber. Yon yon yon.\
  \ Rosh ber sal ber yon rosh ber. Ber. Sal rosh rosh, rosh. Yon. Yon sal rosh ber\
  \ sal ber yon sal yon ber rosh rosh ber ber ber ber ber ber rosh yon. Sal.\nAnd\
  \ so it goes on. Unaccountably, this drivel scooped up no fewer than five prizes\
  \ during 1963 and 1964, including the Prix Des Brochures Incroyable and the Pearl\
  \ Carr And Teddy Johnson Glistening Golden Medal For Pamphlets Out Of Print Within\
  \ Days Of Publication.\n\nN Marr\n[2009-12-22]"
