text: "It is almost impossible to read a memoir or biography of a Victorian writer\
  \ without coming upon the inevitable walking statistics. Even [John Stuart] Mill,\
  \ that effeminate \u201Clogic-chopping machine\u201D\u2026 walked fifteen miles\
  \ three days before his death at the age of sixty-seven, a modest record compared\
  \ with [Leslie] Stephen's grandfather, who celebrated his seventieth birthday by\
  \ walking twenty-five miles to breakfast, then to his office, and home again the\
  \ same day. Fifty miles a day was about the average for the \u201CSunday Tramps\u201D\
  \ organised by Stephen.\nGertrude Himmelfarb, Victorian Minds (Weidenfeld & Nicolson\
