text: "Between the years 1787 and 1804, in the ethereal realms, the dead Gluck and\
  \ the unborn Glinka became friends and allies. They were drawn together by mutual\
  \ puzzlement at the absence, from those very realms, of Buxtehude, who had been\
  \ dead since 1707 and ought, therefore, to have put in an appearance in the mystic\
  \ aether. Gluck and Glinka, or their spirit-essences, set out to track down Buxtehude,\
  \ or his immortal soul, a quest which only came to an end when Glinka was transformed\
  \ into a material mewling infant in 1804. Gluck had to drum his heels and await\
  \ Glinka's return to the ethereal realms in 1857. By this time, of course, Buxtehude's\
  \ immortal soul had been missing for a full one hundred and fifty years, which is\
  \ as close as dammit to a cut-off point in the world of spirits.\nThis is the conceit\
  \ of an unfinished novel by Algernon Spooky, the so-called \u201Cpsychic windowcleaner\u201D\
  \ who has a walk-on part in virtually every single biography and memoir of the first\
  \ half of the twentieth century. Spooky seems to have known everybody, and frequently\
  \ got into fist-fights with them. He was a commanding figure, described by Pipton\
  \ as resembling a cross between a Roman emperor and a harrier hawk, with a bit of\
  \ the temple of Angkor Wat thrown in. Unfortunately for the fate of his novel, Algernon\
  \ Spooky had a tin ear and knew nothing of music, so his attempts to bring the souls\
  \ of Gluck and Glinka and Buxtehude to fictional life are, in the words of Pipton\
  \ again, \u201Clike watching an idiot child drool into a tin cup\u201D.\nAfter scribbling\
  \ thousands and thousands of words, Spooky realised he was making a fool of himself\u2014\
  not for the first time\u2014and tried to rework the material into a detective thriller.\
  \ Here, Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude became a trio of malefactors plotting dark\
  \ and dismal deeds. They hid in plain sight, operating from a high-street shoe shop\
  \ clearly modelled on Freeman, Hardy and Willis. Only when Freeman, or Hardy, or\
  \ Willis, or Freeman and Hardy, or Hardy and Willis, or Freeman and Willis, or for\
  \ Christ's sake let us have done with it, all three of them, got wind of Spooky's\
  \ tale and threatened him with a libel suit did that manuscript, too, end up in\
  \ the dustbin.\nBut being Algernon Spooky, it was no ordinary dustbin. He styled\
  \ it his Magical Ancient Egyptian Dustbin From The Realm Of Thoth, and scratched\
  \ various arcane symbols upon it. He then tried to sell the dustbin to a credulous\
  \ follower, the Dowager Duchess Dipsy of Poxhaven, warning her that she must never,\
  \ ever remove the lid from the dustbin for fear of unleashing several malign demons\
  \ from the ancient mystic city of Gaar. Even poor dim-witted Dipsy saw this for\
  \ the poppycock it was, and she had Algernon Spooky dragged out of her drawing-room\
  \ and beaten to within an inch of his life, with cudgels, by her valet, the one\
  \ time champion wrestler Dinsmore. What happened to the dustbin thereafter is not\
  \ known.\nAlgernon Spooky's illegitimate daughter Poubelle, who acted as his literary\
  \ executrix, consistently denied the existence of the two Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude\
  \ manuscripts. It was only when Pipton bashed her repeatedly on the head with an\
  \ electric toaster that she finally spilled the beans.\n[2016-01-12]"
