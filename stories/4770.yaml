text: "Many a moon ago, back in February 2004, I provided a couple of examples of\
  \ the kind of invective to deploy when writing an unfavourable book review. The\
  \ book in question was Ulysses by James Joyce\u2014he invariably pronounced it \u201C\
  Oolissis\u201D, by the way\u2014and these were the passages I found so diverting:\n\
  \u201CAn immense mass of clotted nonsense\u201D\u2014Teachers\u2019 World\n\u201C\
  The maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or any other time\u2026\
  \ inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty \u2026 a book that one would have thought\
  \ could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum.\u201D\u2014The Sphere\nI can\
  \ now recommend a couple more such tirades, though in this case the book is less\
  \ well-known. Adah Isaacs Menken (1835\u20131868) was an actress, painter, poet,\
  \ possible bigamist, and bareback circus equestrienne, and in the last year of her\
  \ life she published a volume of poetry entitled Infelicia. In order to drum up\
  \ sales, the rumour was spread, perhaps by Menken herself, that some, or all, of\
  \ the poems were in fact written by her pal Algernon Charles Swinburne. However,\
  \ all of them had previously appeared in various American magazines before she even\
  \ met Swinburne. Infelicia\u2018s lack of success may have been due, at least partly,\
  \ to reviews such as these:\n\u201CA wilderness of rubbish and affected agonies\
  \ of yearnings after the unspeakable, which achieve the nonsensical.\u201D\u2014\
  The Athenaeum\n\u201CA bleared panorama of deaths and sighs and blood and tears\
  \ and fire and general gloom and watery ghastliness.\u201D\u2014The Saturday Review\n\
