text: "McCready's friend, Walker, was not the only purblind ultra-crepidarian cobbling\
  \ plays on the theatrical stage two hundred years ago. There were others, none more\
  \ energetic than producer, director, actor, playwright, stage manager, impresario,\
  \ dramaturge, and scene-shifter Jarvis Greasecollar. Damn near forgotten today,\
  \ for the first two decades of the nineteenth century, he had, in George Bernard\
  \ Shaw's words, \u201Cthe advantage of a celebrity that is not idolatry and a regard\
  \ that is untainted by a secret abhorrence of the angry ape posing as a god\u201D\
  , (although Shaw was writing about somebody else).\nGreasecollar made his name with\
  \ the production, in a crumbling theatre in a seaside town, of The Thick Fog, a\
  \ one-act play he probably wrote himself, although some claim it to be an adaptation\
  \ of a jeu d'esprit by Swausage. He followed it, at another crumbling theatre in\
  \ another seaside town, with The Impenetrable Mist, this time a two-act play adapted,\
  \ certainly, from one of Swausage's opera bouffes. Critics from the capital city,\
  \ hearing of the unprecedented enthusiasm of seaside theatregoers, flocked to the\
  \ coast to see for themselves. \u201CSeldom has so purblind an ultra-crepidarian\
  \ cobbled such a play at the seaside!\u201D crowed the (anonymous) critic of The\
  \ Weekly Starling.\nShowered with offers to open his next production at big important\
  \ theatres in the capital, Greasecollar declined, and moved further along the coast.\
  \ In a theatre so crumbled that it was open to the elements, he unveiled Oh! Tenebrous\
  \ Gloom, a three-act play with a cast of hundreds. It opens with the memorable lines\
  \ \u201CCold-hearted orb that rules the night / Removes the colours from our sight\
  \ / Red is grey and yellow white / But we decide which is right / And which is an\
  \ illusion\u201D, a declaration that was to inspire fey long-haired airheads a century\
  \ and a half later.\nFollowing this triumph, Greasecollar was given a knighthood\
  \ and married his leading lady, Edith Sebag, herself no mean ultra-crepidarian,\
  \ though she was never purblind. She collaborated with him on several later plays,\
  \ including The Foul Blizzard, Chasm Of Death, The Little Incey-Wincey Bunny Rabbits,\
  \ and Croaks From A Plague Pit.\nIn 1821, for unfathomable reasons, Jarvis Greasecollar's\
  \ star waned, and not a theatre in the land would stage, nor cobble, one of his\
  \ productions. He fell out with Swausage, endured a mysterious calamity in yet another\
  \ seaside town, and his wife ran off with a dapper gentleman of foreign extraction.\
  \ Years later, she was to play a shadowy role\_as a counter-revolutionary\_in the\
  \ revolutionary turmoil that engulfed a continent.\nIn 1837, by now in quite a disgusting\
  \ state, Greasecollar was found sprawled on a pebbly beach howling at the cold-hearted\
  \ orb\u2026 sorry, at the moon. He was carted off to an asylum, where he died at\
  \ the advanced age of one-hundred-and-twenty-two on the day of Queen Victoria's\
  \ funeral in 1901. A purblind ultra-crepidarian to the last, he toppled from his\
  \ earthly socket into the dust. He left behind an unfinished manuscript, his final\
  \ play, Toppling Into The Dust. It has never been performed, nor cobbled, nor even\
  \ read.\n[2010-08-11]"
