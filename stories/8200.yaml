text: "Yesterday we learned about greasy doings, a regional dish from Arizona. I was\
  \ keen to know more, thinking I might knock together a bowlful for my breakfast.\
  \ Alas and alack, my tireless research yielded only thin pickings. On the other\
  \ hand, among those pickings was this intriguing item, from Momus ; or, The Laughing\
  \ Philosopher, Number LVII\_: The Humours Of A Steward's Entertainment which appeared\
  \ in The Westminster Magazine\_: or, The Pantheon Of Taste Volume 5, Issue 2, June\
  \ 1777:\nHe received me with all that exuberance of civility which amounts to just\
  \ nothing at all, and told me he was transported to see me ; adding \u201CThat he\
  \ expected a few more friends, and that we should dine like Princes, as he had trout,\
  \ venison, pines, melons, iced cream, claret, Madeira, &c. &c.\u201D\nUpon his asking\
  \ me if I would take a walk over the grounds before dinner, I duly gave my assent.\
  \ While we were making a complete conquest of America, by the side of a filbert-hedge,\
  \ a servant came to announce Mr. and Mrs. Allsop. In consequence of this information,\
  \ my Steward, whom I shall call Rackum, ordered him to shew them into the garden-parlour.\
  \ Then turning to me, he said, \u201C'Tis very disagreeable, Sir, to mix with such\
  \ low people ; but as they have had interest enough with my Lord to procure places,\
  \ I am obliged to treat them with decency. Allsop\u2018s father was nothing higher\
  \ than a Cook in the Duke of N\u2014\u2014-\u2018s kitchen ; and indeed, so great\
  \ a propensity has the whole family to greasy doings, that this fellow's elder brother\
  \ keeps an Eating-house not a hundred miles from Porridge Island.\u201D\nBriefly\
  \ diverted by the thought of a conversation taking place by the side of a filbert-hedge\u2014\
  note to self\_: engineer such a chinwag, soon!\u2014I had to concede that this did\
  \ not sound like Arizona circa 1777. Further research reinforced the point, as I\
  \ discovered that, according to The 1811 Dictionary Of The Vulgar Tongue by Francis\
  \ Grose, Porridge Island was \u201Can alley leading from St. Martin's church-yard\
  \ to Round-court, chiefly inhabited by cooks, who cut off ready-dressed meat of\
  \ all sorts, and also sell soup\u201D. Far, far away lies Arizona, then.\nIt is\
  \ always possible that one of the elder Allsop\u2018s customers, delighted with\
  \ his greasy doings, obtained the recipe and then took it with him when he sailed\
  \ across the Atlantic for a new life in the New World. Settling, eventually, in\
  \ Arizona, he may have established a New Porridge Island and fed early Arizonapersons\
  \ with greasy doings.\nIt was when I was imagining this putative person crossing\
  \ the Atlantic that I wondered if, as well as being an alleyway in London, Porridge\
  \ Island might have been one of the mythical islands travellers once believed to\
  \ exist in that mighty ocean. There is an excellent book by Donald S Johnson, entitled\
  \ Phantom Islands Of The Atlantic\_: The Legends Of Seven Lands That Never Were\
  \ (1994), so I checked to see if Porridge Island was one of them. But no. Mr Johnson\
  \ tells us about the Isle of Demons and Frisland and Buss Island and Antillia, the\
  \ Isle of Seven Cities and Hy-Brazil and Saint Ursula And Her Eleven Thousand Virgin\
  \ Companions and the Islands of Saint Brendan, but there is not a jot of porridge\
  \ to be found. Ah well, it was merely a momentary fancy on my part.\nYou will note\
  \ that I chose to insert \u201Cand\u201D between all those islands, rather than\
  \ using commas and saving \u201Cand\u201D to connect only the penultimate and final\
  \ items. This was a wholly conscious decision, because I like \u201Cand\u201D. I\
  \ like \u201Cand\u201D in spite of W G Sebald. Perhaps I should explain. My go-to-guy\
  \ for all things Sebald, Richard Carter, drew my attention to a collection of Maxims\
  \ (PDF) reportedly uttered or muttered by the late lamented. Among these is:\nUse\
  \ the word \u2018and\u2019 as little as possible. Try for variety in conjunctions.\n\
  I cannot agree. \u201CAnd\u201D holds\u2014or can hold\u2014such promise! There's\
  \ more! There are other possibilities! There is further information! And\u2026 and\
  \ occasionally, I suppose, it is better to draw a veil over the next trowelful of\
  \ twaddle to occur to me as I stand beside a filbert-hedge, and to shut up.\n[2012-01-24]"
