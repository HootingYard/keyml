text: "Reading about yet another teenage shooting murder in east London in yesterday's\
  \ paper, I could not help but burst into inappropriate laughter at the name of the\
  \ victim. Her name, apparently, was Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh. \u201CShereka\u201D is\
  \ bad enough, eliding easily into \u201CShrieker\u201D, but \u201CFab-Ann\u201D\
  ? What on earth were her parents thinking?\nI am not sure if it is possible for\
  \ me to re-register the births of my own (now adult) sons, but I am tempted to rechristen\
  \ them Fab-Sam and Fab-Ed. And while we are about it, could I become Fab-Frank?\
  \ Or perhaps With-It-Mr-Key?\nPerhaps the tragic Miss Marsh's parents were fans\
  \ of Thunderbirds.\n[2014-03-25]"
