text: "The launch of the BBC's season of programmes devoted to the 1980s stirred a\
  \ memory, and with it faint pangs of guilt. Older readers will recall that in those\
  \ far off days there was a phenomenon known as Antmania, built around the antics\
  \ of one Stuart Goddard and his pop group, Adam And The Ants. They were, for a while,\
  \ hugely popular, absurdly so, no doubt due to the schemings of their manager, the\
  \ late Malcolm McLaren.\nWhen the hoo-hah was at its height, my pal David Lines\
  \ and I concocted what seemed to us to be a flawless money-making plot. We produced\
  \ a fanzine, entitled Antmania!, using the tools of the pre-internet days\u2014\
  typewriters, Letraset, biros and Xerox\u2014and advertised our eight-page publication\
  \ in the small ads columns of teenybopper magazines such as Record Mirror and Smash\
  \ Hits. I can't recall how much we charged, probably about 50p plus postage, but\
  \ we sat back and waited for umpteen thousand orders to come in. After all, the\
  \ records were selling by the million, beloved by young and old alike. In the event,\
  \ I recall only a handful of copies ever sold, so few that I think we failed to\
  \ cover our photocopying costs.\nWhat our advertisement failed to make clear, and\
  \ the reason for those faint pangs of guilt, is that the content of our Antmania!\
  \ was devoted exclusively to ants, as opposed to Adam And The\u2026 We had facts\
  \ about ants, pictures of ants, even song lyrics about ants, including one about\
  \ a leaf-cutter ant, I think.\nIt is extremely unlikely that there is a Hooting\
  \ Yard reader today who, thirty years ago, was one of the few poor teenyboppers\
  \ who shelled out for a fanzine about their favourite pop group only to be sent\
  \ a few pages of twaddle about ants. But if so, that person is now quite obviously\
  \ sitting on a collector's item which would sell for much more than 50p on eBay.\
  \ It might fetch a pound, or even a fiver. So my guilt is somewhat assuaged.\nI\
  \ no longer have a copy of this seminal publication myself, alas.\n[2010-05-17]"
