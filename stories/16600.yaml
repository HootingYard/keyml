text: "Nimrod Im Duntblau is an opera by Horst Gack, the contemporary composer famed\
  \ for his startling bouffant, ill temper, and near-fatal coughing fits. It is both\
  \ unfinished and unperformed. Several extracts have been recorded, at gunpoint,\
  \ by the Loopy Von Straubenzee Jug Band accompanied by one-time popstrels Ingmar\
  \ & Hetty, the so-called \u201Cterrifying singing twins\u201D. Horst Gack himself\
  \ pointed the gun.\nIn Act One, Scene One, Nimrod arrives in Duntblau. The \u201C\
  mighty hunter before the Lord\u201D is, appropriately, on a hunting expedition.\
  \ He sings that he has heard much about the fabled Chicken of Duntblau, which he\
  \ means to hunt down, pinion, and strangle with his bare hands.\nHe is overheard\
  \ by Schwindi, the Duntblau Postmistress, who is hiding behind an arras. When Nimrod\
  \ exits, she appears and sings the plaintive ballad \u201CMust we swim yet again\
  \ in the blood of chickens?\u201D\nHorst Gack has yet to write scenes two and three,\
  \ but in Act One, Scene Four we find Nimrod, alone in the graveyard of St Bibblybibdib's\
  \ church, leaning insouciantly against a tombstone, smoking a fag, and muttering\
  \ to himself. Because the muttering is punctuated by occasional thumps of a kettledrum,\
  \ Horst Gack counts this as an arietta.\nThe only other scene yet completed is Act\
  \ Seven, Scene Forty-Two. Schwindi is standing outside the Duntblau Chicken Sanctuary,\
  \ holding a placard and singing a dirge. Critics have been sharply divided over\
  \ this lengthy number. In the Macclesfield Tomato Sellers\u2019 Weekly, Trilby Baxter\
  \ dubbed it \u201Ca dire dirge, the direst dirge I ever heard\u201D. (This sentence\
  \ was abstracted by Dennis Beerpint, who used it as the first line of one of his\
  \ twee verses, where \u201Cheard\u201D is rhymed with \u201Cbird\u201D, \u201Ccurd\u201D\
  , \u201Cfurred\u201D, \u201Cbird\u201D again, and \u201Cerred\u201D.)\nOn the other\
  \ hand, writing in the journal Dirges By Gack, Giles Pipstraw commended the piece\
  \ as \u201Cpossibly the most magnificent dirge moaned by a postmistress holding\
  \ a placard outside Duntblau Chicken Sanctuary ever committed to sheet music by\
  \ your friend and mine, Horst Gack!\u201D (The overexcited Pipstraw in fact added\
  \ nine more exclamation marks, which I have omitted for reasons of space.)\nOther\
  \ critics have ignored the dirge entirely, waiting, some would say wisely, for the\
  \ opera to be finished before they pronounce upon it.\nCDs of the recorded extracts\
  \ can be obtained at jumble sales, charity shops, and as part of the contents of\
  \ a jamboree bag available from spivs lurking in insalubrious alleyways in certain\
  \ ill-starred seaside resorts, but not in Duntblau.\nIngmar & Hetty are currently\
  \ on tour with their \u201CEighty Years In Showbiz And Contemporary German Opera\u201D\
  \ special extravaganza.\n[2018-09-15]"
