text: 'A while ago I wrote about hiking pickles, and today I want to address the equally
  important topic of pudding flaps. Flaps about pudding are rarer than they once were,
  chiefly because puddings play a less critical role in our diets than used to be
  the case. Time was when no meal was innocent of a pudding, and though of course
  not every pudding preparation was the occasion of a flap, the incidence of such
  flaps was obviously more frequent. One or two psychoculinary statisticians have
  attempted to put a precise figure on the occurrence of pudding flaps, and one feels
  pity for them, pity mixed with mocking laughter. Sooner or later, I think, we are
  going to have to accept that we will never know how often the making of a pudding
  was done in a state of flap, certainly not to a statistically significant extent.

  The implications of this are, of course, that I may be able to say nothing pertinent
  about pudding flaps save for what I have already said, that they used to be more
  common than they are in the gilded paradise we live in today. And it is a sort of
  Eden, as we zoom around the glistening metropolis in bendy hoverbuses, primping
  our bouffants with space-age preening tweezers, scanning the electronic information
  silos for the latest diktats from our Supreme Leader, the Great Helmswoman Hazel
  Blears, plugging our pods into hubs, enduring cataclysmic hailstorms with undiminished
  joie de vivre, and taking our state-provided One-Pig-Per-Person-Policy pig for a
  brisk walk through the concrete underpasses below the boulevards. Yet some say it
  is a fool''s paradise, and they may be right. Perhaps there is a deep, primeval
  human need to get into a flap when preparing a pudding, whether it is a pudding
  of suet or of plums or of greasy slops. Our loss of those flaps, at least in our
  daily lives, has cost us dear.
