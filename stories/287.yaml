text: "Regular readers know that my grasp of matters ornithological is second to none,\
  \ so it is only fitting that I have been asked to compile an anthology of fictional\
  \ works with the word \u201Cowl\u201D in the title. It might be argued that such\
  \ a task is purely bibliographical and requires no specialist ornithological knowledge,\
  \ but I will defend my ramparts, as one must in this world of rascals and cut-throats\
  \ and people who claim to know rather more about birds than I do. I am used by now\
  \ to lippy slanderers who accuse me of almost fathomless bird ignorance, and though\
  \ I have been known to quail and sob, I try my best to turn my becardiganed back\
  \ on my detractors and get on with the job. So I am pleased to announce that work\
  \ on the anthology is almost complete.\nOne of the works I turned up, and one I\
  \ am annoyed about, and want to take issue with today, is Margaret Craven's 1967\
  \ bestseller I Heard The Owl Call My Name. Now, really! Granted it is a work of\
  \ fiction, but when did you ever hear an owl hoot \u201CMargaret Craven, Margaret\
  \ Craven\u201D? That is simply not the kind of call an owl makes, and to pretend\
  \ otherwise is to be living in a fool's paradise. Of course, as a fictioneer, Ms\
  \ Craven has the right to bend the world to her whim, and I am not asking for blinkered\
  \ stodge, but there are limits to what the reader will accept. And before you start\
  \ arguing that maybe the name the owl calls is not that of the author, but that\
  \ of her protagonist, bear in mind in that case that the owl is calling out the\
  \ name \u201CBrian\u201D. I think you will agree that is equally as idiotic an approximation\
  \ of an owl sound as \u201CMargaret Craven\u201D.\nI Heard The Owl Call My Name\
  \ became a bestseller some years after its initial publication, in the early 1970s,\
  \ alongside such empty-headed slop as Jonathan Livingstone Seagull and Zen And The\
  \ Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance. Coincidentally, my other current project is a wholesale\
  \ rewriting of the latter entitled Roman Catholicism And The Art Of Booster Jetpack\
  \ Maintenance, in which the narrator is a futuristic science fiction Jesuit priest.\
  \ Whether it will sell as ludicrous a number of copies as Robert M Pirsig's mystic\
  \ drivel is another matter.\n[2007-11-18]"
