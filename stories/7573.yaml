text: "Last night I dreamed, not that I went to Manderlay again, yet again, yet again,\
  \ but that I was hanging out with Emerson, Lake, and Lake's mother, but not Palmer,\
  \ of whom there was no sign. It was uneventful, as dreams go, but when I woke I\
  \ did wonder what it might mean, and I decided to ask that question on Facebook\
  \ Facecloth.\nAnswer came from William English, who wrote\_:\_\u201CAfter careful\
  \ consideration it seems obvious that by omitting Carl Palmer, drummer with Atomic\
  \ Rooster, and substituting him with Lake's mother, you are erasing traumatic childhood\
  \ memories of a \u201Cpram cellar\u201D (being an anagram of Carl Palmer). Am I\
  \ right?\u201D\nEek! It has all come flooding back. I shall now undergo rigorous\
  \ recovered memory therapy.\n\nEmerson (present), Lake (present), Palmer (absent),\
  \ Lake's mother (not shown)\nADDENDUM\_: A particularly bewildering point about\
  \ this dream is that I was never an aficionado of the band John Peel invariably\
  \ referred to as Emerson, Lake & Parker, and have never owned any of their music\
  \ in LP or CD form, nor indeed in cassette or 8-track or mp3, nor in any other format\
  \ yet dreamed up by sound reproduction boffins.\n[2011-11-12]"
