text: "In November 2000, a crew from ABC television descended upon Winnipeg to film\
  \ a biopic called Inside The Osmonds. Guy Maddin inveigled himself onto the set.\
  \ A climactic scene was planned in which the actors playing the popsters would stand\
  \ aside, to be replaced by the real\u2014now aged\u2014Osmonds themselves.\nO-Day\
  \ at the Walker Theatre. I'm not even the director and I'm dizzy with fear. Since\
  \ late last night, real Osmonds have been flying in from all parts of Utah, one\
  \ by one: Virl, Merrill, Wayne, Jay, et al.\u2014the first Osmond reunion in seventeen\
  \ years! The Winnipeg that awaits them this morning is locked in a cruel dome of\
  \ permafrost\u2014forty degrees below, and twice as cold with windchill! We Winnipeggers\
  \ pride ourselves on\_ moments like this. Compulsively, we muse about the impact\
  \ our perfrigid town will have on the unsuspecting who visit us. How will the newly\
  \ arrived celebrities cope with being here? Will they be frightened when their nose\
  \ hairs are twisted out by the invisible pincers that stab into one's nostrils at\
  \ temperatures this low? What will Donny make of that first biting mouthful of air\
  \ outside the airport when the cold rips into his lungs like a swallowed scissor?\
  \ Will he wonder why his eyelids have frozen shut as he gropes towards his limo?\
  \ And what will happen to the real parents, George and Olive, now elderly? Will\
  \ the cold simply kill them? Will they be borne home in coffins, in the chilled\
  \ cargo hold of the same plane that brought them here as warm and loving parents?\n\
