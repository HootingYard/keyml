text: "We have previously had William Tell's first, second, and third statements of\
  \ particulars. Here is the fourth.\nI speak as one who, in all good conscience,\
  \ for better or worse, because it seemed, at that time and in that place to be the\
  \ best thing to do, and not just the best, but the most meet, the most valiant,\
  \ if done with both dash and verve commingled with rectitude and punctilio, in front\
  \ of my countrymen there gathered as witnesses, that they might bruit my name far\
  \ and wide and, yea, tell their children and their children's children so that my\
  \ name and my deed go ringing down the centuries, here in Alpine Switzerland and\
  \ further abroad, across all corners of the globe, I speak, I say, and these words\
  \ too will ring down the ages and across the world, as one who, gloriously, and\
  \ patriotically, and with pinpoint precision and an eagle eye, if I say so myself,\
  \ though I am a self-effacing archer not given to boasting about my abilities, even\
  \ so, by any objective measure one must acknowledge my feat, and I blush as I tell\
  \ it, beetroot red, ah beetroot!, king of vegetables, at least for some, but it\
  \ is not a vegetable of which I speak, but a fruit, a fruit I placed atop the head\
  \ of my son, and then stepped back, and hoisted my crossbow, and shot my arrow,\
  \ and clove that piece of fruit in twain, while leaving my son untouched, unharmed,\
  \ though, it has to be said, a mite traumatised, as they would say in the psychobabble\
  \ of a post-Freudian universe, my son crying \u201CPapa! Papa! What on earth did\
  \ you think you were doing, and what if you had missed the fruit and your arrow\
  \ plunged into me, your little son?\u201D, at which I strode toward him and clapped\
  \ him on the back, and told him to buck up and not to be a ninny, and I assured\
  \ him that his name too would resound through the years, as the son of William Tell,\
  \ but I was wrong about that, was I not?, for it seems few, if any, remember the\
  \ name of my son, which was Walter.\n[2013-04-06]"
