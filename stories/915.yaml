text: "I am not sure whether to be amused or nauseated to learn that the cleverest\
  \ person in the known universe is launching Club Fry,\_\u201Can arena, a forum,\
  \ a social network, a sodality, a society for the sharing of knowledge and passions\u201D\
  . Nice to know it's all being organised by what he calls \u201Cmy team\u201D.\n\
  Here at Haemoglobin Towers, I've decided that the only possible response is to set\
  \ up Club Key. Not having a team of spellbound acolytes to do the jiggery-pokery,\
  \ it might take some time to get it up and running. But what can you expect if you\
  \ sign up?\nClub Key members will meet online, once a month, dressed in the club\
  \ uniform of food-splattered cybertunics. Discussion will be limited to ornithological\
  \ topics, for obvious reasons, and grunting, whimpering, whingeing and prating will\
  \ be actively encouraged. Think of it, not as a Club Fry-style arena or forum blah\
  \ blah blah, nor as the modern equivalent of a literary salon or eighteenth century\
  \ coffee house, but as a pond, a brackish and stagnant pond, upon the bottom of\
  \ which you wallow, breathing through a straw poking up into the stale air above,\
  \ which is swarming with midges and gnats. Occasionally members will be given the\
  \ opportunity to sprawl in a virtual drainage ditch, batting away flies and even\
  \ vultures. Both hissy fits and projectile vomiting will be allowed.\nAll club meetings\
  \ will be recorded and posted on YouBoot, a version of the video sharing site which\
  \ concentrates on violent kicking and stamping while wearing big sturdy hiking boots\
  \ of the pixellated variety.\nI have every confidence that this initiative is going\
  \ to take off in a big way, and that we shall easily outnumber the members of Club\
  \ Uberbrain. In fact, I have such faith in the project that to get things started\
  \ I'm going to splatter my cybertunic with genetically modified sponge pudding and\
  \ go and round up some injured swallows from the local injured birds hospice right\
  \ this minute.\n\_\n[2008-11-05]"
