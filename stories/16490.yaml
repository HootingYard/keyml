  \ so pleased with it. I had snapped it up on eBay, where it was going for a song.\
  \ The song I opted for was \u201CEssay On Pigs\u201D (1968) by Hans Werner Henze.\
  \ Strictly speaking, this is actually five separate songs, but I got away with it.\
  \ The Bolshevik Tomato Paste Scoop arrived in the post four days later. I will be\
  \ sure to take it with me, in my briefcase, on my forthcoming trip, by hot air balloon,\
  \ to the Lost City of Karencarpenter, far far away, beyond the mountains of madness,\
  \ where night-penguins fringe a yawning abyss.\n[2018-04-17]"
