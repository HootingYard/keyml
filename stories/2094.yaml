text: "As a doctor his bedside manner was startling. He seemed more intent on reducing\
  \ his patients to gibbering mental wrecks over the state of their souls than curing\
  \ their bodies. Here is an example, the victim being a Mrs Cooper who is on her\
  \ death bed. She seems to have been cheerful enough until Dr Prince arrived.\n\u201C\
  I frequently visited her, and spoke to her most solemnly of her awful state, which\
  \ I put before her in the most appalling picture of death and eternal damnation.\u201D\
  \nThe good lady replied that she was very happy, and prayed to God to take her out\
  \ of her misery. Prince was not impressed; as the illness continued he observed\
  \ that Mrs Cooper appeared to become more wicked and to yield to the most \u201C\
  horrid passions\u201D. These horrid passions were directed at the lady's husband\
  \ who, for some reason, irritated her.\n\u201CShe would damn her husband to hell\
  \ and swear she would tear the eyes out of his head, if she could get out of her\
  \ bed; but the palsy of her legs prevented her\u2026 About three weeks ago, when\
  \ passing her door, I went to see her. I used to have a strange sensation of dread\
  \ when I went into her chamber, as if I realised the presence of Satan about her\
  \ bed, waiting for his prey\u2026 On this occasion I was about to leave her in despair,\
  \ when I thought she seemed to take a little more interest in what I said, when\
  \ explaining the reason that she did not fear death; viz. her own blindness.\u201D\
  \nSensing victory, he pressed on, tormenting the wretched woman with visions of\
  \ hell and damnation. A few days later he announces triumphantly in his journal:\n\
  \u201CThe truth appeared to have flashed upon her suddenly, and was accompanied\
  \ with such conviction and terror, that she quite trembled in bed from fear; to\
  \ use her own words, she \u2018had the horrors\u2019. What a wonder-making God!\
  \ How full of faithfulness and love! \u2018Worthy is the lamb that was slain.\u2019\
  \ Amen.\u201D\nFrom The Reverend Prince And His Abode Of Love by Charles Mander\
  \ (1976)\nDoctor, later Reverend, Prince was Henry James Prince (1811\u20131899),\
  \ founder of the Agapemonites, whose Abode of Love was established in Spaxton in\
  \ Somerset.\n[2009-03-21]"
