text: "I was born in Duntblau, above the wool shop, at the beginning of our night\
  \ that lasts for half a year. The alignment of the stars in the sky over Duntblau\
  \ did not augur well. Shortly after my birth, the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman paid her\
  \ visit, creaking up the fire escape to my parents\u2019 flat above the wool shop.\
  \ She cast her twigs and pebbles upon the floor, and descried signs in the steam\
  \ rising from her bowl of boiling ducks\u2019 blood. She announced that, though\
  \ I was not exactly a curs\xE8d child, still, I was a tot inwardly hobbled, morally\
  \ and comprehensively. There was no force in the universe that could ever come to\
  \ my aid. Mama poured the ducks\u2019 blood down the drain while Papa paid the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman her stipend. As she creaked away down the fire escape, my infant wailing\
  \ woke every sleeping soul in Duntblau.\nThree decades and three more years passed,\
  \ with little or nothing of remark, until one day Papa called me down to the back\
  \ room of the wool shop.\n\u201CShambeko,\u201D he said, \u201CYou have now reached\
  \ the age Christ Jesus was when he was so cruelly nailed to his cross. It is time\
  \ you left Duntblau, to make your way in the world.\u201D\nI begged Papa to allow\
  \ me to postpone my leaving for six months, when there would be daylight, but his\
  \ mind was made up. I was to quit the wool shop immediately, and Duntblau as soon\
  \ as possible thereafter. As I minced out of the door, Mama handed me a snack and\
  \ a bag of whatnots.\nWhen I was out of sight of the wool shop, I collapsed on to\
  \ the pavement and ate my snack, a fish-paste whirl and a plum. Then I rummaged\
  \ through the whatnots in the bag, but my fingers were sticky, so I tipped the contents\
  \ on to the pavement the better to grasp their quiddities. Suddenly dozens of birds\
  \ swooped from the Duntblau sky, grabbing the whatnots in their beaks, and soaring\
  \ away, up, up, until they vanished into the black starless night.\nAfter a while\
  \ I rose to my feet and continued along the street, or rather, boulevard. This was\
  \ one of the main thoroughfares of central Duntblau, and was named after Dave Dee,\
  \ Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich, huge cement statues of whom stood, upon tawdry plinths,\
  \ at intervals from east to west. It so happened that, a couple of schtapps past\
  \ the Beaky statue, where I had snacked and had my whatnots abstracted by birds,\
  \ there was an alleyway leading off the boulevard to the left, and down this alleyway\
  \ was the kiosk of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. I was minded to go and have a word\
  \ with her, but just as I was readying my legs to make the required turn, I was\
  \ set upon by an assailant.\nIt was not the first time in my thirty-three years\
  \ to heaven that I felt the bash of a bludgeon on my bonce. Violence stalks Duntblau\
  \ in the long night. But I had never before been knocked unconscious for such a\
  \ protracted period of time. When I came to, sprawled in the gutter, I heard the\
  \ toots and bangs and bellowing of improvised oompah band music, and saw the massed\
  \ papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 puppets of Duntblau noteworthies being carried aloft. It was\
  \ the Saint Bibblybibdib's Day Parade! I must have been lying in the gutter for\
  \ a fortnight!\nI knew Papa would expect me to be a lot further away by now, possibly\
  \ gone from Duntblau entirely. I knew, too, that he was likely to have employed\
  \ the private detectives Perkins & Throwback to scour the streets for any sign of\
  \ me. He was that kind of Papa\u2014rigorous, righteous, mad. I had to make myself\
  \ scarce.\nI scuttled off down an alleyway. It was a different alleyway to the one\
  \ where the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman had her kiosk, but there is that old saying in\
  \ Duntblau \u201CAll alleyways [something something] / But [something] a ha'porth\
  \ for a kiosk\u201D. Above me the shroud of night lay heavy upon the souls of embittered\
  \ men and their wan, pale wives. The alleyway was scattered with dustbins and corrugated\
  \ cardboard and dead or dying kittens. A dribbling sot lurked in a doorway, shaking\
  \ his fist at nothing. I pulled up my collar as I passed him by. How does that song\
  \ go?\nI pulled up my collar as I passed him by,\nLittle suspecting he was a private\
  \ eye,\nEither Perkins or Throwback, hired by my dad.\nThe end of this story is\
  \ going to be sad.\nThe end of this story is going to be sad. No longer feigning\
  \ sottishness and the dribbling that accompanies it, Perkins, or it might have been\
  \ Throwback, grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled a sack over my head. I was overcome\
  \ by the pong of bladderwrack. The private eye prodded me in the back and told me\
  \ to start walking. So, sightless, I walked, or tottered, Perkins or Throwback guiding\
  \ me like a dog.\nAlso like a dog, indeed so much like a dog that it actually was\
  \ a dog, was a dog that started trotting alongside us after we had been walking\
  \ for, oh, I don't know, call it a few miles. At some point we began to go uphill,\
  \ at a steeper and steeper gradient. I was panting. The dog was yapping. Perkins\
  \ or Throwback seemed tireless, humming a varied selection of tunes by Rodgers &\
  \ Hammerstein, Rodgers & Hart, Leiber & Stoller, Brecht & Eisler, Ashford & Simpson,\
  \ Flanders & Swann, Goffin & King, and Holland, Dozier, Holland, Dozier, Dozier,\
  \ Holland, Holland, Dozier, Holland, Dozier, Dozier, Holland.\nEventually, we stopped.\
  \ The private eye muttered something menacing, and I heard him trudging away. When\
  \ I thought it safe to do so, I pulled the sack off my head and looked around. We\
  \ were high up in an important mountain range, muffled by snow, and ice, and a thick,\
  \ swirling, freezing mist, a white nothingness. The dog had stopped yapping and\
  \ was gazing up at me adoringly.\n\u201CToto,\u201D I said, \u201D I've a feeling\
  \ we're not in Duntblau anymore.\u201D\n[2018-09-12]"
