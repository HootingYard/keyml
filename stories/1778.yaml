text: "Hooting Yard has been threatened with closure by a pointyhead. And no, I don't\
  \ mean airhead \u201Cclosure\u201D, I mean real closure, shutting down, expungement\
  \ from the web. This is apparently because our risk assessment protocols and strategies\
  \ lack robustness and transparency. Mr Key asked the pointyhead where we were going\
  \ wrong, and was told there was an unacceptable risk to \u201Cusers\u201D that their\
  \ heads would become blunter and would need to be sluiced out with a whitewash-based\
  \ fluid, or possibly some kind of gas.\nSticking up for your rights, Mr Key demanded\
  \ that the pointyhead produce evidence to back up so foul an accusation. This was\
  \ duly provided in the form of a cupboard full of documents, all of which had been\
  \ signed by the pointyhead and countersigned by the pointyhead's own pointyhead\
  \ person. By skim-reading just one bulging Lever arch file, Mr Key learned that\
  \ there was a whole hierarchy of risk tsars, risk rapporteurs, risk champions, risk\
  \ adjudicators, and whatnot. It was like theology.\nMr Key set fire to the cupboard\
  \ and pushed the pointyhead into a pond.\_\n[2009-02-13]"
