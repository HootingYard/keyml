text: "Here at Hooting Yard we hate and despise A. A. Milne and all his works. Dorothy\
  \ Parker had it right when, in her \u201CConstant Reader\u201D column in the New\
  \ Yorker, she wrote,\nAnd it is that word \u2018hummy,\u2019 my darlings, that marks\
  \ the first place in The House at Pooh Corner at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up.\n\
  Nevertheless, I am delighted to learn that the \u201CPooh\u201D part of the name\
  \ Winnie-the-Pooh was originally attached to a swan, Pooh being the name Milne's\
  \ son Christopher Robin gave to a swan he befriended in Angmering in Suffolk. If\
  \ I did not have more important things to do with my time, I might go through the\
  \ entire awful canon and rewrite the stories, making Winnie-the-Pooh a savage and\
  \ violent swan instead of an allegedly cute bear. Volume I\_:\_Winnie-the-Pooh Attacks\
  \ Tim Henman And Breaks His Arm.\n[2014-08-16]"
