text: 'A spur to completing the cryptic crossword in the paper each day is the knowledge
  that the solutions may provide inspiration for a piece of prose. Today, for example,
  having cracked the Guardian Crossword No. 24,862 set by Brummie, I find myself considering
  if any useful embroidery can be done with this:

  In Dartmouth, against a background of shamanic doo-wop, a supine organism watched
  as Splotchy Astrid, the reproachful spinster, clambered up the wall of a marl-pit.
