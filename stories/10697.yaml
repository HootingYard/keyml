text: "We bundled our picnic things into gunny sacks and set out upon the road to\
  \ Poxhaven. It is a long straight track, some say a ley line, pitted with many puddles,\
  \ the road to Poxhaven. \u201COh where are you going?\u201D asked passing peasants,\
  \ and we replied, \u201CWe are heading for Poxhaven.\u201D And soon enough through\
  \ mist and rain we saw a signpost and on the signpost, scratched it seemed by the\
  \ claws of a werewolf, were the words \u201CTo Poxhaven\u201D.\nIn centuries past,\
  \ when town and city and countryside were ravaged by the pox, teeming thousands\
  \ fled to safety along this road, to find a haven from the pox in the seaside resort\
  \ of Poxhaven. Now it is for picnics we go to Poxhaven. Even in mist and rain you\
  \ will find no better picnicking spot than among the many many picnic spots of Poxhaven.\n\
  There are werewolves too, werewolves that roam the streets and alleys and mews of\
  \ Poxhaven. In centuries past they fed upon the pox-riddled escapees from town and\
  \ city and countryside who made it as far as Poxhaven. Now the werewolves howl in\
  \ hunger when dusk descends upon Poxhaven. It is a custom, and one we follow, when\
  \ our picnic is done, to leave for the starving werewolves a few leftover picnic\
  \ sausages, injected with the pox, upon a seaside picnic spot in Poxhaven.\nAs we\
  \ trudge home, along the old straight track, in the dusk, we hear the grateful howling\
  \ of the sausage-gobbling werewolves of Poxhaven.\n[2012-12-21]"
