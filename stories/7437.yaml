  \ (2011), reviewed here (thanks to Elberry for the link)\nThe dinner began with\
  \ a soup of asps in simmering oil. On each side was a dish of vegetables, one containing\
  \ thistles and burdocks, and the other fuming acid. Other side dishes, of turtles,\
  \ rats, bats and moles, were garnished with live coals. For the fish course he ate\
  \ a dish of snakes in boiling tar and pitch. His roast was a screech owl in a sauce\
  \ of glowing brimstone. The salad proved to be spider webs full of small explosive\
  \ squibs, a plate of butterfly wings and manna worms, a dish of toads surrounded\
  \ with flies, crickets, grasshoppers, church beetles, spiders, and caterpillars.\
  \ He washed all this down with flaming brandy, and for dessert ate the four large\
  \ candles standing on the table, both of the hanging side lamps with their contents,\
  \ and finally the large center lamp, oil, wick and all. This leaving the room in\
  \ darkness, Dufour's face shone out in a mask of living flames.\nfrom Miracle Mongers\
