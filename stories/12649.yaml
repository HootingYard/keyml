text: "\nChapter Six of Mr Key's Book Of Birds, a work in progress.\nThe roc is a\
  \ type of bird. Actually, it is a fabulous bird, meaning it does not actually exist.\
  \ So it is not entirely true to say it is a type of bird. We might say instead that\
  \ the roc is a type of bird imagined in the heads of persons long ago. Or possibly\
  \ just one person, whose phantasm was adopted by others, yea down the generations\
  \ unto our own days.\n\u201CFabulous\u201D is the root of the slang word \u201C\
  fab\u201D, popular in the 1960s, and surely overdue for a revival. The pop group\
  \ The Beatles were commonly known as the Fab Four, but that is not to suggest that,\
  \ like the roc, they did not actually exist. Or is it? Could the loveable moptops\
  \ be nothing more than a hallucination shared by millions? Could The Beatles be\
  \ a stupendously complex work concocted by the avant garde Japanese conceptual artist\
  \ Yoko Ono (b. 1933)?\nI am not going to argue the case, or provide evidence for\
  \ my theory, in part because it is, to use Ambrose Bierce's favourite word, bosh.\
  \ But it is something well worth thinking about, next time you find yourself at\
  \ a loose end, as for example when a few days go by without any new postages at\
  \ Hooting Yard. I know only too well that in those lamentable circumstances my readers\
  \ are reduced to quivering jellies, sobbing their hearts out and biting great chunks\
  \ out of their hearth-rugs, if they have hearth-rugs to bite chunks out of, or indeed\
  \ hearths, for a hearth is present only where there is a fireplace and with the\
  \ advent of central heating many homes are designed and built now without fireplaces.\
  \ As George Harrison (1943\u20142001) once asked, \u201Cisn't it a pity?\u201D.\n\
  Harrison was a member of the Beatles\u2014either real or imagined by Ono\u2014but\
  \ he asked his question in a song composed and recorded after the group's demise.\
  \ Whether he ever existed or not, what we can say with certainty about Harrison\
  \ is that he was fab. He was as fab as a roc.\nWhich brings us back to the subject\
  \ of our enquiry, the fabulous bird. What can be said, usefully, about a non-existent\
  \ bird? Not much, really. I mean, what on earth is the point of babbling on about\
  \ something that does not exist, and never has existed, except as an idea inside\
  \ people's heads? One cannot even say of the roc, as one can say of so many other\
  \ types of birds, oh! so many, that it has a beak and feathers. Its beak and its\
  \ feathers are as imaginary as the roc itself. It is merely a spectral thing. Upon\
  \ close examination, it disappears from view. Like the Snark, it softly and suddenly\
  \ vanishes away.\nThere is possibly a scholarly essay to be written on whether the\
  \ roc, like the Snark, was in fact a Boojum all along. We might ask the same question\
  \ about George Harrison and the other three Beatles. Having allowed that they were\
  \ indubitably fab, but possibly fabulous, we might consider whether any or all of\
  \ them were Boojums. Some have identified their manager Brian Epstein (1934\u2014\
  1967) as the Boojum, indeed as the Boojum of Boojums.\nAgain, I am not going to\
  \ give chapter and verse, for the simple reason that my reference source is as fabulous\
  \ as the roc. I just made up that Epstein\u2014Boojum comparison, because I could.\
  \ But now I have made it, and posted it on Het Internet, it has become an idea,\
  \ a concept, not unlike an Ono concept. Anybody typing \u201CEpstein\u2014Boojum\
  \ Comparison\u201D into a search engine will find it, and read it, and thus it may\
  \ spread, like wildfire, through the heads of millions, just as Ono's Beatles did,\
  \ just as, over longer centuries, the roc did, or the idea of the roc, that fabulous\
  \ bird which never really existed at all.\n[2014-04-12]"
