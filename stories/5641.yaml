text: 'The television presenter Adrian Chiles read the headline Porpoises rescue Dick
  Van Dyke and was consumed by jealousy. Ever since he was tiny, Chiles had hankered
  to feature in an exciting news story alongside sea creatures, and now his thunder
  had been stolen by the octogenarian pretend chimney-sweep! It was too much to bear.
  Yet, rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick Van Dyke, the West Bromwich
  Albion-supporting anchorman began to plot vengeance against the very sea creatures
  which until now had fascinated him. In his mania, he decided to obliterate the largest
  sea creature he could obtain, to obliterate it in the most disgusting way, by eating
  it. And he decided to make of his revenge a festive occasion, by arranging his foul
  dinner to take place on the day when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. What
  demons swept through his maddened mind, to so finesse his unutterable act? Alas,
  no hint was given of his motives in the newspaper report which followed, in the
  cheaply-photocopied Weekly Cetacean News Roundup, under the headline A Whale''s
  Christmas In Chiles.
