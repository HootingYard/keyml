text: "Last night I dreamed I was a passenger in a minibus. I was accompanied by several\
  \ old friends from years ago and by Quakers. For reasons never explicit, everybody\
  \ in the minibus thoroughly disapproved of me. My sense of this was vivid and distressing,\
  \ and I was very glad to wake from it.\nI told Pansy Cradledew I had had a bad dream.\
  \ \u201CI was the subject of disapproval,\u201D I said. She laughed. \u201CWhen\
  \ people say they have bad dreams you expect them to say \u2018I was terrified\u2019\
  \ or something similar. But no, you were merely subject to disapproval.\u201D She\
  \ found this highly amusing.\nLater I was able to reflect that things could be much\
  \ worse. I learned that Auberon Waugh's maternal grandfather was told by a foolish\
  \ friend that a guaranteed cure for blindness was to have all of one's teeth removed.\
  \ He arranged for this to be done, contracted blood poisoning as a result, and died\
  \ at the age of 43.\n[2015-01-25]"
