text: "There was a period, in my early teenperson years, when I became an avid reader\
  \ of the Reader's Digest. As far as I recall, the younger of my two elder sisters\
  \ brought a copy into the house. I suppose I must have seen it before, in doctors\u2019\
  \ or dentists\u2019 waiting rooms, but this was the first opportunity I had to pay\
  \ it proper attention. I was immediately impressed with it as a physical object.\
  \ It seemed to me like a book rather than a magazine, smaller in size and with a\
  \ spine. As I write that, I realise that the shape and texture and \u2018feel\u2019\
  \ of printed matter was always important to me, particularly when I was younger.\
  \ Anyway, I think I pored over this copy of the Reader's Digest with such enthusiasm\
  \ that I somehow convinced my parents to take out a subscription. Copies were then\
  \ delivered to the door every month for the next couple of years, until I grew bored\
  \ with it and moved on to other things. I haven't bought a copy since, and can barely\
  \ remember the last time I even saw one, so I have no idea if today's Reader's Digest\
  \ (if it still exists?) bears any relation to the magazine I read so keenly.\nI\
  \ used to enjoy doing the word quiz It Pays To Increase Your Word Power, I liked\
  \ the potted biographies and historical articles, and I was amused by the inevitable\
  \ monthly piece warning of the evil godless Communist threat to our freedoms. (It\
  \ would be interesting to re-read those now, when I would probably find my older\
  \ reactionary self nodding in agreement rather than laughing.) But my favourite\
  \ feature was the regular series on the human body, invariably with the title formation\
  \ I Am John's Spleen or I Am Jane's Pancreas. Not being of a scientific bent, I\
  \ don't think I can have paid much attention to the actual texts. But the titles\
  \ I found vastly amusing, and still do. Somewhere in the Hooting Yard archive I\
  \ refer to a supposed Reader's Digest article entitled I Am John's Head. It made\
  \ me laugh when I thought of it and it does so still.\nAll by way of preamble to\
  \ the point that my idea for today's thousandish words was I Am Frank's Brain, though\
  \ of course I would have to rejig the words in the title so it began with \u201C\
  On\u201D. But then I thought, oh dear, that is so stultifying dull and self-referential.\
  \ As any sensible person would, I have a horror of turning into Rachel Cusk, endlessly\
  \ bashing out solipsistic drivel. Luckily, I stopped myself in time, and took a\
  \ break to make a cup of tea. As I stared out of the window at crows and clouds\
  \ while waiting for the kettle to boil, I thought, Aha!, instead of I Am Frank's\
  \ Brain I shall write I Am Rachel Cusk's Brain.\nYou will be relieved to learn that\
  \ I soon thought better than to embark on that particular piece of foolishness.\
  \ It struck me that to enter imaginatively into Rachel Cusk's brain would be to\
  \ court invincible inanity, a risk I was unwilling to take. Rimbaud wrote of the\
  \ \u201Cwhite pointlessness\u201D of the Alps, and I suspect that the vista opened\
  \ up to me by Rachel Cusk's brain would be a greyish, off-white pointlessness.\n\
  Still, I liked the idea of writing a piece based on somebody else's brain. I Am\
  \ Oliver Letwin's Brain? I Am Heliogabalus's Brain? I Am Gwyneth Paltrow's Brain?\
  \ The possibilities were endless. It would be the devil of a job to pick the most\
  \ apt brain to pretend to be. And then, of course, other people's brains can be\
  \ quite unfathomable. I don't know about you, but I can't begin to imagine what\
  \ strange and unruly shenanigans snap between the synapses in the brain of Julian\
  \ Assange. How does someone like that manage to get out of bed in the morning? Easier\
  \ by far, surely, if you are Julian, to just turn over and go back to sleep. Having\
  \ such a brain might be manageable if it was permanently unconscious.\nSpoilt for\
  \ choice, and having discounted the obvious attractions of I Am Yoko Ono's Brain\
  \ and I Am Krishnan Guru-Murthy's Brain, I wondered if the piece might work if I\
  \ chose, instead of a real, or indeed fictional, person, a generic type. I Am A\
  \ Peasant's Brain. I Am An \u2018Occupy\u2019 Protester's Brain. Both of those would\
  \ have the advantage of being decisively limited, so there would not be a great\
  \ deal of material to marshal. On the other hand, neither might make for particularly\
  \ interesting reading. There may be a few more depths to plumb in the brain of a\
  \ peasant, what with responses to the changing seasons and perhaps some crumbs of\
  \ rustic wisdom, but you would probably be better off reading a few passages of\
  \ Lork Roise To Candleford, or better still, watching an episode of the television\
  \ adaptation.\nAt this point I dallied briefly with imagining myself into the collective\
  \ \u201Cbrain\u201D of Lork Roise, positing the rustic hamlet as a sort of organic\
  \ sentient being, but that way madness lies. It would be even more baffling than\
  \ being the brain of Rachel Cusk, I fear.\nWhen all is said and done, probably the\
  \ easiest article to write would be I Am A Crow's Brain. If their raucous cawing\
  \ is anything to go by, and I hope it is, then crows spend their entire lives being\
  \ mightily pissed off, at anything and everything. If you don't believe me, just\
  \ listen to them. I do, daily, and I have to say I find it very rewarding to do\
  \ so. No matter how foul my mood, I can listen to that cawing and think to myself\
  \ that at least I am not as fed up and angry and misanthropic and irredeemably bad-tempered\
  \ as the crow is.\nSo we seem to have gone on a little tour of brains, for what\
  \ it's worth. This is the kind of thing that would fit quite snugly into the Reader's\
  \ Digest. I must find out if it still exists, and, if so, submit this piece to the\
  \ editor. A whole new career might be opening up before me.\n[2012-05-11]"
