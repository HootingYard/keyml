text: "I was interested to note, when solving today's cryptic crossword in the Grauniad,\
  \ a felicitous conjunction of words. The column containing 7 and 19 down, third\
  \ in from the right, reads INFERNAL GAZEBO. Indeed it was both felicitous and a\
  \ jaw-dropping coincidence, for it had long been my intention to write today about\
  \ the infernal gazebo at Plunkett Hall.\nOn our last visit to that grand baronial\
  \ edifice, we learned how, one afternoon in the eighteenth century, Baron Plunkett\
  \ confronted the Evil Thargon. It was several weeks later when the events historians\
  \ call \u201Cthe strange events in the infernal gazebo at Plunkett Hall\u201D took\
  \ place. There are a number of books and pamphlets and tracts and hysterical blood-stained\
  \ ravings on the topic, all of which are worth reading, if you have the time and\
  \ inclination. I have neither, to be quite honest, what with all the other calls\
  \ on my attention, birds, ponds, smokers\u2019 poptarts and what have you, so what\
  \ follows is frankly ill-researched and possibly wrong, wrong, wrong in all particulars.\
  \ But bear with me, because I think you will find it rewarding, in a Radio 4 Thought\
  \ For The Dayish kind of way.\nThe gazebo in the grounds of Plunkett Hall was plonked\
  \ upon one of the magnificent lawns not far from the ha-ha. Architecturally, it\
  \ was an unremarkable gazebo, having been designed by the unremarkable architect\
  \ Baffles Chippy, and built by a gaggle of snaggle-toothed and sullen labourers\
  \ hired for a pittance from the derelict godforsaken villages thereabouts. None\
  \ of these men of peasant stock had an inner life, which was just as well, or they\
  \ might have been haunted forever after by the gazebo they built. Baffles Chippy\
  \ did have an inner life, and a monstrous one, riddled with imps and demons and\
  \ incubi and succubi and all sorts of other awful phantoms of hell that don't bear\
  \ thinking about. But think of them the architect did, constantly, to the point\
  \ of phrenzy. And so, whenever he was commissioned to design a building, be it a\
  \ gazebo or a folly or a seaside chalet, he strived to make it, in his words, \u201C\
  a home fit for heebie-jeebies\u201D, the latter a catch-all term he used for the\
  \ fiends throbbing in his demented brain. Unfortunately\u2014or perhaps fortunately\u2014\
  Chippy was a somewhat cackhanded architect, and the buildings he designed rarely\
  \ if ever reflected his intentions. They might be twee, or gingerbread, or stumpy,\
  \ or base and brickish, but seldom did they look like the ghastly horrors he had\
  \ in mind.\nSo it was with the Plunkett Hall gazebo, which, when finished, looked\
  \ pretty much like any other eighteenth century gazebo in the grounds of a stately\
  \ home. In spite of this, Chippy insisted it be called the infernal gazebo, and\
  \ so it was, by all and sundry.\nOne afternoon in the eighteenth century, the ancient\
  \ factotum Ned Slop came panting and staggering into the library of Plunkett Hall.\n\
  \u2013 Lawks-a-mercy!, baron, he croaked, There's a right to-do over in the infernal\
  \ gazebo by the ha-ha.\nBaron Plunkett looked up from his book.\n\u2013 Must you\
  \ pester me, Slop, when you can see I am making a series of learned annotations\
  \ in my leather-bound Pontoppidan?, snapped the baron.\n\u2013 I beg pardon, baron,\
  \ b-b-but\u2026, said the factotum.\n\u2013 Whatever the to-do is, I am sure you,\
  \ with your untold decades of service and drudgery and fawning and drainage ditch\
  \ draining can cope with it, Slop. Now be off with you, before I ring for the pincers-man\
  \ to come and have at you with his terrible pincers!\nAnd so Ned Slop bowed and\
  \ staggered out of the library and along the corridors and through the great baronial\
  \ hall and out into the magnificent grounds. He tottered slowly across the lawns\
  \ towards the infernal gazebo. He was shaking more than usual, and dribbling with\
  \ fear. But then he remembered he had seen the baron shake a stick at the Evil Thargon,\
  \ just a few weeks ago, and that had seemed to do the trick. So he veered off towards\
  \ a mighty yew and picked from the ground a fallen stick. Waving it in front of\
  \ him, emboldened, he entered the infernal gazebo.\nIt was infested with bats and\
  \ owls and moles and otters. And there, in their midst, stood the unremarkable figure\
  \ of Baffles Chippy. Only now there was something remarkable about him. He was wearing\
  \ a cape and a pointy hat and had sprouted horns and a tail and his feet were naked\
  \ and cloven as those of a goat and his eyes were black black black globules of\
  \ fathomless doom.\nPoor Ned Slop waved his stick, but Chippy, or the thing Chippy\
  \ had become, roared. It was an awful, deafening roar, and the stick burst into\
  \ flames in Ned Slop's wrinkled and cadaverous hand.\n\u2013 Lawks-a-mercy!, he\
  \ cried, not for the first time that day.\nIn his moth-eaten armchair in the library,\
  \ Baron Plunkett scrawled a learned annotation in the margin of his leather-bound\
  \ Pontoppidan. Had he not been as deaf as a post, he would have heard distant rumbling.\
  \ A to-do of cosmic proportions was taking place at that very moment in the infernal\
  \ gazebo. When it was over, there would be nothing left but a few owl-feathers and\
  \ an otter's shrivelled head and the charred remains of Ned Slop's stick and a yawning\
  \ crater, full of fire and vapours and shrieking, black and bottomless, the maw\
  \ of hell.\nThe next day, apprised of the pit, Baron Plunkett ordered that the area\
  \ be surrounded by another ha-ha, and a filbert hedge planted all around it. A gaggle\
  \ of snaggle-toothed and sullen labourers hired for a pittance from the derelict\
  \ godforsaken villages thereabouts toiled and dug, with only a smattering of them\
  \ toppling into the pit. And when they were done, the second of the so-called \u201C\
  strange events in the infernal gazebo at Plunkett Hall\u201D occurred. The gazebo,\
  \ blackened and burned but intact, rose up out of the pit, and hovered awhile in\
  \ the air, and then it shot upwards, at inexplicable speed, and vanished in the\
  \ aether. And ten minutes later, dressed in a spacesuit like Felix Baumgartner's,\
  \ the ancient factotum Ned Slop fell to earth, bumping down in a drainage ditch,\
  \ quite unharmed, but with a brand new and alien brain pulsating inside his skull\u2026\
