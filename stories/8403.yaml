text: "In Elizabethan England, \u201Cthe verge\u201D was an area of legal jurisdiction,\
  \ defined as the territory within a twelve-mile radius of the body of the Queen,\
  \ wherever she happened to be. Thus, a sort of legal, royal \u201Caura\u201D.\n\
  Does anybody know if the verge still exists in the present day, at least in (legal)\
  \ theory?\n\n[2012-02-18]"
