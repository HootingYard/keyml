text: "Here is another example of the Incoherent Twaddle Generation Method. This also\
  \ dates from 1987, and is again from a decisively out of print Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press pamphlet, Forty Visits To The Worm Farm, a story which also appears in Twitching\
  \ And Shattered (1989) and in This Fish Is Loaded\_: The Book Of Surreal And Bizarre\
  \ Humour, edited by Richard Glyn Jones (Xanadu, 1991).\nThe glands of the investing\
