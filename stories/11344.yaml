text: "There is a Dutch word . . . verongelijktheid, to be wronged, not by an individual\
  \ so much as by the world at large. You often see it in the way the much-heralded\
  \ national team plays soccer.\nProud of their superior skills, their multicultural\
  \ makeup, the almost mocking manner of their free-flowing play, maddening the players\
  \ of more prosaic teams, like Germany, the stars of Dutch soccer usually start their\
  \ games with all the swagger of swinging Amsterdam. In their playful individualism,\
  \ their progressive daringness, they know they are the best. And sometimes they\
  \ are. But when things go against them and the plodding Germans, or the bloody-minded\
  \ Italians, or the cussed English, go up a goal or two, the heads slump, the bickering\
  \ starts, and the game is lost in a sour mood of verongelijktheid. Why did this\
  \ have to happen to us? What did we do to deserve this? Aren't we the best? Well,\
  \ fuck you!\nIan Buruma, Murder In Amsterdam\_: The Death Of Theo Van Gogh And The\
  \ Limits Of Tolerance (2006)\n[2013-04-29]"
