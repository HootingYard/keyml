text: "\u201CIt is difficult for wasps suddenly to turn cuddly.\u201D\u2014Theodore\
  \ Dalrymple.\nDifficult, but by no means impossible. In his secret underground laboratory,\
  \ the experimentalist Dr Fang has set up a \u201Cwasp chamber\u201D, to which he\
  \ lures any wasps he comes upon on his perambulations around the perimeter fence\
  \ of his compound. Once the wasp is trapped within the chamber, Dr Fang goes to\
  \ work with what he terms his \u201Cwasp behaviour modification techniques\u201D\
  . These are, of course, never to be divulged to anybody outside the secret underground\
  \ laboratory, so I cannot tell you much about them. By bribing several of Dr Fang's\
  \ hunchbacked troglodyte albino assistants, however, I have learned that the techniques\
  \ involve a serum, a ray gun, spooky buzzing music composed by an argumentative\
  \ German, icing sugar, tweezers, and mesmerism. Please note this is not an exhaustive\
  \ list, so do not try to experiment on a wasp yourself.\nDr Fang remains tight-lipped\
  \ regarding the cuddliness, or otherwise, of his wasp chamber alumnae, which are\
  \ released into the wild when he has finished with them. Those of you who know more\
  \ or less where Dr Fang's compound is located may wish to go picnicking in the vicinity\
  \ on an idle summer afternoon. Remove the lids from your jars of picnic jam and\
  \ picnic marmalade, and wait to see what happens.\n[2009-03-04]"
