text: "News just in that weedy versifier Dennis Beerpint has been appointed Poet In\
  \ Residence at Beppo Lamont's Travelling Big Top Circus. Chief among his duties\
  \ is to write a life in verse of the circus strongman, Lars Tax, also known as The\
  \ Mighty Lars. So strong is Mr Tax that he has been known to hoist o'er his head\
  \ a container lorry cram-packed with smithys\u2019 anvils while pulling a concert\
  \ hall across a field with his teeth. For the duration of his residency, our fey\
  \ poet has been billeted in Lars Tax's caravan, a flimsy construction of balsa wood\
  \ and straw regularly subject to ruinous damage when the strongman engages in such\
  \ mundane activities as yawning or combing his hair. By more or less imprisoning\
  \ him with his subject, it is hoped that Beerpint will dash off a vivid \u201CLife\u201D\
  \ fairly quickly, after which he can concentrate on other Big Top topics, including\
  \ clowns and bears and trapeze artists and lions.\nThree weeks in, Beerpint has\
  \ completed just a single couplet:\nLars Tax was born sixty years ago / But whereabouts\
  \ I do not know.\nThe problem, apparently, is that the circus strongman is a deaf\
  \ mute, and fails to respond to any of the biographical questions fired at him by\
  \ the spindly, neurasthenic poet. \u201CTell me when you first realised you were\
  \ gifted with superhuman strength,\u201D Beerpint will say, and Lars Tax will peer\
  \ at him through his curiously milky eyes then turn about and start pitching cannonballs,\
  \ four at a time, beyond the visible horizon. Luckily, like many a circus strongman,\
  \ Mr Tax is a gentle, kindly soul, and has shown no intention of lifting up Beerpint\
  \ with his little finger and pitching him beyond the horizon.\nAs time passes, however,\
  \ the poet is growing increasingly fretful about his Life In Verse, and is sorely\
  \ tempted to make the whole thing up. It would not be the first time Beerpint has\
  \ cobbled together a fictional rhyming biography of a circus strongman. Which of\
  \ us can forget that majestic sequence A Life Of Circus Strongman Gravat Pang In\
  \ Four Hundred Sonnets? Mr Pang, of Icarus Drumgoole's Fantastic Big Top And Flea\
  \ Circus, was quite the opposite of a deaf mute, a strongman so garrulous that he\
  \ hardly ever stopped talking. Beerpint simply followed him around, scribbling into\
  \ his notepad like a Boswell, and then churned the words into verse.\nWe shall watch\
  \ with interest how this current Big Top residency works out. Rumour has it that\
  \ Lars Tax has grown fond of his puny caravan-mate, and wishes to train him up as\
  \ an apprentice strongman. To this end, the Mighty Lars has been shovelling fistfuls\
  \ of vitamin pills down the poet's throat and encouraging him to push the caravan,\
  \ weighted with several elephants and lions and anvils and cannonballs, from village\
  \ to village, as they travel the land, \u2018til kingdom come.\nDennis Beerpint's\
  \ latest slim volume of twee verse, Limericks Born Of Physical Exhaustion and Vitamin\
  \ Overdose, is available from selected purveyors of slim volumes of twee verse.\n\
