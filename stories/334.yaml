text: "In the post, a very nice letter from Brooklyn poet Gregory Vincent St Thomasino\
  \ responding to the recording of Jubilate Agno:\nDear Frank,\nOnce again I thank\
  \ you for bringing this reading/recording to my attention. It is simply extraordinary.\
  \ It is excellent, it is historical. And if I may, I think it is remarkable the\
  \ having a female voice in the response, this makes the listening easier, never\
  \ monotonous (never wearisome!). The voices compliment and complement each other.\
  \ Smart is my affinity, my kin. He is encyclopaedic. I sense so deeply his sense\
  \ of isolation, I am so deeply moved by his sense of isolation and frustration.\
  \ At the 1:56 time there begins the part \u201CFor I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry\u201D\
  \ and at that pont I followed along in my text. This complete reading of Jubilate\
  \ Agno has not only been a pleasure and an education for me, it has been an episode.\n\
  Yours sincerely,\nGregory\nThe letter has also been posted on Mr St Thomasino's\
  \ e-ratio postmodern poetry blog, where you will find a link to his own Elegy For\
  \ Christopher Smart amid much else.\n[2008-01-09]"
