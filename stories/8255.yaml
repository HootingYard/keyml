  \ stare.\nCome away with me to the Land of Trolls\nWhere we'll live underground\
  \ like a pair of moles.\nBathsheba Gubbins! I know I'm a chump\nBut meet me tonight\
  \ at the village pump.\nLet the villagers mock, let the villagers gawp.\nI am Ah-Fang\
  \ Van Der Houygendorp\nAnd I shall love you till the cows come home\nThey're coming\
  \ home now, o'er the rain-soaked loam.\nWhich of us has not, when in mawkish or\
  \ maudlin mood, sung those words, with tears rolling down our cheeks? Ah-Fang Van\
  \ Der Houygendorp's song of love to his inamorata is both cloyingly sentimental\
  \ and, in its last line, not sentimental at all. Perhaps it is this duality of affect\
  \ that has made it a verse adored, memorised, and recited\u2014while weeping\u2014\
  by the entire nation.\nCuriously, however, the nation in question is neither the\
  \ country of Ah-Fang nor of Mrs Gubbins, but the distant, possibly legendary, land\
  \ of Tantarabim, in which neither of them ever set foot. How The Love Song Of Ah-Fang\
  \ Van Der Houygendorp became so dementedly popular in that faraway land is an instructive\
  \ tale, and it begins with cows, as so many things do.\nSome years ago, a wandering\
  \ minstrel of Tantarabim wandered so far, so very far, that he found himself in\
  \ Jaywick, the jewel of the Essex coast. Plopping himself on a bench outside the\
  \ Never Say Die tavern, he took his piccolo from its cotton pochette and prepared\
  \ to play and sing. Before he could begin, however, out of the mist emerged several\
  \ cows. As luck would have it, the minstrel had arrived in Jaywick on the Sunday\
  \ morning of what is still commemorated, at least in Jaywick, as \u201Cthe day the\
  \ cows came visiting\u201D. Entranced\u2014as who would not be?\u2014the minstrel\
  \ slipped his piccolo back in its pochette and followed the cows in their cowy progress\
  \ around the town. Being a minstrel, he composed a ditty about the experience, which\
  \ he added to his repertoire.\nIt was some years later, outside another tavern in\
  \ another town, still far from his homeland, that the minstrel was interrupted in\
  \ a performance of his ditty.\nOh I have travelled through many lands\nBut none\
  \ so fair as Jaywick Sands\nwas as far as he got before an unkempt dishevelled hairy\
  \ sallow pockmarked greasy infected dippy doo-dah person, with a glass eye and a\
  \ pair of worm-eaten crutches, loomed in front of him, blocking out the sun, and\
  \ boomed \u201CIs this going to be a song about cows?\u201D\n\u201CWhy yes, it is\
  \ indeed!\u201D said the minstrel.\n\u201CI know a better one,\u201D said the unkempt\
  \ dishevelled hairy sallow pockmarked greasy infected dippy doo-dah person, plucking\
  \ out his glass eye and polishing it with a filthy rag, then leaning his crutches\
  \ against the tavern wall and slumping to the ground. And then, in a baritone so\
  \ gorgeous it was barely conceivable that its possessor was one so unkempt and dishevelled\
  \ and hairy and sallow and pockmarked and greasy and infected and dippy doo-dah,\
  \ the stranger sang The Love Song Of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. As he held the\
  \ final note, protracting the word \u201Cloam\u201D to wrench from it more heartbreak\
  \ than is present even in the closing scene of Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942),\
  \ the minstrel burst into tears. He continued to weep as he travelled far and wide,\
  \ was weeping still when eventually he puttered into the harbour at Tantarabim aboard\
  \ a packet steamer, many many moons later.\nNow it must be understood that they\
  \ are a cold-hearted lot, the indigenous Tantarabimers. They snarl and growl and\
  \ grunt, but rarely sob. At screenings of Random Harvest, they are infamous for\
  \ their mockery and chortling and fruit-chucking. Yet now a miracle occurred. The\
  \ minstrel, returned to his homeland, perched on a harbourside crate and slipped\
  \ his piccolo from its cotton pochette and tootled the yearning melody of The Love\
  \ Song Of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. And then, he began to sing the words. Frankly,\
  \ his baritone was weedy and reedy in comparison to that of the unkempt dishevelled\
  \ hairy sallow pockmarked greasy infected dippy doo-dah person, but that mattered\
  \ not a jot here in faraway Tantarabim. Those loitering at the harbour were soon\
  \ weeping, and as he was cajoled to sing the song again and again, so Tantarabimers\
  \ came scurrying from their hovels and caves and country estates, thronging the\
  \ harbour so densely that many were shoved into the sea. Those who could, trod water,\
  \ weeping still. Others drowned. And on and on the minstrel sang, until even the\
  \ thickest and most stupid of Tantarabim fatheads could remember the words, and\
  \ all took up the song, and they sing it still, morning, noon, and night, weeping,\
  \ weeping, in that distant, possibly legendary, land.\n[2012-01-30]"
