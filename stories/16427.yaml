text: "I was not at all certain whether I had any advocates, I could not find out\
  \ anything definite about it, every face was unfriendly, most people who came toward\
  \ me and whom I kept meeting in the corridors looked like fat old women; they had\
  \ huge blue-and-white striped aprons covering their entire bodies, kept stroking\
  \ their stomachs and swaying awkwardly to and fro. I had been told that at least\
  \ three advocates would be assigned to represent me, but if so, where were they?\
  \ And could the case proceed without them?\nI wondered if I had somehow come to\
  \ the wrong building. Perhaps this was not the law courts, but some other branch\
  \ of some other institution of some other regime in some other country on some other\
  \ continent. After all, there was a blank period of several hours, between my waking\
  \ up on my pallet of straw in the barn annexe and my arrival here, several hours\
  \ of which I could remember nothing save for the plaintive cry of a curlew, and\
  \ a smashed saucer on the linoleum.\nDizzy in the head, I sat down on a bench and\
  \ lit my pipe. People continued to mince and waddle along the corridor, seemingly\
  \ with purpose. None of them spared me a glance. None of them announced themselves\
  \ as my advocate. Perhaps I was in the right building but on the wrong floor? I\
  \ had noticed, as I entered from the street, that the building was impossibly tall.\
  \ The top of it was invisible, engulfed by clouds.\nPuffing on my pipe ought to\
  \ have calmed my nerves, but, like poor Neddie in Brand Upon The Brain! (Guy Maddin,\
  \ 2006), I was a bundle of tics. The case\u2014if it were ever heard and judged\
  \ upon\u2014could spell my ruin. I had been accused of plagiarism by the publishers\
  \ of the weekly children's comic The Hammer Of Christ. Among the most popular strips\
  \ in that penny woeful was that recounting the adventures of Buster and Radbod.\
  \ I was deemed to have stolen these characters when I began to issue my own weekly\
  \ children's comic, Buster And Radbod. It was true that, in all particulars, my\
  \ Buster was identical to the original Buster, my Radbod to the original Radbod,\
  \ and that some\u2014well, all\u2014of the adventures I related in my comic differed\
  \ not a jot from adventures pursued by Buster and Radbod in The Hammer Of Christ.\
  \ But apart from those wildly improbable coincidences\u2014and is it not a feature\
  \ of coincidences that they are wild and improbable?\u2014there really was no comparison.\
  \ The paper-size and pagination of the comics was different, my drawings were somewhat\
  \ cack-handed, and the sale price of my publication was four times the price of\
  \ the dreadful rag I was accused of copying.\nIn spite of this, and of my protestations\
  \ of innocence, I had been summoned to the court to face the full wrath of the law.\
  \ But how could I marshal a defence without my promised advocates? Slumped on the\
  \ bench, it dawned on me that my predicament was not dissimilar to a situation faced\
  \ by Buster and Radbod in one of their adventures, which had appeared in The Hammer\
  \ Of Christ Vol. XLIV No. 8 and, coincidentally, in Buster And Radbod Vol. I No.\
  \ 1.\nWhat happened was that the frolicsome duo were summoned to the law court,\
  \ an impossibly tall building, the top of which vanished in the clouds. They had\
  \ to answer a charge brought against them, the essence of which was that they were\
  \ false replicas, or doppelgangers, of the purported real Buster and real Radbod.\
  \ It is a stupendously exciting and suspenseful story, as the pair roam the corridors\
  \ on the many many floors of the building, knowing that at any moment they may come\
  \ face to face with \u2026 themselves! Particularly enthralling\u2014and psychologically\
  \ complex for a children's comic strip\u2014is Buster and Radbod's growing realisation\
  \ that they may not be real, may be simply fictional two-dimensional simulacra.\
  \ Complexity piles on paradox because, of course, neither Buster nor Radbod is real\u2014\
  they are comic strip characters. But so are the so-called real Buster and Radbod\
  \ they will encounter, at some point in the story in the building in a corridor\
  \ on a floor.\nSomehow these reflections made my own situation less fraught. I tapped\
  \ out my pipe, rose from the bench, and went in search of my advocates. It seemed\
  \ to me now that I would be able to spot them easily among the teeming throng. They\
  \ would look identical to me! All three of them! I hunted them along all the corridors\
  \ on the floor, and then I tried the other corridors on the other floors, one by\
  \ one. But before I found my advocates, I noticed a curious thing about the many\
  \ steep and crowded staircases in this building. As long as you don't stop climbing,\
  \ the stairs won't end, under your climbing feet they will go on growing upwards.\n\
  The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Tania and James\
  \ Stern. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-03-29]"
