text: 'But why should I, in so vast an Ocean of Books by which the minds of studious
  men are troubled and fatigued, through which very foolish productions the world
  and unreasoning men are intoxicated, and puffed up, rave and create literary broils,
  and while professing to be philosophers, physicians, mathematicians and astrologers,
  neglect and despise men of learning: why should I, I say, add aught further to this
  so-perturbed republick of letters, and expose this noble philosophy, which seems
  new and incredible by reason of so many things hitherto unrevealed, to be damned
  and torn to pieces by the maledictions of those who are either already sworn to
  the opinions of other men, or are foolish corruptors of good arts, learned idiots,
  grammatists, sophists, wranglers, and perverse little folk?
