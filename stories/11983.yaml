  In this week''s Dabbler there is a third set of Brief Lives (or Brief, Brief Lives),
  involving, inter alia, milk, poultry, and idiots.

  In connection with which, Mr Key is about to embark upon a thrilling project which
  will have the unfortunate effect of becalming Hooting Yard for some while. I will
  still of course be pouring out sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, but for a
  few months there may be fewer postages here than is usual. So if two or three days
  go by without word, do not fret and imagine I have fallen down a mineshaft or met
  with some other calamity.

  News of Project Thrilling will be announced in due time.
