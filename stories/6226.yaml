  Then there is \u2018the culture\u2019, which should not be confused with the occasional\
  \ minor Irish poet winning the Nobel Prize for literature. Various provincial cliques\
  \ and coteries, whether eccentrically Anglo-Irish, or just plain Irish, are inflated\
  \ out of all proportion to their actual significance by their admiring fellows in\
  \ the metropolitan British media. It is also depressing that the only celebrated\
  \ visual art is the political graffiti\u2014known as Muriels in Belfast\u2014that\
  \ adorns the ends of terraced housing. Hollywood contributes its quotient of surreal\
  \ movies about nobly moody Irish terrorists allegedly facing agonising moral dilemmas,\
  \ rather than the reality of intimidating drunks cutting (Republican Catholic) people's\
  \ throats in Belfast bars for such grave offences as spilling their drink, a practice\
  \ that assumed global notoriety after the slaying of Robert McCartney (1971\u2013\
  2005). It can depict Irish-American cops as crooked or psychopathic in such movies\
  \ as LA Confidential or Internal Affairs, but realism departs once the movies are\
  \ about the emerald isle. Drink plays a large role in what is a deeply unattractive\
  \ fusion of sentimentality and violence, where people are quick to take offence\
  \ as Robert McCartney and Brendan Devine discovered (senior Belfast IRA figures\
  \ stabbed and battered McCartney to death in Magennis's bar after Devine had made\
  \ an observation about one of the females in their company). Speaking of bars, dingy\
  \ Irish theme pubs are ubiquitous in Europe, with their fake swirling Celtic tat\
  \ and Guinness, and giant monitors for football and rugby, Gaelic or otherwise,\
  \ which only partially drowns out the relentless, mindless gabbling known as \u2018\
  craic\u2019. Some evenings these places are given over to interminable fiddle and\
  \ jiggy music, or to tear-jerking rebel songs, although a truly weird cultural format,\
  \ consisting of boys and girls hopping up and down with their arms rigid at their\
  \ sides, has even made it on to the West End stage in London.\n[2011-03-17]"
