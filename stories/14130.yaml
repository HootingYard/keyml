  \ did a reading as part of the LitCrawl festival. The photo was taken by one of\
  \ my fellow-readers, Tony White, and also on the bill was Audrey Reynolds. I read\
  \ a couple of stories and also took the opportunity to extol the many and various\
  \ virtues of Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives, waving a copy of the book\
  \ at the audience and reading a couple of extracts. This, for example, provoked\
  \ pleasingly immoderate laughter:\nScott, George R. (British poultry expert, 20th\
  \ century). Scott was the author of the 1934 book The Art Of Faking Exhibition Poultry.\
  \ In the introduction, Socrates, Galileo, Voltaire, Nietzsche and D. H. Lawrence\
  \ are each called to support his attack on the despicable practice, nowhere more\
  \ vile than in \u201Cthe pseudo-scientific Hogan cult, with all its blowsy jargon;\
  \ its crapulous fundament of snide anatomy; its noisy and prolific drool of whim-wham\u201D\
