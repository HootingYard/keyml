  \ follow Hooting Yard on Twitter. I should first of all explain that I never go\
  \ anywhere near that site, all the Hooting Yard updates\u20142.084 to date\u2014\
  being automatically generated every time I update the blog.\nThat said, after blowing\
  \ my raspberry of contempt at Ian Katz it occurred to me that it would be a splendid\
  \ idea if someone tweeted that particular postage at him. I would do so myself if\
  \ I knew how. But in investigating the matter, and thus\u2014for once\u2014going\
  \ to my Twitter page, I discovered, lawks amercy!, that various people who have\
  \ been \u201Cfollowing\u201D me have sent me messages, asked me questions, or generally\
  \ attempted to engage in conversation. All of these have of course been ignored\
  \ because I have never seen them.\nI do not wish these clearly very perspicacious\
  \ folk to think ill of me for not responding to them. So, my apologies, but in future\
  \ I would recommend adding comments here on the blog to those of you who wish to\
  \ communicate. I am not sure I can face the Twitter experience on a regular basis.\n\
