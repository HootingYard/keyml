text: 'On the twentieth day of the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, we show the fair
  city of Plovdiv, home of Ugo and his blind Ma and his pal Ulf, under an eerie post-apocalyptic
  sun, like the sun in a John Martin painting. Put that in your pipe and smoke it!,
  as they used to say, curiously, in British films of the interwar years.
