text: "A letter plops on to the mat from keen Hooting Yardist Roland Clare:\nDear\
  \ Frank, he writes, In view of Hooting Yard's present, thoroughly understandable,\
  \ preoccupation with slobbering, now may be the right time to recall a pleasingly\
  \ Keyesque passage in Virginia Woolf's Orlando:\n\u201C\u2026 the doctors were hardly\
  \ wiser then than they are now, and after prescribing rest and exercise, starvation\
  \ and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should lie in bed all day and ride\
  \ forty miles between lunch and dinner, together with the usual sedatives and irritants,\
  \ diversified, as the fancy took them, with possets of newt's slobber on rising,\
  \ and draughts of peacock's gall on going to bed, they left him to himself \u2026\
  \u201D (p48 of the 2000 Penguin Modern Classics edition).\nMany thanks to Mr Clare\
  \ for that. Inexplicably, it may be the first appearance of the word posset on this\
  \ website. I suspect it will not be the last.\n[2009-01-06]"
