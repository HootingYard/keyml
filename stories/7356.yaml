text: "\u201CAh, Mr Blake. So glad you could make it. Do come in.\u201D\nThe man ushering\
  \ William Blake into his opulent townhouse was a natural philosopher, an alchemist,\
  \ and the owner of a splendid private menagerie.\n\u201CI had better make sure you\
  \ are the right Mr Blake,\u201D he gabbled as he steered Blake into the lobby, \u201C\
  You are the poet and engraver and angel-spotter and occasional nudist?\u201D\nWilliam\
  \ Blake nodded in affirmation.\n\u201CGood, good,\u201D said his host, \u201CLet\
  \ us go then, you and I. Come into the garden, Maud, ha ha!, to quote a pair of\
  \ poems yet unwritten.\u201D\nBlake's eyes boggled as he entered the garden at the\
  \ back of the townhouse. It was a teeming profusion of vegetation, wild and uncultivated.\n\
  \u201CIt is like a forest,\u201D he said.\n\u201CIt is not like a forest, Mr Blake.\
  \ It is a forest!\u201D said the other, and when he spoke, from somewhere in the\
  \ garden came the howling of monkeys and the cawing of strange exotic birds.\n\u201C\
  But this is what I have brought you to see, Mr Blake,\u201D and he pointed towards\
  \ a great stone slab surrounded by choking weeds, upon which was heaped a pile of\
  \ kindling.\n\u201CIf, Mr Blake, you are thinking that it looks like a funeral pyre,\
  \ you are correct. But we must wait for nightfall. Come, let us repair to the gazebo\
  \ and drink lemonade.\u201D\nAnd as William Blake drank from a pewter tankard of\
  \ lemonade in the gazebo, his companion told him a startling thing.\n\u201CIn the\
  \ course of my alchemical researches, Mr Blake, I had occasion to discover an elixir,\
  \ of potable gold and several other ingredients, the drinking of which, unlike this\
  \ lemonade, has conferred upon me eternal youth. I cannot die. I am immortal!\u201D\
  \nBlake could only gawp. The sun sank below the horizon.\n\u201CAt last it is night\
  \ time!\u201D said his host, \u201CCome, let us return to the great stone slab!\
  \ My assistant, Mungo, should be waiting for us there.\u201D\nAs indeed he was,\
  \ a shrivelled and hunchbacked monstrosity with one mad eye. Blake noticed that\
  \ he was holding a length of chain, the other end of which was concealed in the\
  \ shrubbery.\n\u201CThe time has come!\u201D cried the alchemist, \u201CPull, Mungo!\u201D\
  \nWith inhuman strength, Mungo tugged at the chain, and Blake saw to his horror\
  \ and amazement a tiger, dragged from its lair in the lupins and hollyhocks and\
  \ petty spurge. The hunchback somehow managed to pull the tiger up on to the pyre,\
  \ and once it was there he shortened the chain and bolted it to the slab.\n\u201C\
  Excellent work, Mungo,\u201D said the alchemist, \u201CNow go to the gazebo and\
  \ have a refreshing drink of lemonade, then come back with the Swan Vestas.\u201D\
  \nMungo lurched off, and as he did so, the alchemist turned again to William Blake,\
  \ who was still gawping.\n\u201CDo you notice something curious about that tiger,\
  \ Mr Blake? Look carefully. Do you see? It is entirely symmetrical. In one of my\
  \ experiments I set out to breed symmetrical cats, big and small. I am convinced\
  \ that the sight of such creatures will strike fear into those who observe them.\
  \ Well? Are you fearful, Mr Blake?\u201D\nHe was. Such was his terror that William\
  \ Blake ran screaming from the garden, back through the opulent townhouse.\n\u201C\
  Wait, Mr Blake, wait!\u201D cried the alchemist, \u201CYou will miss the burning\
  \ of the symmetrical tiger, the culmination of my madcap schemes!\u201D\nBut William\
  \ Blake had fled, wandering thro\u2019 each charter'd street, near where the charter'd\
  \ Thames does flow.\n[2011-10-05]"
