text: "For some considerable time I have been keeping track of Schneebaumhooft. There\
  \ is a map of the world on the wall of my study, into which I have stuck many many\
  \ pins. They are colour-coded\u2014pinky-red for possible sightings, reddy-red for\
  \ probable sightings, and blood-red for definite and incontrovertible sightings.\
  \ In certain lights, particularly towards evening, the reds look identical, and\
  \ this gives me a certain comfort.\nEach of the blood-red definite sightings of\
  \ Schneebaumhooft is accompanied by a photograph, usually a snapshot taken hastily\
  \ with a concealed camera. These are pinned up on the wall next to the map of the\
  \ world, with a post-it note attached to the edge of each photograph giving details\
  \ of date and location and, where known, the name of the agent who took the snap.\
  \ Many of my agents are unwilling to divulge their identities. I used to make use\
  \ of a system of aliases based on an alphabetical list of seaside entertainers of\
  \ the interwar years, but I became too interested in the entertainers, and spent\
  \ far too much of my time tracking down old end-of-the-pier variety theatre ephemera\
  \ instead of tracking down what I was charged with tracking down, which was Schneebaumhooft.\n\
  As far as I have been able to gather, Schneebaumhooft was never employed in any\
  \ kind of capacity as an entertainer. It is laughable to think of him on stilts,\
  \ for example, or having a custard pie splurged into his face by an accomplice.\
  \ And yet that is how he appears to me in my dreams. Sometimes he is singing a humorous\
  \ song, or doing some business with a couple of napkins and a budgerigar while an\
  \ audience of working-class day-trippers from grim industrial hellholes roar with\
  \ laughter or gasp in wonderment before breaking into applause, clapping punctuated\
  \ with whoops and cheers. When I wake from these dreams I go into my study and gaze\
  \ at the wall, and I am reminded that there has not been a single sighting of Schneebaumhooft\
  \ anywhere near the seaside.\nFor some considerable time I have been wondering why\
  \ Schneebaumhooft is so terrified of the sea. The sea is never still. It is vast\
  \ and it is merciless. Perhaps that is why.\n[2014-10-19]"
