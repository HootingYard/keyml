text: "I am of low birth. If you go back a few generations, my forebears on both my\
  \ mother's and father's sides were peasants, struggling to eke pitiful subsistence\
  \ crops from the muck of Flanders and Ireland. Though my parents themselves had\
  \ risen a little higher in the world, they had not risen by much. I grew up on a\
  \ council estate, and though I too, rose a little, debauch put paid to whatever\
  \ material gains I made, and now I am mired in poverty. Granted, in comparison with\
  \ the poverty of my peasant forebears it is the veriest luxury, yet by modern Western\
  \ standards I teeter on the edge of destitution. In my mind, however, I am a king,\
  \ or, if not a king, at least a baron or a magnifico.\nI am not labouring under\
  \ the delusion that I am some kind of changeling, a prince switched, at birth, with\
  \ a pauper. I have not spent my life in fruitless quest of some illusory document\
  \ that will, if ever found, prove my claim to title, riches, lands and chattels.\
  \ What I mean, rather, is that my material circumstances are of no account in comparison\
  \ to what might be called my attitude\u2014and my attitude is that of Scriabin's\
  \ nobler being who would emerge after the performance of his, alas unfinished, unperformed,\
  \ Mysterium.\nIt has amused me, in recent years, to watch our leaders\u2014worthless\
  \ gits all of them\u2014attempting to deny or disguise their own elevated backgrounds\
  \ and to pretend to a woeful fantasy of \u201Cordinariness\u201D. Of course these\
  \ ploys are based on ruthless political ambition, yet it is laughable to witness\
  \ Blair's estuarine glottal stops, Brown's purported delight in the Arctic Monkeys\
  \ (does anybody remember them?) and Cameron's kitchen sink video clips. I take a\
  \ completely opposite approach to the common people. Our leaders are desperate to\
  \ be at one with them, whereas I rise above them, and look upon them with contempt.\
  \ It is not, perhaps, an attractive quality, but it keeps me getting up in the mornings\
  \ and ploughing my furrow.\nHaving said that material circumstance is trumped by\
  \ attitude does not mean that I am averse to the trappings of nobility, or of royalty,\
  \ if they can be obtained. Such trappings, after all, are merely what I deserve,\
  \ and would be gifted in a more sensible universe. Thus it is that recently I considered\
  \ installing my own household cavalry. The monarch has a household cavalry, and\
  \ I shall have one too! That was the thought sparkling in my brain as I leaped out\
  \ of bed. My penury being what it is, I live in a flat rather than a house, but\
  \ I take the word \u201Chousehold\u201D in its broader definition, as used in the\
  \ census and elsewhere, to mean a separate living unit.\nSo much for the household\
  \ element. Next I will require horses. Though I have never been the keenest aficionado\
  \ of westerns, I have watched enough cowboy films to know that the standard method\
  \ of obtaining several horses is to rustle them. Generally speaking, I abhor theft\
  \ as a mortal sin, one to which the lower classes are habitually prone, as indeed\
  \ are those higher in the social strata, if they think they can get away with it,\
  \ as, regrettably often, they can. I will therefore have to engage in some fairly\
  \ tortuous moral justification if I am to rustle horses, but that is not beyond\
  \ my wit. Weak though the argument is, I can claim that my peasant forebears probably\
  \ rustled a few horses in their time, and thus I am merely obeying the dictates\
  \ of my cultural inheritance. It is not an excuse I would entertain for a moment\
  \ were I a magistrate sitting in judgement over an oiky indigent, but let that pass.\
  \ I shall have to locate a paddock and set out at dead of night for a spot of rustling.\n\
  I have considered the matter of the minimum number of horses required for a cavalry,\
  \ deciding I need four. They will be somewhat cramped in the flat, which cannot\
  \ be helped, but I shall keep the windows open. My downstairs neighbours may be\
  \ disturbed by the clattering of their great iron horseshoes, what Father Hopkins\
  \ described as the drayhorse's \u201Cbright and battering sandal\u201D because it\
  \ rhymed with Felix Randal, the eponymous, if dead, hero of his poem. Perhaps when\
  \ the neighbours hammer upon my door to complain I shall simply fling it open and\
  \ recite Hopkins at them to befuddle their tiny, barely flickering brains. George\
  \ Melly, I recall, used the same tactic when set upon by grunting ruffians one dark\
  \ night outside a pub where he had been singing. As a thug smashed a bottle preparatory\
  \ to enacting savagery upon the chubby jazzman, Melly took from his pocket the book\
  \ he was carrying\u2014a volume of Kurt Schwitters\u2014and began to recite a Dadaist\
  \ sound-poem. The ruffians reeled in cognitive confusion and fell away. (The anecdote\
  \ is given in Melly's memoir Owning Up (1965).)\nFor the feeding of my four horses\
  \ I shall require an enormous supply of hay. Quite where I might obtain it is something\
  \ I have yet to settle. Obviously, were I a dweller in some squalid rustic backwater\
  \ I would have hay coming out of my ears. Instead, I shall have to identify and\
  \ locate urban hay. I am creating a rod for my own back, but that, perhaps, is one\
  \ cost I must pay for having rustled the horses in the first place.\nA second, more\
  \ onerous cost, is that I shall require riders for my horses. And not just any riders,\
  \ but riders dressed from head to toe in livery, livery so gorgeous and ornate and\
  \ Ruritanian that spectators will be almost blinded by it. The livery is not the\
  \ problem. But where on earth am I going to keep the riders? I cannot have them\
  \ cluttering up my flat, gabbling their horsey gabble and quarrelling about their\
  \ epaulettes and generally being loud and boisterous and hearty, as I suspect members\
  \ of a household cavalry are when they are off duty. I suppose I could have them\
  \ break in to the downstairs flat and terrorise the neighbours into fleeing, and\
  \ then set up home there, but in that case it would be unclear exactly whose household\
  \ cavalry they were\u2014mine or the downstairs flat's? Once installed downstairs,\
  \ they would want the horses with them, so I would be back to square one, the only\
  \ difference in my circumstances being a daily delivery of huge bales of urban hay.\n\
  Thinking it through, it may be an idea to modify my plans. Rather than having my\
  \ own household cavalry, I could send my four rustled horses sweeping out across\
  \ the globe, the riders mounted upon them Conquest and War and Famine and Death.\
  \ That will be tickety-boo!\n[2012-06-09]"
