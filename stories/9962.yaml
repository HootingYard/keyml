  \ smoking his umpteenth cigarette of the day. He stared out of the window into the\
  \ gloaming, at the mean fields, like mean streets but without paving and with fewer,\
  \ if any, buildings, and what buildings there were were ramshackle and dilapidated.\
  \ This was a godforsaken rustic backwater, and Ned Mossop adored it.\nNothing much\
  \ ever happened here, which suited Ned, but not his bank manager. He hadn't had\
  \ a case for weeks. Every day he sat in the office glugging hooch and smoking and\
  \ occasionally picking a bit of straw or hay out of his hair. Sometimes, through\
  \ the window, he would watch muck being spread or bonfires lit. But nobody seemed\
  \ to need him. He liked it that way.\nThen suddenly the buzzer on his desk buzzed.\
  \ It was Velma, from the outer office.\n\u201CNed? There's a woman here to see you.\u201D\
  \n\u201COK, pumpkin, show her in.\u201D\nNed took his feet off his desk, knocked\
  \ back the last of the hooch and shoved the empty tumbler in his drawer. And then\
  \ she came in, and his eyes popped out. She was dressed in black, wearing a bippety\
  \ boppety hat with a veil drawn over her face, and her figure was the kind of figure\
  \ that Raymond Chandler would have enjoyed describing with a startling simile.\n\
  \u201CThank you for seeing me, Mr Mossop,\u201D she breathed, in a husky voice that\
  \ almost made Mossop faint with desire. He managed a peasant-like grunt.\n\u201C\
  I had better tell you straight out why I've come,\u201D she said, \u201CIt's about\
  \ my husband.\u201D\nMossop raised an eyebrow. He had tagged her as a widow, what\
  \ with the black dress and the veil.\n\u201COr rather. . .\u201D, she added, her\
  \ voice trembling, \u201CIt's about my husband's cows.\u201D\n\u201CQuit stalling,\
  \ honeybunch, just lay it on the line,\u201D snarled Mossop, curling his lip. She\
  \ had not actually been stalling, but Mossop said that to all the girls.\n\u201C\
  Please, Mr Mossop, be patient with me!\u201D she pleaded, \u201CYou see. . . yesterday\
  \ morning my husband's herdsman discovered seventy-nine of his cows locked in a\
  \ churchyard. They had somehow got in, but then the gate must have slammed shut,\
  \ trapping them there. My husband thinks the cause was that gale that blew in the\
  \ night. Anyway, when the herdsman released them two cows were already dead and\
  \ during the day a further nine cows perished. Why? Why? Why?\u201D\nShe collapsed\
  \ in quivering helplessness. Mossop took a fresh bottle of hooch from his drawer,\
  \ filled a pair of tumblers, and handed her one.\n\u201CLooks like you could do\
  \ with a stiff drink, sister,\u201D he growled, \u201CAnd I suppose you want me\
  \ to find out what happened?\u201D\nThe woman drank the hooch in one gulp and said,\
  \ \u201CWell, yes, Mr Mossop. On your office door it says \u2018Ned Mossop, Cow\
  \ Detective\u2019. Was it silly of me to think you could help?\u201D\nMossop grinned\
  \ a wolfish grin.\n\u201CNot at all, cherrypie. Twenty groats a day plus expenses,\
  \ and I'll see what I can do.\u201D\nShe delved into her reticule and took out a\
  \ handful of bent and dented and filthy coinage. Mossop took it and counted it out.\n\
  \u201CVelma!\u201D he called, \u201CGet the lady a peasant with a cart to trundle\
  \ her home.\u201D\n\nLater that night, Mossop walked the mean fields, all the way\
  \ to the churchyard. The gate was swinging loose. He gave it a kick, and made his\
  \ way among the gravestones. The grasses unloaded their griefs on his feet as if\
  \ he were God, prickling his ankles and murmuring of their humility. Fumy, spiritous\
  \ mists inhabited this place. The moon was no door. It was a face in its own right,\
  \ white as a knuckle and terribly upset. It dragged the sea after it like a dark\
  \ crime; it was quiet with the O-gape of complete despair. The yew tree pointed\
  \ up, it had a Gothic shape. His eyes lifted after it and found the moon. The moon\
  \ was his mother. She was not sweet like Mary. Her blue garments unloosed small\
  \ bats and owls. Inside the church, the saints were all blue, floating on their\
  \ delicate feet over the cold pews, their hands and faces stiff with holiness. The\
  \ moon saw nothing of this. She was bald and wild. And the message of the yew tree\
  \ was blackness\u2014blackness and silence. Satisfied, Ned Mossop lit a cigarette\
  \ and walked out of the churchyard, across the mean fields, as a gale began to blow.\
  \ He did not shut the gate behind him.\n\n\u201COh, Mr Mossop! You startled me,\
  \ trudging uninvited into the cowshed while I am faffing about with mops and pails!\u201D\
  \nShe was wearing the same black dress and bippety boppety hat and veil.\n\u201C\
  Save the dramatics for your husband, sugarplum. I knew all along it was yew.\u201D\
  \n\u201CMe? Why, that's ridiculous!\u201D\n\u201CNot you, yew. Yew trees. Your husband's\
  \ cows died from yew poisoning. The cows got into the churchyard because the gate\
  \ was left open. And who left it open? Joel Cairo! But you knew that, didn't you,\
  \ pineapple chunk, because you paid him. Only not with this filthy coinage you gave\
  \ me, which I am throwing into the muck at your feet in a gesture of contempt. No,\
  \ you paid him in contaminated milk from your husband's herd. You're taking the\
  \ fall.\u201D\nAnd as he spoke, a police car screeched to a halt outside the cowshed.\n\
  \nFrom The Last Englishman\_: The Life Of J. L. Carr by Byron Rogers (2003):\nOn\
  \ 27 October [1967] the Archdeacon wrote again, this time enclosing a letter from\
  \ Maxwell Elliott, a local farmer. \u201CWe have 80 dairy cows grazing regularly\
  \ in the fields adjoining the church, and we have a continued problem of keeping\
  \ the churchyard gates closed. On Monday night, Oct 16, one of the gates had been\
  \ opened some time after 6 pm, and every cow except one spent the night in the graveyard.\
  \ Our herdsman found them at 6 am with the gate closed on them, presumably by the\
  \ gale which blew in the night. Two cows were already dead, and altogether 9 died\
  \ in the course of the day, all proved to be by yew poisoning. There are 3 yew trees\
  \ in the churchyard.\u201D\n[2012-08-23]"
