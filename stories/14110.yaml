text: "Since returning from my jaunt to Belgium I am afraid I have been somewhat indisposed.\
  \ I shall spare you the details. Suffice to say that my brainpans remain in full\
  \ (if uninspired) working order. Fine fettle? I would need to consult a qualified\
  \ fettlist to be sure on that score.\nBut things are gradually getting back to normal.\
  \ There was a new piece in The Dabbler on Friday, and after the Resonance summer\
  \ break Hooting Yard On The Air is back on the air. Last week's show is available\
  \ here, and I ought to remind you that each show now appears on Mixcloud almost\
  \ as soon as it has been broadcast.\nAdded to which, my book Mr Key's Shorter Potted\
  \ Brief, Brief Lives is\u2014at long last\u2014published the day after tomorrow.\
  \ Of which more later.\nIn theory I will be back here tomorrow. Fingers crossed.\n\
