text: "I have had a fabtastic idea for a TV show. It's called Wankers On Hovercrafts.\
  \ Each episode would follow a channel crossing, there and back, by a group of objectionable\
  \ people aboard an outmoded form of sea transport. The idea ticks all the boxes\u2014\
  well, three of them\u2014and would be relatively cheap to produce. I shall set up\
  \ a meeting with a BBC commissioning editor at the first opportunity, and I have\
  \ every confidence that it will get the go-ahead. I mean, it's the perfect TV show,\
  \ surely? When you see me collecting my gong at a future awards ceremony, remember\
  \ where you first read those magic words\u2014Wankers On Hovercrafts!\n[2015-04-28]"
