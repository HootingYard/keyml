text: "Every so often I get a metal tapping machine message from an overexcited television\
  \ person pleading with me to devise a game show based on some aspect of Hooting\
  \ Yard. These people are invariably young and stupid, and I try hard not to be a\
  \ git as I refuse their offers of ruinous wealth and a peaktime viewing audience\
  \ of millions.\nBut I must admit that I was tempted by the latest whizzkid's \u201C\
  concept\u201D, which was to turn The Names Of The Ponds into a thirteen-part series.\
  \ The idea was that each week, a couple of contestants (Brian from Swanage and Carol\
  \ from Jaywick) would stare at a photograph of a pond for fifteen minutes, then,\
  \ after the advert break, use their skill, judgment, and cherished religious beliefs\
  \ to work out which pond they'd been looking at. Stephen Fry would be on hand to\
  \ help them, because he's so clever.\nIt's a quandary, but in the end I think I\
  \ will have to get back to the teenage television person and say No, No, No. But\
  \ that's no reason why you, my loyal readers, should be deprived of the wholesome\
  \ family entertainment such a game provides. So here is a photograph of a crow-surrounded\
  \ pond, courtesy of OSM. Which of the thirteen ponds do you think it is? No prizes,\
  \ I'm afraid, save for a warm glow of Hooting Yard-type bliss.\n\n[2007-02-27]"
