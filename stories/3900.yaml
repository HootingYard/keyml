text: "\u201CFew men, no matter what their calling, can have been the object of so\
  \ many different descriptions as were applied to him\u2026 [Edward George Hemmerde,\
  \ K.C., the Recorder for Liverpool] was variously depicted as \u2018a profligate\u2019\
  , \u2018a wastrel\u2019, \u2018a martyr to the establishment\u2019, \u2018a stormy\
  \ petrel\u2019, \u2018a soured man\u2019, \u2018a good-time Charlie\u2019, and \u2018\
  a man who was much maligned and misunderstood\u2019; he was also\u2026 \u2018an\
  \ irrepressible, loud-mouthed, honourable and outspoken braggart\u2019\u2026 His\
  \ physical perfection was marred by only one thing\u2014or rather, two things: his\
  \ feet. They were enormous. In profile, straight-backed and vastly-booted, Hemmerde\
  \ was shaped like the letter L\u2026 He was conscious, too, of the unloveliness\
  \ of his speaking voice, which, when he was at all excited, rose to a high-pitched\
  \ screech. Since it took very little to get him excited, his voice, almost as often\
  \ as not, was up in the higher registers, causing distress to sensitive ear-drums\u2026\
