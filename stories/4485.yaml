text: "A letter arrives from Miss Kimika Ying, with important bee information:\nDear\
  \ Mr. Key\_: I have been reading a biography of one of the early pioneers of flight\_\
  \ (Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight by Paul Hoffman)\
  \ and today I came upon a delightful passage which made me feel as though I had\
  \ wandered into Hooting Yard. From page 226:\n\u201CThe Wrights\u2019 historic first\
  \ flights, and subsequent ones in Ohio over the next two years, received little\
  \ publicity. Indeed, the first journalist to watch them pilot the Flyer biplane\
  \ in Ohio wrote up what he saw in a magazine for apiarists, Gleanings in Bee Culture,\
  \ and the account did not appear until more than two years after Kitty Hawk. No\
  \ other invention of monumental importance was ushered into the world so quietly.\u201D\
  \nMiss Ying adds that in pursuing her researches, she found a link to a volume of\
  \ Gleanings in Bee Culture, from which she has extracted a couple of quotations\
  \ readers will no doubt find instructive:\n\u201CW. F. Clark says in Annals, \u2018\
  Happy is the bee keeper, who can get possession of an old fashioned, black lace\
  \ veil.\u2019 I think I understand him. With a veil made as follows, no gloves,\
  \ and a pair of fine tweezers to draw out the little beard that sometimes breaks\
  \ off in the flesh, as you take away the sting, you may work with very little fear.\
  \ [some details of veil-making omitted ]\_ N. B.\u2014If you have any very prominent\
  \ features, don't draw the veil too closely.\u201D\nAnd, in response to a gentleman's\
  \ question in which he mentioned his wife's health:\n\u201CIf more of our American\
  \ women were bee-keepers they would know better what health and happiness is possible\
  \ for them in this world of ours.\u201D\nThis is surely nothing but the truth, unalloyed.\
  \ Many thanks to Kimika Ying for drawing it to our attention.\n[2010-05-20]"
