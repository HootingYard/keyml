text: "Mary Bousted, leader of one of the teachers\u2019 unions, was on the radio\
  \ the other day giving her views on the planned new national curriculum. Obviously\
  \ she disapproved of it, because the teachers\u2019 unions automatically disapprove\
  \ of any and all revisions suggested by the government, whichever government is\
  \ in power. What was striking, however, was one of her principal objections. The\
  \ new curriculum, she warned darkly, is \u201Criddled with knowledge\u201D.\nHeaven\
  \ forfend that the teachers in our schools self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity awareness\
  \ hubs should be expected to impart knowledge to the tinies!\nI am left speechless,\
  \ but will merely note that Mary Bousted attended a grammar school and bears the\
  \ title of \u201CDoctor\u201D. I think she must have been taught some \u201Cknowledge\u201D\
  \ somewhere along the line.\n[2013-07-10]"
