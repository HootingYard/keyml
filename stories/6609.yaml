text: "Every so often I find myself devising grand schemes and projects. These rarely\
  \ come to fruition. One that did, probably because it was modest in its ambitions,\
  \ was last year's set of alphabetic postages here at Hooting Yard, where I adopted\
  \ the constraint of posting twenty-six consecutive entries, entitled A through to\
  \ Z. One that didn't was the plan that my pre-Wilderness Years pamphlet House Of\
  \ Turps would be the first volume in a series of twenty-six. I think this scheme\
  \ failed primarily because it was never clear in my then-fuddled brain how the succeeding\
  \ twenty-five pamphlets were intended to relate to the first one.\nSo the likelihood\
  \ is that the preposterous plot hatched this morning will remain incomplete, if\
  \ indeed it is ever even begun. It occurred to me that I ought to devote my time\
  \ to tippy-tapping a blog postage for every single word listed in the Oxford English\
  \ Dictionary, in alphabetical order. According to Oxford Dictionaries, \u201Cthe\
  \ Second Edition of the 20-volume\_ Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries\
  \ for 171,476 words in current use, and 47,156 obsolete words. To this may be added\
  \ around 9,500 derivative words included as subentries\u201D. Since January 2007\
  \ there have been 1,607 Hooting Yard postages (this is the 1,608th) to which one\
  \ can add just short of a thousand entries in the archive for the previous format\
  \ between 2003 and 2006. Clearly I would be taking on a gargantuan task, particularly\
  \ given that I would want each and every postage to be packed with sweeping Dobsonian\
  \ paragraphs of majestic prose. Even if I confine myself to the obsolete words\u2014\
  a highly tempting grand plan in itself\u2014it would take years and years of toil,\
  \ quite possibly more years than remain to me on this spinning terrestrial globe.\n\
  I may, however, make a start, in the near future. Foolhardy, I know, but then I\
  \ am living in a fool's paradise, am I not?\n[2011-05-19]"
