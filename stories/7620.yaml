text: "That conversation, continued\u2026\nElberry\_: what pillow do you use? is it\
  \ stuffed with the feathers of birds or the skulls of mice?\nFrank Key : An admixture\
  \ of cotton wool and sand, wrens\u2019 feathers and wolf hair\nElberry\_: and the\
  \ sand, can you expand on its provenance? do you use the sand from the Alamogordo\
  \ Test Range, or common or garden sand? is it related to the sand nightly deployed\
  \ by the Sandman? Is it sand from the sandy road of Eliot's Waste Land?\nFrank Key\_\
  : It is coarse sand, dredged from the vasty deep, then spread out, by much raking,\
  \ to dry under a Panglossian sun, before being poured into the pillowcase through\
  \ a gorgeous ornate metalwork funnel\nElberry\_: How do you do the dredging? Do\
  \ you have an industrial dredging machine?\nFrank Key\_: I use a mighty concrete\
  \ dredger barge, built to Lambot's original design rather than the later Gabellini\
  \ or Edison models.\nElberry\_: i used to teach at Zeppelin, i think they make dredging\
  \ machines but i am unsure if they are suitable for vasty deeps. Could you just\
  \ use a spade? i ask as i thought about doing a bit of light dredging, to keep fit\n\
  Frank Key\_: Use of a spade beneath the vasty deeps is fraught with risk, but will\
  \ undoubtedly boost your manliness. Or you might drown.\nElberry\_: Heroes don't\
  \ drown, they dredge.\n[2011-11-18]"
