text: "\nTwenty-six years ago, the Malice Aforethought Press published Penitence And\
  \ Farm Implements in an edition of twenty-six copies. Each copy was individually\
  \ lettered from A to Z. The front and back covers contained twenty-six photographs,\
  \ snipped out of (I think) old copies of National Geographic magazine. One of the\
  \ original snippages was pasted in on the inside title page of each copy.\nThe preface\u2014\
  or \u201CA Few Words Before The Drivel\u201D\u2014ran as follows:\nThe seventy-five\
  \ pieces in this book were written between 1981 and 1987; they are arranged here\
  \ in no particular order. Readers whose brains become frazzled by the often turgid\
  \ nature of these poems may prefer to muck about with the illustrative matter; this\
  \ consists of sheets of sticky labels inserted here and there within the book. Indeed,\
  \ it is possible to ignore the texts completely and to spend hours of idle amusement\
  \ rearranging the pictures in jigsaw-like fashion, or to remove the labels from\
  \ the book entirely and use them as charming decorative accessories, guaranteed\
  \ to brighten up the home, office, or slaughterhouse.\nTo which was appended a line\
  \ from John Aubrey's Brief Lives:\n\u201Cafter his Booke came out, he fell mightily\
  \ in his Practize, and 'twas beleeved by the vulgar that he was crack-brained\u201D\
  .\nThe \u201Cillustrative matter\u201D consisted of further snippages from National\
  \ Geographic, printed\u2014in black and white\u2014on to sheets of Gestetner sticky\
  \ labels. Of the written content, the less said the better.\nPenitence And Farm\
  \ Implements is possibly the rarest of rare out of print pamphlets published by\
  \ the Malice Aforethought Press during the last quarter of the last century. I would\
  \ be interested to hear from any long-time Hooting Yard fanatics who actually own\
  \ a copy. There can only be twenty-five of you in total.\n\n[2014-10-21]"
