text: "Few experiences in life are as rewarding as being part of a mob. And of all\
  \ mobs, the baying mob is the best, particularly at nightfall, on the outskirts\
  \ of the village, holding aloft flaming torches and pitchforks, surrounding the\
  \ hovel of a witch or an oddball, forcing them to choose between fleeing or being\
  \ burned.\nAs a veteran of several such baying mobs, I find it exasperating that\
  \ the witch or the oddball so often elicits sympathy. If one were to give credence\
  \ to the witterings of the biens pensants, the do-gooders, and the chattering classes\
  \ around their sophisticated dinner party tables, one might think that there is\
  \ something wrong with brandishing a burning tarry torch and baying for the blood\
  \ of a social misfit. What planet do these people live on?\nIf you are going to\
  \ be an oddball, a mild eccentric, or a witch, then you have to take the consequences.\
  \ And the consequences, rightly in my view, are that me and many many like me, simple\
  \ credulous peasants though we may be, inarticulate and ignorant, will gather in\
  \ the village tavern and grab our pitchforks and torches and march, as dusk descends,\
  \ towards your shabby insalubrious hovel, baying. You may then choose to stay put\
  \ and burn, or make an attempt to flee, bearing in mind that you may not succeed,\
  \ given that we will chase you and overpower you and tear you limb from limb and\
  \ chuck what's left of you into a ditch with a stake driven through your heart.\
  \ That is simply the way of the world or, in contemporary jargon, social cohesion.\n\
  There is much talk of the so-called \u201Cmadness of crowds\u201D as if, in allying\
  \ oneself with one's fellows in a baying mob, one somehow loses all reason. Let\
  \ us not forget that it is the witch, or the oddball, who is the enemy of reason,\
  \ sitting in their hovel with their toads and newts and books, plotting dark and\
  \ devilish deeds. Give them free rein and who knows what foul world they would have\
  \ us inhabit. Better by far that they be stricken with terror at the sight of our\
  \ pitchforks and our flaming torches, at the sound of our blood-curdling baying.\n\
  So come and join us. We meet in the village tavern. Bring your pitchfork and your\
  \ torch. Be part of the mob. It's an experience you won't forget.\n[2013-07-29]"
