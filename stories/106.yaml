text: "I have been asked to write some further words about the golden key to the secret\
  \ fortress of the mysterious Adepts of the hidden tower of the invisible goat deity.\
  \ This key is referred to in Emboldened, In Gumboots, where it is suggested that\
  \ obtaining it, and bringing it back to HQ, was the object of the no longer weedy\
  \ volunteer brevet cadet's dangerous mission.\nRather than babbling on about the\
  \ key, however, I think readers would be better served if I said something about\
  \ the invisible goat deity itself. This goat god was not only invisible, but more\
  \ significantly it was vagrant, in the sense that it was forever wandering around,\
  \ hither and thither, without any apparent purpose. It was for this reason that\
  \ the Adepts had constructed a tower in which to pen it. They let it out to go a-wandering\
  \ on special ceremonial days, and were able\u2014as Adepts\u2014to track its aimless\
  \ scurrying because the deity left a unique carbon footprint wherever it went. Perhaps\
  \ \u2018carbon hoofprint\u2019 is the apposite phrase. The mark of a true Adept\
  \ was an acutely honed skill at offsetting the goat god's carbon hoofprint. So few\
  \ people had even the glimmer of an idea what \u2018offsetting the carbon hoofprint\u2019\
  \ actually meant that there was only ever a handful of Adepts. Easily recognisable\
  \ in their huge blue conical hats, waving their wands, and weighed down by necklaces\
  \ of bones and teeth and jewels and stones and dough, the Adepts spent most of their\
  \ time in their secret fortress, writing lengthy and learned texts about the deity.\n\
  Careful never to reveal how they offset the goat god's carbon hoofprint, they had\
  \ two objectives. As their god was invisible and vagrant, they felt it necessary\
  \ to compile a thorough account of its character, personality, likes and dislikes,\
  \ temper, cogitations, diet, sensibility, and speech-patterns, or rather grunt-patterns.\
  \ Their second aim was to convince the ignorant peasants who lived in the bailiwick\
  \ of the fortress and the tower that the invisible goat was their Creator, and had\
  \ ultimate power over their miserable lives.\nPebblehead's bestselling paperback\
  \ Goat! is a fictionalised account of the exciting day when the goat outwitted the\
  \ Adepts and locked them in the tower, then scampered off to the secret fortress\
  \ and, in the company of a number of other goats, both visible and invisible, munched\
  \ its way through their collected writings, leaving nothing but a clotted, chewed-up\
  \ mass of spittle-soaked scrap paper. No one knows what became of the goat after\
  \ that, for it resumed its vagrant ways, invisible. So ended its goatgodly Dominion,\
  \ which had lasted for just six weeks, in the year of straw, long ago, but not so\
  \ long ago as all that.\n[2007-03-09]"
