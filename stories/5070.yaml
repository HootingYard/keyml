text: "In considering the career of the killer Babinsky, the jaws even of the most\
  \ imperturbable researchers drop when it is realised how frequently the deranged\
  \ brute outwitted the coppers who were forever in pursuit of him. In their chronicle\
  \ A Dull, Workaday Assessment Of The Vile Criminal Babinsky, for example, those\
  \ two old sobersides Totteridge and Whetstone report:\nWhen we thought about the\
  \ seeming ease with which Babinsky always escaped the clutches of the plod, we were\
  \ both bedizened. Totteridge's jaw dropped, while Whetstone banged his head repeatedly\
  \ against a granite wall. (page 429)\nThe received wisdom in the matter is that\
  \ Babinsky had innumerable lairs and hideyholes to which he fled, from caves by\
  \ the seashore to chalets in the hills. While this is of course true, it does not\
  \ address the question of how the lumbering psychopath evaded capture, time and\
  \ time again, between the site of his slaughter and the lair in which he hid.\n\
  Recent research, by a writer who could show Totteridge and Whetstone a thing or\
  \ two when it comes to maintaining the reader's interest, reveals that Babinsky\
  \ was a master of disguise. In Babinsky\u2014Master Of Disguise!, the Korean historian\
  \ of blood-drenched enormities Park No Lip writes:\nNot for Babinsky weedy ruses\
  \ such as the adoption of a limp and the padding out of his cheeks with cotton wool.\
  \ His genius lay in his ability to impersonate real people. Following the slaying\
  \ of the Punch and Judy Man at the end of the pier in Sawdust-on-Sea, over a hundred\
  \ coppers lay in wait for Babinsky on the promenade. They were nonplussed when,\
  \ several minutes after the screams and gurgles had died away, off the pier walked\
  \ Barbey d'Aur\xE9villy, the boulevard magnifico, with the port of a Spanish hidalgo,\
  \ a gold-knobbed cane in his right hand, a little mirror in his left, the one to\
  \ emphasize, the other to confirm his identity. He pranced across the promenade\
  \ on to the boulevard quite unmolested, and made his escape. It was, of course,\
  \ not d'Aur\xE9villy at all. It was Babinsky. The very next day, a few miles inland\
  \ in the awful little village of Gack, he killed a monkey-trainer named Perkins,\
  \ and made such a racket while doing so that dozens of police cars screeched up\
  \ to the hovel wherein the fell deed was done. The coppers formed a ring of steel\
  \ around the hovel and waited for the maniac to emerge. Hours passed. Eventually,\
  \ Detective Captain Cargpan himself, Babinsky's Nemesis, strode to the door and\
  \ banged his big blackbegloved fist upon it. It opened, and there in the fetid gloom\
  \ stood the picturesque, striking-looking parson, the Reverend John Chippendall\
  \ Montesquieu Bellew, whose head of hair was like a great ball of spun white silk.\
  \ A magnificent orator, and adored by women, he lived, becomingly, in an atmosphere\
  \ of adulation constant enough to turn an ordinary man's brain. He certainly turned\
  \ the brains of Cargpan and his toughs, who swooned like girlies as the parson climbed\
  \ into one of the police cars and drove away. Several more hours passed before the\
  \ witless coppers realised that the man they thought was Bellew was, in fact, the\
  \ killer Babinsky!\nPark No Lip labours the point with a dozen or so further examples,\
  \ but it is fascinating stuff and certainly sheds new light on the man they called\
  \ \u201Cthe killer Babinsky\u201D. Next week, we shall be taking a closer look at\
  \ the interior decoration of some of his lairs and chalets, paying particular attention\
  \ to wallpapers and sideboards.\n[2010-08-19]"
