text: "\nAt last! Your chance to announce your unalloyed devotion to Hooting Yard\
  \ by sporting an exclusive Hooting Yard badge! Hand-crafted by unpaid half-blind\
  \ orphans in the dank cellars of Pang Hill Orphanage, the badges measure 25mm across\
  \ and are non-edible, nourishing the spirit rather than the corporeal maw.\nHow\
  \ to order:\n1. Click the Donate button to your right and send \xA31.25 per badge\
  \ to the Keeper of the Hooting Yard Privy Purse. This includes the cost of postage\
  \ and packing and the PayPal clawback. If you live outside the UK you might wish\
  \ to add a widow's mite for extra postage.\n2. Send me an email telling me your\
  \ postal address, with the subject heading \u201CGosh, I am breathless with excitement\
  \ at the prospect of wearing my Hooting Yard lapel badge\u201D, or words to that\
  \ effect.\n3. Allow sufficient time for Mr Key to drag his weary bones to the post\
  \ office to complete the transaction.\nNote for subscribers: Sensible persons with\
  \ a Hooting Yard subscription will be receiving their complimentary badge shortly,\
  \ so need not lift a finger.\n[2011-07-20]"
