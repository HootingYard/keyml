text: "\u201CDear Frank,\u201D writes Richard Carter of Gruts, \u201CThis week's\_\
  New Scientist\_\_(20 September, 2008) contains the rather stirring story of how\
  \ a lone British Antarctic Survey scientist managed to give NASA a red face by discovering\
  \ the hole in the ozone layer with a 50-year-old instrument assembled in a shed.\
  \ The instrument was called a Dobsonmeter.\u201D\nThe Dobsonmeter was invented by\
  \ a certain Gordon Dobson, who may or may not have been related to the out of print\
  \ pamphleteer whose doings are so assiduously chronicled at Hooting Yard. Judging\
  \ by these excerpts from the New Scientist piece, there is a definite affinity:\n\
  Without [Joe] Farman, the truth [about the ozone layer] might not have been discovered\
  \ for several years or more. But he couldn't have done it without his trusty Dobsonmeter,\
  \ first assembled in a shed outside Oxford more than 50 years earlier by another\
  \ dogged researcher, Gordon Dobson from the University of Oxford\u2018s Clarendon\
  \ Laboratory\u2026\nThe odd thing about the Dobsonmeter is that for a quarter-century\
  \ it was an instrument without much use. It finally came into its own during the\
  \ International Geophysical Year of 1957, when researchers decided to make global\
  \ measurements of the ozone layer. They put in an order for around 50 Dobsonmeters\
  \ with the London instrument maker, R. & J. Beck.\nFarman remembers going to Oxford\
  \ to pick up his machine from Dobson in 1956. \u201CEven after 25 years, they hadn't\
  \ completed the instruction manual,\u201D he recalls. \u201CThat only arrived the\
  \ following year.\u201D Farman still has his original copy. For best results, it\
  \ recommends wrapping a quilt round the instrument to keep it warm.\nOnly about\
  \ 120 Dobsonmeters were ever made, of which some 50 remain in use. Each is known\
  \ by its number. Dobson's original, No 1, is in London\u2018s Science Museum. Farman\
  \ made his discoveries with Nos 37 and 51. Probably the oldest still in use is No\
  \ 8, now 73 years old and sitting on the roof of the Norwegian Polar Institute in\
  \ Svalbard. Dobson died in 1976, so he never saw his instrument's finest hour.\n\
