text: "From the archives:\nWhen push comes to shove, I invariably topple over. If\
  \ I am standing on a precipice, or at the edge of a gaping pit, this can be life-threatening.\
  \ Thus, whenever my plans for the day include roaming in the vicinity of a yawning\
  \ chasm, I take precautions by wearing a sort of winch-and-pulley affair, one end\
  \ of which is wound around my torso, under my vest, and the other end of which I\
  \ hammer into a patch of firm ground using a great big iron mallet. I am careful\
  \ to ensure that this end of my winch-and-pulley is stuck fast in the earth, for\
  \ if there is any chance of it working itself loose, the entire activity would be\
  \ pointless, for if, heaven forbid, I were to topple when shoved, my efforts would\
  \ have been in vain, for the crumbling or squelchy soil would yield up my winch-and-pulley\
  \ and I would surely topple as if I had never been attached to anything in the first\
  \ place. That is such a terrible prospect that I make efforts to map out in advance\
  \ the terrain in which I plan to wander, perhaps a week or so ahead. Of course,\
  \ fugitive weather conditions can alter the state of the ground as shown on my charts,\
  \ but risk and chance play a role in all human affairs, and there is no reason why\
  \ my roamings should be exempt. When setting out on my map-making expeditions, I\
  \ usually attach one end of the winch-and-pulley to some stable object like a horse-trough\
  \ or a concrete sundial.\nMy benefactors have long sought to deter me from straying\
  \ near pits, chasms and abandoned mineshafts, so I am afraid I have had to use subterfuge.\
  \ As I wave to them from the garden gate, with the winch-and-pulley concealed behind\
  \ a muffler, I say something like, \u201CI am just going out to check the concrete\
  \ sundial\u201D or \u201CMy my, the day is so clement that I think I will stroll\
  \ along a flat and featureless plain like the big field where Farmer Buzan used\
  \ to grow his potatoes all those years ago\u201D. Sometimes such announcements will\
  \ be met with questions, which I am usually able to anticipate by peering at the\
  \ furrowedness of my benefactors\u2019 brows. At other times I may have to improvise\
  \ a convincing response or deflect the queries by pointing at a starling, for example,\
  \ or forcing a sudden spray of projectile vomiting. When push comes to shove, pointing\
  \ at a starling is my preferred option.\nIt is twenty years now since I bashed in\
  \ Farmer Buzan's head with his own spade. I like to think that my benefactors trust\
  \ me these days, but it seems not. Oh look, there's a starling in that sycamore\
  \ tree!\n[2015-03-21]"
