text: "\nYou will need to read Key's Cupboard in The Dabbler with particular care\
  \ this week. I am planning to use each of the phrases listed therein as the punchline\
  \ of a spectacularly well-crafted and hilarious joke, each joke to form one chapter\
  \ of a spectacularly well-crafted and hilarious comic novel. The critics will be\
  \ helpless with laughter, and I shall be awarded laurels.\nThat, at any rate, is\
  \ the plan. If it has a flaw\u2014oh, and it does! it does!\u2014it is that I am\
  \ not much of a gag-writer. So that is where you lot come in. Readers are invited\
  \ to provide me with jokes to which the lines listed in the cupboard are the perfect,\
  \ irresistible punchlines. I will then cobble them all together into the funniest\
  \ novel ever written.\nNaturally, I will take full credit, to make certain of getting\
  \ those laurels wrapped around my head. Your reward, and it is a fine one, will\
  \ rest in the knowledge that your wit and hilarity is represented by a laurel leaf\
  \ touching the bonce of Mr Key. Whingers and ingrates may be further placated by\
  \ having their names scribbled on the leaves with non-permanent marker pens. I can't\
  \ say fairer than that, can I?\n[2011-02-25]"
