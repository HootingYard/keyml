  \ had them, hopping short in the measure of convulsion-fits; in which labour the\
  \ agony of his wit having escaped narrowly, instead of well-sized periods, he greets\
  \ us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies. \u2018He has a fortune therefore good,\
  \ because he is content with it.\u2019 This is a piece of sapience not worth the\
  \ brain of a fruit trencher\u201D\nJohn Milton, An Apology For Smectymnuus or An\
