text: "Speaking of barbarians, as I did yesterday, it's not often that you come upon\
  \ the chieftain of a barbarian horde whose name is Chauncey. So I was pleased to\
  \ learn about such a chap this morning, when I popped into my local Andy Burnham\
  \ Chat \u2018n\u2019 Snack Zone, fought my way through a gaggle of feral hoodies,\
  \ and sought refuge in the cupboard where a few reference books had been stashed.\
  \ Soon, I am sure, they will end up in a lime-pit to join the quarter of a million\
  \ books wilfully destroyed by Waltham Forest Council in the last couple of years,\
  \ but for now, at least, I had a chance to browse through them for anything which\
  \ might catch my eye.\nAnd it was an article about Chauncey that I lighted upon,\
  \ in a big fat book called A Biographical Dictionary Of Barbarian Chieftains Who\
  \ Swept Across The Plains With Their Hordes On Horseback Wreaking Mayhem And Leaving\
  \ Ruination In Their Wake; With Six Maps And Twenty-Six Mezzotints. Most of the\
  \ entries were for barbarian chieftains with names like Hengist and Blegvad and\
  \ Hagblod, so it was quite a surprise to find one called Chauncey. His full name\
  \ was given as Chauncey Kittenridge III, and to me that sounded more like a blue-blooded\
  \ Boston Brahmin than a barbarian chieftain, but what do I know?\nActually, it turned\
  \ out that Chauncey was indeed the spawn of a wealthy New England family, destined\
  \ for a career in the banking sector, but that, once astride a horse, some sort\
  \ of atavistic impulse impelled him to barbarism and sweeping across the plains\
  \ at the head of a horde. Throughout history, the plains favoured by barbarian hordes\
  \ for sweeping across, from west to east, have been those that stretch from Asia\
  \ into Europe, so Chauncey was miffed to find himself on an inappropriate continent.\
  \ Thus it was that he bid farewell to the living members of the Kittenridge dynasty\
  \ and made his way to Asia, picking up ruffians as he travelled whom he impressed\
  \ into the ranks of his horde. He was careful to choose only bloodthirsty thugs\
  \ who sat well upon horses, for he intended, when the time came for sweeping across\
  \ the plains, to be fearsome in the extreme, and it would not do to have among his\
  \ horde the feckless or the merciful or the weedy.\nChauncey himself, however, never\
  \ lost the impeccable manners that had been drummed into him from childhood, and\
  \ even at the height of his barbaric career was as much at home in the dining room\
  \ of a grand hotel as he was setting fire to a barn in some godforsaken village\
  \ that had the misfortune to be in his path as his horde swept across the plains.\
  \ As a chieftain, Chauncey had a natural air of authority, and he added to it by\
  \ sprouting a magnificently hairy beard and by festooning his person with big battered\
  \ bits of jewellery and raiment. These were not the sorts of adornments that could\
  \ be mistaken for girly fripperies, for they were heavy and chunky and some were\
  \ not even of precious metals, but were fashioned from the bones and pelts of slaughtered\
  \ animals, usually those that charged, terrified, out of the barns the horde set\
  \ fire to as they wrought mayhem in their sweeping progress from east to west leaving\
  \ ruination in their wake. Chauncey was particularly fond of a necklace made from\
  \ the ribcages of goats and chickens, and he liked to polish this with a rag as\
  \ his horde encamped for the night, warmed by the blaze of a burning barn.\nIt has\
  \ been argued that, had Chauncey not been so keen on barbarism, he would have made\
  \ a fine military commander in the conventional sense. He certainly knew how to\
  \ keep his horde loyal to him, and suffered no mutinies. He had the knack of instilling\
  \ camaraderie among his vicious ruffians by encouraging rousing sing-songs as they\
  \ laid waste to villages and hamlets, songs often of his own composition, usually\
  \ taking for their subject matter episodes of violence and havoc and chaos close\
  \ to his heart. Sprightly numbers such as Ho! Boys! Let Us Burn Down The Barn!,\
  \ Hey! Ho! Boys! Let Us Pillage The Village! and Hidey Hey! Ho! Boys! Let Us Cast\
  \ The Library Books Into A Lime-Pit! might have topped the pop charts had such things\
  \ been on the radar of a barbarian horde, but of course they were not, and the very\
  \ idea that they could have been is simply a foolish fancy, diverting as it may\
  \ be to imagine a Eurovision or Asiatic Song Contest in which the winners are a\
  \ tangle of bloodsoaked barbarians festooned with goat-and-chicken-bone necklaces.\n\
  According to the Biographical Dictionary, Chauncey eventually succumbed to ennui.\
  \ His barbarian horde had swept across the plains from east to west, doubled back,\
  \ swept across them again, headed back and swept across them yet again, dozens of\
  \ times, wreaking ruination, and it appears there came a point when Chauncey felt\
  \ that the urges within his soul had been placated. At night, he began to have dreams\
  \ of lawns in New England upon which he would sprawl, wearing a boater and sharing\
  \ a picnic with a socialite. When giving orders to his horde, his voice turned to\
  \ a drawl, as if he were Gore Vidal reminiscing about the Bouviers and the Kennedys\
  \ and the Auchinclosses. He yearned to attend a weekend party at a Chappaquiddick\
  \ marina. And so, one vile morning on the outskirts of a destroyed village somewhere\
  \ on the plains across which he was sweeping, he announced that he was disbanding\
  \ the horde. He paid off his thugs with hogsheads of bitter grog and distributed\
  \ among them his baubles of bones and jewellery, and then he galloped upon his horse\
  \ to a city with a swish hotel, where he booked in and shaved off his mighty beard.\n\
  Some weeks later, his barbaric bloodlust decisively a thing of the past, Chauncey\
  \ boarded a transatlantic liner, ready to return home and to exchange a mess of\
  \ pottage for his birthright. He had not written ahead to the Kittenridges, but\
  \ he was confident that he would meet with a warm welcome, and if he did not, was\
  \ prepared to slip back temporarily into barbarism and unleash pitiless violence,\
  \ even without his horde to back him up. In the event, it was not a choice he was\
  \ forced to make, for the transatlantic liner on which he embarked was the jewel\
  \ of the White Star Line, the Titanic, and he went down with it in the icy waters\
  \ of the North Atlantic.\n[2008-11-04]"
