text: "\u201CThere is a farm in Burton, a village in the parish of Weobley, which\
  \ Mr William Bridges, a linen draper of London, has in mortgage from one Thomas\
  \ Tomkyns, a decayed yeoman. This farm was taken in by lease of Mrs Elizabeth Bridges,\
  \ about Michaelmas 1669. Soon after this tenant was entered on the farm, some familiar\
  \ began to act apish pranks by knocking boldly at the door in the dark of the evening,\
  \ and the like early in the morning, but nobody to be seen. The stools and forms\
  \ [benches] were thrown into disorder, heaps of malt and vetches mingled, a mow\
  \ of pulse and pease likewise; loaves of bread on a table carried into another room,\
  \ or hid in tubs covered with cloths; cabbage plants dug up and replanted in various\
  \ patterns; a half-roasted pig demolished except for the bones; some cattle died\
  \ and among others a sow leaped up and danced in strange postures, and at last fell\
  \ down dead.\u201D\nAccount of a seventeenth century poltergeist, quoted in Peter\
