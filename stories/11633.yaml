text: "\u201CThe patient was a respectable artisan of considerable intelligence, and\
  \ was sent to the Cambridgeshire Asylum after being nearly three years in a melancholy\
  \ mood. . . . He spent much of his time in writing\u2014sometimes verses, at others\
  \ long letters of the most rambling character, and in drawing extraordinary diagrams\
  \ . . . After he left the Asylum he went to work at his trade . . . but some two\
  \ or three years later he began to write very strangely again . \_. .\n\u201CThis\
  \ is one of the letters he wrote at this time, after a visit from a medical man,\
  \ who tried to dissuade him from writing in this way\_: \u2013\nDear Doctor,\nTo\
  \ write or not to write, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to\
  \ follow the visit of the great \u2018Fulbourn\u2019 with \u2018chronic melancholy\u2019\
  \ expressions of regret (withheld when he was here) that, as the Fates would have\
  \ it, we were so little prepared to receive him, and to evince my humble desire\
  \ to do honour to his visit. My Fulbourn star, but an instant seen, like a meteor's\
  \ flash, a blank when gone.\nThe dust of ages covering my little sanctum parlour\
  \ room, the available drapery to greet the Doctor, stowed away through the midst\
  \ of the regenerating (water and scrubbing\u2014cleanliness next to godliness, political\
  \ and spiritual) cleansing of a little world. The Great Physician walked, bedimmed\
  \ by the \u2018dark ages\u2019, the long passage of Western Enterprise, leading\
  \ to the curvatures of rising Eastern morn. The rounded configuration of Lunar (tics)\
  \ garden's lives an o'ershadowment on Britannia's vortex.\n\u201C\u2026 In the course\
  \ of another year he had some domestic troubles, which upset him a good deal, and\
  \ he ended by drowning himself one day in a public spot. The peculiarity was, that\
  \ he could work well, and not attract public attention, while he was in his leisure\
  \ moments writing the most incoherent nonsense.\u201D\nfrom On The Writing Of The\
  \ Insane by G. Mackenzie Bacon (1870). Available online at the Public Domain Review.\n\
