  One thing is abundantly clear. I am going to have to write a story to which this\
  \ picture can serve as an illustration. I expect that in my tale Tiny Tim will be\
  \ cast aside and replaced by Tiny Enid. The plucky heroine has not, to date, found\
  \ herself concealed inside the hollow head of a mechanical man, so it is about time\
  \ she did.\nYou can see the original source of the picture at Monster Brains.\n\
