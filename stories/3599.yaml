  \ a conference-holding organisation, devoted to the idea of synthesis\u2026 The\
  \ distinguished lecturers were not themselves psychologists. They had their own\
  \ terminologies, historical, anthropological, religious, scientific, literary, artistic,\
  \ political. Their views were the opposites to be reconciled\u2026 Then there was\
  \ \u2018wholeness\u2019 and \u2018becoming a person\u2019, but otherwise not much\
  \ Jungian undertow, certainly not enough to bother me. With the whole idea of the\
  \ thing, I was intellectually uninvolved. It was simply that every now and then\
  \ I would get on a train to Oxford and spend a week gassing with distinguished chaps,\
  \ many of them amusing. Most of the time, my interests lay decidedly elsewhere.\
  \ Only later did I begin to think of Jung as perhaps the most pernicious brain-softener\
  \ of our time.\u201D\u2014Rayner Heppenstall, The Intellectual Part (1963)\nHeppenstall\
  \ (1911\u201381) was an interesting character. In addition to writing novels, memoirs\
  \ and criticism, he was an early English enthusiast\u2014and translator\u2014of\
  \ Raymond Roussel. There is an essay about him by G J Buckell here, which points\
  \ out that he is forgotten and out of print, and suggests one reason for the neglect\
  \ is that he grew increasingly reactionary with age. Buckell says the last novel,\
  \ The Pier, is \u201Can uncomfortable diatribe\u2026 indicative\u2026 of a psychological\
  \ collapse\u201D. On the contrary, it is a small masterpiece. It is not clear to\
  \ me why the espousal of reactionary views is, in and of itself, evidence of mental\
  \ instability.\nHere is Heppenstall in fine form, again from The Intellectual Part:\n\
  \u201CIt had, as a matter of fact, been on starting to read a poem by T S Eliot\
  \ that I first questioned the good sense of writing poems at all. That had been\
  \ in the autumn of 1940\u2026 A copy of The New English Weekly had come in the post.\
  \ It contained a long new poem, East Coker, by T S Eliot. I turned to the poem with\
  \ some eagerness. It began:\nIn my beginning is my end\u2026\n\u201CI flung the\
  \ paper across the room. It was like a signature tune. The poem might just as well\
  \ have begun:\nThis is T S Eliot speaking\u2026\nIn due course, I picked up the\
  \ paper and read the rest and no doubt liked some of it, as I do now. It is not,\
  \ after all, in that poem that Mr Eliot bids us so oddly to pray for fishmongers.\u201D\
  \n\nRayner Heppenstall\nADDENDUM\_: Speaking of prayers for fishmongers, Eliot may\
  \ have been thinking of this.\n[2010-01-02]"
