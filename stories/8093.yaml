text: "There is something terribly dispiriting about a clunk, any clunk. Have you\
  \ ever known a clunk to harbinge anything majestic and life-enhancing? I do realise,\
  \ by the way, that \u201Charbinge\u201D, as a verb derived from the noun \u201C\
  harbinger\u201D, is not in the dictionary, but it damn well ought to be. Clunks\
  \ spell disrepair, flaws, ruination, even doom.\nImagine for example that you are\
  \ an avid bell-ringer. It is Wednesday evening, the time of your weekly bell-ringing\
  \ practice at St Bibblybibdib's church, that lovely old church with its magnificent\
  \ belfry. It is the kind of belfry in which bats are said to hang upside down, resting\
  \ between their nocturnal swoopings in search of tiny scurrying things to eat. Or,\
  \ depending on the type of bat, fruit. But you care not a jot for the bats, you\
  \ think only of the bells, and their pealing. Tonight you will be rehearsing an\
  \ Angelus with your fellow bell-ringers, Mat and Nat and Sacheverell and Chlorine.\n\
  In your parlour, you look at the clock. It is time to get ready. You scamper up\
  \ the stairs two at a time and throw open the bedroom wardrobe in which you keep\
  \ your bell-ringing gear. Heart already thumping with the sheer excitement of the\
  \ practice session to come, you put on your bell-ringer's tunic and your bell-ringer's\
  \ gloves and your bell-ringer's pointy cap. You swallow a vitamin pill. You look\
  \ at your reflection in your gleaming bell-ringer's boots. You hare down the stairs\
  \ and you leave a bowl of food for your pet cat, David Carpenter. David Carpenter\
  \ is out and about, chasing in vain squirrels or birds or otherwise making a fool\
  \ of himself, but when the time comes for his return home, he will shimmy through\
  \ the catflap. You take one last preen in the hallway mirror and then you leave\
  \ the house, locking the door behind you.\nThere are several bells dangling at the\
  \ top of the bell-tower of St Bibblybibdib's. They are still and silent, awaiting\
  \ you and your chums.\nIt is a windy evening. You pull your pointy cap down, snug\
  \ against your cranium. Out through the gate and along the lane you prance, buffeted\
  \ yet spry. Ahead of you looms the lych gate of the lovely old church. Sometimes,\
  \ atop the roof of the gate, you have seen, appropriately, a lych owl, or screech\
  \ owl, perched. But there is no owl there this evening. Perhaps it was chased away\
  \ by David Carpenter, who you see now, sprawled on the churchyard wall, taking a\
  \ nap.\nYou click open the lych gate and enter the St Bibblybibdib's churchyard.\
  \ All the familiar mossy toppling gravestones are there, and you glance at the one\
  \ that reads JOHN UNANUGU, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE, wondering if at long last somebody\
  \ might have scrubbed the filth of centuries from it to reveal John Unanugu's dates\
  \ of birth and death. But no, the gravestone has not been touched since you were\
  \ last here, on the previous Wednesday evening, for bell-ringing practice.\nOn a\
  \ bench by the church door sits Sacheverell, smoking his pipe. He too is wearing\
  \ his bell-ringer's tunic and his bell-ringer's gloves and his bell-ringer's pointy\
  \ cap. He is wearing his bell-ringer's boots, too, but they do not gleam as yours\
  \ do. They are scuffed and grubby, for Sacheverell is a stranger to boot polish.\
  \ You greet each other. Sacheverell indicates that Mat and Nat and Chlorine have\
  \ already arrived, and are inside St Bibblybibdib's, presumably undertaking various\
  \ pre-bell-ringing activities. He knocks out his pipe on the side of the bench,\
  \ inadvertently killing an ant. Many more ants will die later tonight, in the darkness,\
  \ swooped upon and gobbled up by bats.\nThe pair of you enter the church. There,\
  \ in the gloom, Mat and Nat and Chlorine are faffing about. This is for you always\
  \ a thrilling moment, just before you go into the bell-chamber and set the bells\
  \ a-pealing. You are not quite breathless with excitement but there is a definite\
  \ quaver in your voice as you say hello to your chums.\nAnd then you are ready to\
  \ rehearse the Angelus. Each of you grasps their sally. Nat is the first to pull\
  \ on his bell-rope, and he sets his jaw determinedly as he does so. But instead\
  \ of the clang you all expected, there comes a clunk! At some point during the past\
  \ week, a crack has appeared in the bell, by dint either of yobboes or metal fatigue.\
  \ There will be no Angelus this evening.\nThat is an example of one particularly\
  \ dispiriting clunk. I am sure you can think of many more.\n[2012-01-11]"
