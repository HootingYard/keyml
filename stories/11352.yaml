text: "In a comment on Knitting & Catastrophe, someone calling themselves \u201CWho\
  \ are you?\u201D gets very prickly and accuses me of all sorts of perfidy. I am\
  \ assuming this must be Dr Jonathan Faiers himself, familiar as he is with the contents\
  \ of Dr Faiers\u2019 email inbox.\nI wrote to him, you see, to alert him to the\
  \ fact that the film Sightseers is a splendid example of knitting and catastrophe\
  \ in the cinema. And I wrote because I think \u201Cknitting and catastrophe in the\
  \ cinema\u201D is a brilliant, brilliant theme, for which Dr Faiers should be applauded.\
  \ Alas, he ignored that praise, preferring to become enraged by my comments about\
  \ the deadly horror of academic prose\u2014all those \u201Cinterrogations\u201D\u2014\
  and heaped insult and invective upon me. Which rather goes to prove my point\u2014\
  he is clearly capable of writing vivid prose, so why must he couch his lecture in\
  \ such clogged-up blather?\nAnyway, I mention this as an excuse to direct your attention\
  \ to a comment by\_David Thompson, which neatly summarises everything that is wrong\
  \ with academic art talk, specifically \u201Cinterrogations\u201D (and \u201Cexplorations\u201D\
  ):\nA while ago, I suggested a drinking game involving random art press releases.\
  \ Every time you spot the word \u2018explores\u2019 or \u2018interrogates\u2019\
  \ you take a swig of tequila. Oblivion would beckon very quickly indeed. These words\
  \ are all but obligatory\u2014it's a way to signal phony intellectual heft\u2014\
  and given the context, they're usually meaningless. The particulars of this alleged\
  \ mental activity\u2014all this exploring and interrogating\u2014never seem to be\
  \ stated clearly, and no conclusions ever seem to be reached or announced to the\
  \ public. But that's because these words aren't meant to refer to reality. You'll\
  \ see they're used pretty much randomly. They're just there to let the credulous\
  \ punter know that the artist is supposed to be clever and therefore deserving of\
  \ attention and taxpayer subsidy.\n[2013-04-30]"
