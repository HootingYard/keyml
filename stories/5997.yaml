text: "Another snippet from Marina Warner's Phantasmagoria\_: Spirit Visions, Metaphors,\
  \ And Media Into The Twenty-First Century (2006):\n\u201CAfter the death of his\
  \ much loved daughter L\xE9opoldine in a drowning accident, Victor Hugo became very\
  \ involved in table-turning, planchette or Ouija board experiments, and other means\
  \ of contacting spirits. L\xE9opoldine frequently spoke to him. But he also began\
  \ receiving copious messages from all kinds of visitors, including Dante, Galileo,\
  \ and Voltaire, and even \u2018the Ocean\u2019, who held forth to the company in\
  \ an astonishing outpouring of rhetorical bombast scattered with furious expletives.\
  \ Some of the communications passed straight into print. As someone observed at\
  \ the time, \u2018Victor Hugo was channelling Victor Hugo\u2019.\u201D\n[2011-02-04]"
