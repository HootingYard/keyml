text: "Yesterday I received an annoying email from a company\u2014probably run by\
  \ teenagers\u2014called SOS.\nHi Frank!, it began, overfamiliarly. I don't know\
  \ why I continued reading after such effrontery, but I did.\nHere at SOS we're passionate\
  \ about helping you maximise traffic to your website. SOS stands for Search Optimisation\
  \ Solutions, and that's exactly what we do!\nLike a fool, I carried on reading.\
  \ I suppose I was won over by the thought that I could attract more than thirty-four\
  \ readers. I became even more interested when SOS gave me one of their so-called\
  \ \u201Csimple yet effective\u201D tips without my having to pay them a penny.\n\
  Our research shows that web traffic increases a millionfold if you mention three\
  \ names on your site. We call them The Three Ks\u2014Kate, Kim, and Keith. That\
  \ is, Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian, and Keith Potger.\nI am now racking my brains\
  \ trying to work out how to concoct a story which includes the Duchess of Cambridge,\
  \ the inexplicable celebrity, and a quarter of Antipodean 1960s pop sensations The\
  \ Seekers, which is at once (a) credible, (b) morally uplifting, and (c) groovy.\
  \ If any of the thirty-four of you have any ideas, please let me know in the Comments.\n\
  UPDATE : Gosh! Since I posted the above, an hour ago, traffic to Hooting Yard has\
  \ increased to a whopping thirty-six! Thanks a million, SOS!\n[2017-08-02]"
