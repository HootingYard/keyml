text: "[Feb. 2, 1895.] I venture to send you the following story I have lately heard\
  \ from an eye-witness, and to ask whether you or any of your readers can throw any\
  \ light upon the dog's probable object. The dog in question was a Scotch terrier.\
  \ He was one day observed to appear from a corner of the garden carrying in his\
  \ mouth, very gently and tenderly, a live frog. He proceeded to lay the frog down\
  \ upon a flower-bed, and at once began to dig a hole in the earth, keeping one eye\
  \ upon the frog to see that it did not escape. If it went more than a few feet from\
  \ him, he fetched it back, and then continued his work. Having dug the hole a certain\
  \ depth, he then laid the frog, still alive, at the bottom of it, and promptly scratched\
  \ the loose earth back into the hole, and friend froggy was buried alive! The dog\
  \ then went off to the corner of the garden, and returned with another frog, which\
  \ he treated in the same way. This occurred on more than one occasion; in fact,\
  \ as often as he could find frogs he occupied himself in burying them alive. Now\
  \ dogs generally have some reason for what they do. What can have been a dog's reason\
  \ for burying frogs alive? It does not appear that he ever dug them up again to\
  \ provide himself with a meal. If, sir, you or any of your readers can throw any\
  \ light on this curious, and for the frogs most uncomfortable, behaviour of my friend's\
  \ Scotch terrier, I should be very much obliged.\u2014R. Acland-Troyte.\n[Feb. 9,\
  \ 1895.] I think I can explain the puzzle of the Scotch terrier and his interment\
  \ of the frogs, for the satisfaction of your correspondent. A friend of mine had\
  \ once a retriever who was stung by a bee, and ever afterwards, when the dog found\
  \ a bee near the ground, she stamped on it, and then scraped earth over it and buried\
  \ it effectually -presumably to put an end to the danger of further stings. In like\
  \ manner, another dog having bitten a toad, showed every sign of having found the\
  \ mouthful to the last degree unpleasant. Probably Mr. Acland-Troyte's dog had,\
  \ in the same way, bitten a toad, and conceived henceforth that he rendered public\
  \ service by putting every toad-like creature he saw carefully and gingerly \u201C\
  out of harm's way,\u201D underground.\u2014Frances Power Cobbe.\nFrom Dog Stories\
