text: "One has to admire Mr and Mrs von Hohenheim, the parents of Paracelsus (1493\u2013\
  1541), for giving their tot the Christian names Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus\
  \ Bombastus. Two things worth remembering about Paracelsus are that he was the first\
  \ person to call zinc zinc\u2014actually he called it zincum\u2014and that he kept\
  \ a small avian devil imprisoned in the pommel of his sword. Samuel Butler noted\
  \ this in Hudibras, where he wrote:\nBombastus kept a devil's bird / Shut in the\
  \ pommel of his sword, / That taught him all the cunning pranks / Of past and future\
  \ mountebanks.\n\n[2011-01-30]"
