text: "Peacay, the onlie begetter of BibliOdyssey, draws my attention to the excellent\
  \ Book Of Accidents Designed For Young Children (1831).\nI'm sure this must have\
  \ been a set book for the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage. The anonymous author \u201C\
  conceives he cannot render a more important service to the rising generation and\
  \ to parents, than by furnishing them with an account of the accidents to which\
  \ Children, from their inexperience or carelessness, are liable. If generally studied\
  \ it will save the lives of thousands, and relieve many families from the long and\
  \ unavailing misery attendant on such occurrences\u201D. Among the potential mishaps\
  \ addressed in this invaluable book are Playing With Horses, Worrying Dogs, Scalded\
  \ At The Table, Playing With Fire-Arms, Falling Out Of A Coach, and Troubling The\
  \ Cook.\nThere are some sample pages here, where you will also find a link to the\
  \ entire book online.\n[2008-06-25]"
