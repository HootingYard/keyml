text: "[Continuing, seamlessly, from where Tokenism left off \u2026]\nAfter several\
  \ minutes, bidding farewell to the goats, Poumfrex descended from his mountain fastness.\
  \ His unexpected return home to Tea Strainer House, family pile of the centuries-old\
  \ Poumfrex tea strainer manufacturing dynasty, was not unlike the unexpected return\
  \ home of Charles Rainier in Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942). Just as we weep,\
  \ uncontrollably, at any viewing of that film, so there was weeping within the walls\
  \ of Tea Strainer House, and outside, in its gardens too.\nThere was one significant\
  \ difference. Charles Rainier, played by Ronald Colman (1891\u20131958), sports\
  \ a dapper moustache. Poumfrex did not. He had grown one once, in his youth, when\
  \ first able to, but it had sprouted in an entirely different colour to the rest\
  \ of his hair, which, at that time, was browny tawny chestnutty, with flecks of\
  \ ginger and black. The colour of the incipient moustache was indescribable. It\
  \ appeared to be a shade outwith the known spectrum, and thus it provoked remark,\
  \ usually unkind remark, and this was unwelcome to Poumfrex, who in his youth was\
  \ shy and self-conscious. He was no longer so, but he chose never to revisit moustacheland.\n\
  He felt himself touched by the copious weeping which greeted his return, and pranced\
  \ like a ninny through all the halls and corridors of his beloved home, blowing\
  \ kisses and waving his arms. He gave little thought to the sad fellow with the\
  \ coupons he had been paid to escort and who had thrown himself down a well. Poumfrex's\
  \ communion with goats in the mountains had restored the boisterous and bright-eyed\
  \ optimism which came naturally to him.\nWhence it came was a deep mystery, for\
  \ all the other members of his clan were sombre and sour and moody and pernickety\
  \ and rancorous and morose and always, always, weeping, gushing great buckets of\
  \ tears at the faintest of plucks on their heartstrings.\nBut he was happy to be\
  \ home, and he avoided the sounds of constant wailing and keening, once he had done\
  \ his tour of the house, by taking a turn around the gardens. Here were the filbert\
  \ hedges and ha-has, the lupins and hollyhocks and topiary tea strainers of his\
  \ childhood. Memories came flooding back as he pranced like a ninny in the torrential\
  \ rain. He remembered the day he saw gnomes hiding behind the hedges. He remembered\
  \ the Great Watering Can Party. He remembered the visit of Neville Chamberlain with\
  \ his odd-shaped head. He remembered lying on his back on the lawn in the middle\
  \ of the night, gazing up at obsolete constellations of stars. He remembered digging\
  \ Ruskinian holes, and filling them with conkers. He remembered Mr Snippage, the\
  \ old head gardener, who looked like the aged Ruskin, and, like Ruskin, had hallucinatory\
  \ visions of snakes.\nWhile Poumfrex was happily remembering all these things in\
  \ the garden, an unaccustomed silence had fallen inside the house. There was no\
  \ longer any weeping, no wailing nor keening. Just like in Three Days Of The Condor\
  \ (Sydney Pollack, 1975), where CIA analyst Joe Turner, played by Robert Redford\
  \ (b.1936) pops out of the office for five minutes and returns to find all his colleagues\
  \ have been slaughtered, so when Poumfrex stepped back in through the French windows\
  \ he discovered that every single occupant of Tea Strainer House had been done to\
  \ death while he was prancing like a ninny around the garden.\nPoumfrex had a nose\
  \ for crime. As he wandered through the halls and corridors of his beloved home\
  \ counting the bodies, one idea impressed itself with more and more intensity upon\
  \ his brain. This must be the work of the lumbering walrus-moustached serial killer\
  \ Babinsky!\n[To be continued \u2026 ]\n[2015-02-10]"
