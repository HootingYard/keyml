text: "Perhaps it is simple good manners that impels me always to read the \u2018\
  Acknowledgements\u2019 section in a book. More often than not this will be a list\
  \ of names, almost all unknown to me, and institutions whose doorways I have never\
  \ breached. Sometimes the tone is fulsome, sometimes arch, but in general writers\
  \ keep it neutral and flat. It is always a pleasure, then, to find a jarring note,\
  \ such as this:\nIn London I continued in what was by now an established pattern\
  \ of finding kind and knowledgeable people and shamelessly exploiting them. These\
  \ included, most notably, Dr. Ruth Paley, then of the Public Record Office, and\
  \ Harriet Jones and Louise Falcini, both of the London Metropolitan Archives. Such\
  \ happiness, however, was not destined to last, for my next stop was the new British\
  \ Library. There I encountered a staff that was impervious to exploitation in any\
  \ form; indeed, such was their fondness for reading The New York Review of Books\
  \ that many could scarce find the time or energy to help readers humbler than themselves.\n\
  Sadder but wiser, I returned to Toronto.\nJessica Warner, in the PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,\
  \ Containing As Many DISCLAIMERS as EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE, along with Divers\
  \ ENCOURAGEMENTS to the READER, in Craze\_: Gin And Debauchery In An Age Of Reason\
