text: "I have been watching, with something akin to hysterical overexcitement, reruns\
  \ of the long-running television game show Guns Before Butter. It really is the\
  \ most fantastic example of Bismarckian light entertainment ever devised. As is\
  \ often the case with these things, the basic format is very, very simple, one might\
  \ almost say simple-minded. A contestant, plucked from the studio audience, is faced\
  \ with two small tables. On one table is a stack of guns, on the other a packet\
  \ of butter. All they have to do is choose. If they choose correctly, they win a\
  \ souvenir propelling pencil and a spiked helmet. If they choose incorrectly, the\
  \ studio audience hisses and boos, and the shamed contestant is bundled backstage\
  \ to face who knows what godawful fate. The simplicity of the game lies in the fact\
  \ that, of course, the guns are always the correct choice. That much is evident\
  \ from the show's title.\nOne might think that the format drains any possible dramatic\
  \ tension from the show. Nothing could be further from the truth. As each new contestant\
  \ is hustled on to the stage to be embraced in a bear hug by the smarmy host, one\
  \ never knows if they will have sufficient wit to chose guns before butter. I have\
  \ been unable to gain clearance to show a clip here, so I have done the next best\
  \ thing and made a partial transcript of a typical episode.\nSmarmy Host : And let's\
  \ have a big and deafening round of applause for our next contestant!\n[Big, deafening,\
  \ round of applause. Hooters, klaxons, screaming.]\nSmarmy Host : And your name\
  \ is?\nContestant\_: Horst.\nSmarmy Host\_: And where are you from, Horst?\nContestant\_\
  : Obergrumpelschwittenzollern, Trevor.\nSmarmy Host : Fantastic! And what do you\
  \ do for a living in Obergrumpelschwittenzollern, Horst?\nContestant : I have a\
  \ small business manufacturing cowbells.\nSmarmy Host : Fantastic! And I believe\
  \ your lovely wife and lovely children are with you here tonight, is that right?\n\
  Contestant : That's right, Brian\n[Camera shot of lovely wife and lovely children\
  \ in audience.]\nSmarmy Host\_: Well let's hope you do them proud, Horst. Are you\
  \ ready to play . . .\n[Dramatic drumroll.]\nSmarmy Host\_: . . . Guns Before Butter!?\n\
  Contestant\_: [Swallowing nervously] Yes I am, Alan.\n[Smarmy Host ushers Contestant\
  \ towards a curtain, which sweeps back to reveal two small tables. On one is a stack\
  \ of guns, on the other a packet of butter.]\nSmarmy Host\_: Okay, Horst. I'm sure\
  \ you know the rules, but let's just run through them again for the viewers at home.\
  \ There are two tables. On one is a stack of guns, and on the other is a packet\
  \ of butter. All you have to do is to choose, either the guns or the butter. You've\
  \ got that?\nContestant : Yes, I think so.\nSmarmy Host\_: Remember, guns or butter.\
  \ You can only choose one.\nContestant\_: Yes.\nSmarmy Host\_: Okay. Let's play\
  \ . . . Guns Before Butter! Horst, you have one minute, starting . . . now!\n[Big\
  \ clock starts to tock noisily. Contestant looks solemn, gazing from one table to\
  \ another.]\nSmarmy Host\_: It's your choice, Horst. Take your time. You still have\
  \ fifty seconds.\n[Contestant dithers.]\nSmarmy Host : It looks so easy when you're\
  \ watching at home, doesn't it?\nContestant\_: Phew! Yes, Ted, that's right.\nSmarmy\
  \ Host\_: Forty seconds, Horst.\n[Contestant looks as if he is about to choose,\
  \ then dithers a bit more.]\nContestant\_: There's part of me that wants to go for\
  \ the guns, but . . .\nSmarmy Host\_: Thirty seconds, Horst. Half way to the bell.\
  \ It's louder and more resonant than one of your cowbells, I expect.\nContestant\_\
  : [Chuckling] I expect so, Dax.\nSmarmy Host\_: What do you think the good folk\
  \ of Obergrumpelschwittenzollern are yelling at their television screens right now,\
  \ Horst?\nContestant\_: I wish I knew, Graham!\nSmarmy Host : Fifteen seconds.\n\
  Contestant\_: Okay, okay. I think I'm going to go for . . .[Dithers again]\nSmarmy\
  \ Host : Ten seconds.\nContestant : Um . . .\nSmarmy Host\_: Nine . . . eight .\
  \ . . seven . . .\nContestant\_: Okay! I'm going to choose butter, Bob.\nSmarmy\
  \ Host : You choose butter? Is that your final decision?\nContestant\_: Yes . .\
  \ . butter!\n[Loud, resonant bell clangs. Audience silent as the grave.]\nSmarmy\
  \ Host\_: That's your time up, Horst. You chose butter. Well I can tell you now\
  \ . . . butter was the . . . [extends pause to wring as much tension from the situation\
  \ as conceivably possible, then pauses a bit more] . . . wrong answer, Horst!\n\
  [Audience groans, then starts to hiss and boo.]\nSmarmy Host\_: I'm sorry, Horst.\
  \ The correct choice was guns, as it always is on Guns Before Butter. But you weren't\
  \ to know that. Well, actually, you were, so you must just be incredibly, incredibly\
  \ stupid.\nContestant\_: I suppose so, Rolf.\nSmarmy Host\_: You've been a great\
  \ contestant, Horst. Let's have a bloodcurdling din of hisses and boos for Horst!\n\
  [Brutes appear onstage and bustle Horst away, to face who knows what godawful fate.]\n\
  I have written to dozens of television light entertainment commissioning editors\
  \ pleading with them to revive the show, thus far without success.\nSTOP PRESS\_\
  : One of my letters might have paid off! It was apparently retrieved from a waste\
  \ paper bin by Stephen Fry on one of his regular night-time prowls around commissioning\
  \ editors\u2019 offices. He is reportedly planning a dumbed-down version of Guns\
  \ Before Butter for BBC Radio Four. Marcus Brigstocke, David Mitchell, and Alan\
  \ Titchmarsh have already been lined up as contestants.\n[2012-09-21]"
