  \ Toyah Willcox, or Mrs Fripp as we like to think of her, owns a house which is\
  \ used to store her ever-growing archive of memorabilia. Every last scrap of evidence\
  \ of Mrs Fripp's existence on earth, in all media, is contained in a sort of Uber\
  \ Toyah Silo, which, from the outside, looks just like an ordinary house. Strange,\
  \ but true.\nIt has now come to light that Dobson, the twentieth century's greatest\
  \ out of print pamphleteer, also had a building other than his residence\u2014possibly\
  \ a barn, or a chalet\u2014but we have no idea what he kept in there. Furs? Frippabilia?\
  \ It'th a mythtery, sure enough.\nI shall do some research.\n[2009-10-11]"
