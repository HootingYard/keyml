text: "As I made my way through the world, along lanes and pathways lined by larch,\
  \ laburnum, and pine, I came at last to the village of the cheesegraters. Here,\
  \ I thought, is somewhere I can lay my hat. My hat is not a cheese-hat. It will\
  \ not be grated.\nAnd it was not. But nor was it admired, as I felt sure it would\
  \ be. No villager came up to me to say \u201CCor blimey, what a splendid titfer\
  \ you've got there atop your head, meinheer!\u201D Rather, they seemed a sullen\
  \ people, jowly and hoarse, and sullen, sullen.\nIn the village square I sat, to\
  \ observe their ways. I jotted no notes in my jotting pad. It struck me, and forcibly,\
  \ forcibly, that they seemed to grate more marzipan than cheese. The air was scented\
  \ with almond. Theirs was a sullen grating.\nThere were many gratings, too, punctuating\
  \ the paving slabs of the path crisscrossing the square. Metal gratings that gleamed\
  \ in the sunlight in lattice patterns of stupendous complexity, like the most delicate\
  \ of lacework. What lay beneath those gratings?, I wondered. Drains and sewers,\
  \ drains and sewers, came the reply, whispered on the breeze.\nDo not scoff when\
  \ I suggest I was spoken to by the wind, by the stirrings of the almond-scented\
  \ air. That is how it is in the village of the cheesegraters, that sullen place,\
  \ where cheese comes cheap, and marzipan cheaper.\nIt was a tiny village, and when\
  \ I left the square I was soon enough out in open country. Now there was no wind\
  \ to speak of, or to speak to me. All was still and silent. I saw a bird in the\
  \ sky, but I know nothing of ornithology. I passed on, my splendid titfer atop my\
  \ head, towards another village.\n[2017-10-30]"
