text: 'Between 1218 and 1260, you couldn''t set foot outside your house between Peking
  and Prague without having a Mongol horde sweep past and lop your ears off while
  flaying your grandparents and eating your dog, all without dismounting. By moving
  quickly, travelling in large packs and placing important people in highly visible
  positions of authority, the Mongols created a daunting illusion of ubiquity and
  numerical superiority.

  The same situation prevails with Baby Boomers. While it may be true that tie-dyed,
  hemp-toking countercultural hipsters were never an absolute majority of Boomers,
  it certainly seemed like it at the time.
