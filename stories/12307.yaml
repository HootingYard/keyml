text: "The Rancorous Hobbledehoy is an old folk song collected by the old folk song\
  \ collector Tick Vange. He was roaming the rustic goat-strewn byways of that splat\
  \ of land between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity one day when he stopped to lean against\
  \ a fence and smoke his pipe.\nIn his memoir of old folk song collecting, Collecting\
  \ Old Folk Songs In The Vicinity Of Fort Hoity And Fort Toity\_: A Memoir, Vange\
  \ wrote:\nAs I leaned there, against a fence, puffing on my pipe crammed with a\
  \ goodly swug of moff, o'er the greensward came drifting to my ears, as if from\
  \ far far away, a haunting melody, played on a pig whistle. It was haunting in the\
  \ way one is haunted by a grisly ghoul. The hairs on the back of my neck bristled,\
  \ a shiver ran down my spine, the blood drained from my face, I trembled and I shook,\
  \ and I piddled in my stylish Italianate faux peasant trousers. What damnable tune\
  \ was this?\nThe year was 1937. It was the day after the Hindenburg Disaster, of\
  \ which Tick Vange knew nothing. His only interests were pipe tobacco and the collection\
  \ of old folk songs, and he was barely even aware of the existence of airships.\n\
  I worked on the assumption, he wrote elsewhere, that anything flying about in the\
  \ air above my head must be a bird of one sort or another. Having not a jot of interest\
  \ in ornithology, I could thus safely ignore flying things.\nAs Vange listened,\
  \ the melody grew louder and clearer, and he realised the pig whistle was accompanied\
  \ by singing. The voice was plaintive and grating, like a corncrake with a broken\
  \ heart. One meets such birds in fables, of course, but this was brute reality.\n\
  Peering over the fence into the distance, Vange saw, approaching o'er the greensward,\
  \ a pair of what he took to be peasants, the one tooting the pig whistle, the other\
  \ singing. And as they grew closer still, he was able to make out the words.\nHere\
  \ sleeps the rancorous hobbledehoy\n    On a bed of filthy straw\n    Oh do not\
  \ wake the hobbledehoy\n    Until the crow does caw\n    The crow will caw and the\
  \ pigs will snort\n    The asp will hiss and then in the fort\n    Our captains\
  \ brave will come clattering through\n    Red with the blood of the orphans they\
  \ slew\n    All but one who fled and hid\n    Oh such an ill-tempered kid\n    They\
  \ will hunt him down, they will find that boy\n    They will slay the rancorous\
  \ hobbledehoy\n\u201CI must ask these putative peasants,\u201D thought Tick Vange,\
  \ steadying himself against the fence, \u201CIf their song commemorates an episode\
  \ in local peasant history. A fort is mentioned, which may be Fort Hoity or Fort\
  \ Toity. Either fort, or indeed both, might once have witnessed a massacre of the\
  \ innocents as is alluded to in this haunting plaintive grating song.\u201D\nBut\
  \ as the tooter and the singer came ever closer, the old folk song collector saw\
  \ that, far from being local rustic persons, they were in fact the very picture\
  \ of metropolitan sophistication, dripping with pearls and dallying with impossibly\
  \ long cigarette holders. With a start, Vange recognised them as none other than\
  \ the world-famous music hall variety act Mr Peevish & His Lovely Wife Gwendolyn.\
  \ What in the name of all the saints in heaven were they doing trudging o'er the\
  \ greensward?\nTick Vange heaved himself up to his full height, a creditable six-foot-six\
  \ in his socks, and raised his arm to halt the duo. He was eager to question them\
  \ closely regarding The Rancorous Hobbledehoy. But they passed him by, without acknowledgement,\
  \ continuing on their way, tooting and singing. Vange watched them vanish into the\
  \ distance, in the direction of Fort Hoity, or possibly Fort Toity. He was uncertain\
  \ of the terrain.\nHad he had any interests other than pipe tobacco and the collection\
  \ of old folk songs, he might have read a newspaper once in a while. Had he read\
  \ that morning's edition of Daily Airship Disaster News, he would have learned that\
  \ among those who perished in the Hindenburg Disaster the day before were world-famous\
  \ music hall variety stars Mr Peevish & His Lovely Wife Gwendolyn.\n[2014-01-23]"
