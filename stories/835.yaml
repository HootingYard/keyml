text: "Bobsleigh and curling were the great enthusiasms of the winter sports enthusiast.\
  \ His enthusiasm was that of a spectator rather than a participant, his body being\
  \ too gangly and chaotic for him to accomplish even the simplest athletic technique\
  \ with any measure of success. As a youth, he had fancied himself as the sort of\
  \ person who could throw himself off a high diving board and perform breathtaking\
  \ pirouettes before plunging, straight as an arrow, into the municipal swimming\
  \ pool, but his efforts were laughable. After dozens of attempts, he saw sense,\
  \ slinking away from the pool and indeed away from the town, heading north until\
  \ he reached snow and ice, where he felt at home, and where winter sports were engaged\
  \ in all year round, and he became a fan of bobsleigh and curling, and he bought\
  \ a pair of sunglasses and a season ticket to events.\nIt was in a stadium watching\
  \ a curling quarter-final that the enthusiast met the dimwit. The dimwit was an\
  \ important figure in this cold country, having risen, as so many dimwits do, to\
  \ civic office. He had his own box in the stadium, as he had boxes in all the stadia\
  \ thereabouts, for though he knew nothing of the rules and drama of curling or of\
  \ any other sport, winter or otherwise, the dimwit liked to be seen out and about,\
  \ being important, a golden chain of office slung around his neck, and a cap upon\
  \ his head.\nThe enthusiast and the dimwit bumped into each other as they both made\
  \ for the automated snack dispenser in the lobby of the stadium. The enthusiast\
  \ recognised the dimwit, for the latter's photograph was regularly published in\
  \ newspapers and magazines and propaganda sheets, and he often appeared on television,\
  \ against a backdrop of ice-girt palaces and official buildings.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D\
  \ said the winter sports enthusiast, \u201CYou are Bogdan Vingo, the minister of\
  \ broad sweeping policy pronouncements!\u201D\n\u201CI am indeed, little gangly\
  \ chaotic person,\u201D replied the dimwit, buffing his chain with the cuff of his\
  \ coat.\nAnd so began a surprising friendship that was to last as long as they both\
  \ lived, for the winter sports enthusiast and the dimwit discovered they had much\
  \ in common, not least that, in a certain light, they could be taken for twins.\
  \ They were not twins, of course, but the resemblance was close enough to disconcert\
  \ the visually impaired citizens of that freezing land, and both used it to their\
  \ advantage, in advancing their separate schemes and plots.\nIf you were to chance\
  \ upon your Doppelg\xE4nger, you might wish it wasn't a dimwit, but needs must when\
  \ the devil drives. And the devil did drive the winter sports enthusiast, for as\
  \ he realised the opportunities for mischief and shenanigans afforded by his striking\
  \ likeness to the dimwit, he dug himself ever deeper into a pit of moral turpitude,\
  \ and by the time he was racked by remorse and wished to clamber out of it, it was\
  \ far too late.\nSource\_: The Dimwit Doppelg\xE4nger & Other Cautionary Anecdotes\
