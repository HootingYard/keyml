text: "Today's advent calendar picture may upset those of a nervous disposition and\
  \ those subject to fits of the vapours when confronted by images of lightning-struck\
  \ cows. The picture\u2014of cattle struck by lightning\u2014is a print from 1872.\n\
  Instructions for making your advent calendar can be found here. What I forgot to\
  \ mention is that, having glued the picture to your sheet of cardboard, you should\
  \ use a thick black marker pen to write the appropriate number above, below, or\
  \ to the side of the picture. Deploy Roman numerals, please.\n\n[2011-12-03]"
