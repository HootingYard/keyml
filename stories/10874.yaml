text: "\nThe sausage-and-haddock woman, writing on this day in 1918:\nLytton came\
  \ to tea; stayed to dinner, and about 10 o\u2019 clock we both had that feeling\
  \ of parched lips and used up vivacity which comes from hours of talk. But Lytton\
  \ was most easy and agreeable. Among other things he gave us an amazing account\
  \ of the British Sex Society which meets at Hampstead. [Now there's a surprise.\u2014\
  FK] They were surprisingly frank; and fifty people of both sexes and various ages\
  \ discussed without shame such questions as the deformity of Dean Swift's penis;\
  \ whether cats use the w.c.; self abuse; incest . . . I think of becoming a member.\
  \ Lytton at different points exclaimed Penis; his contribution to the openness of\
  \ the debate. We also discussed the future of the world; how we should like professions\
  \ to exist no longer; Keats, old age, politics, Bloomsbury hypnotism\u2014a great\
  \ many subjects.\n[2013-01-21]"
