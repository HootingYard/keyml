text: "In my cupboard this week, I bring to the huddled masses of Dabbler readers\
  \ Maud Pastry's recipe for alphabet soup. Within seconds of it being posted this\
  \ morning, my email inbox emitted a raucous clanging noise, audible as far away\
  \ as Timbuctoo\u2014a signal that I had received a missive from the bluestocking\
  \ soup maven herself. It reads as follows:\n\n\u201CIt is a crying shame, Mr Key,\
  \ that you did not seek my permission before letting those Dabbler people, whomsoever\
  \ they may be, reproduce my receipt for alphabet soup. Either through neglect or\
  \ mischief you omitted a crucial passage from the receipt, and I feel sorry for\
  \ any reader who prepares the soup according to the bastardised version which is\
  \ now so regrettably in the public domain. It occurred to me to issue a corrective\
  \ as a tweet on The Dabbler's Twitter feed, but on reflection I realised I do not\
  \ even know what that means, being as I am a creature very much of the previous\
  \ century, if not the one before that. I therefore insist that you air this letter\
  \ on your weblog.\n\u201CPlease note that when leaving the bowl to stand, and before\
  \ transferring the contents to a cauldron, one should introduce into the liquid\
  \ a duck, preferably a merganser or teal. The duck should be left to plash \u2018\
  n\u2019 dabble in the bowl, as if it were a pond, for at least two hours. You should\
  \ then remove the duck, gently, wearing gloves, and allow it to go on its merry\
  \ way, perhaps to rejoin its family of other ducks, wherever they may be. The soup\
  \ will contain a \u201Cmemory\u201D of the duck's presence, plashing \u2018n\u2019\
  \ dabbling, and this adds a piquancy to the flavour which, though imperceptible\
  \ on the palate, is such stuff as soups are made on, as the Swan of Avon (a man,\
  \ not a duck) might have said.\n\u201CI shall look forward to seeing this important\
  \ note appear, Mr Key. Do this in memory of me.\u201D\n[2010-12-03]"
