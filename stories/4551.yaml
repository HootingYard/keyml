text: "I have made it clear in the past that I abhor Twitter. (The Hooting Yard Twitter\
  \ feed, adverted to over in the right-hand column, consists of nought but pointers\
  \ to postages on this site, generated by some sort of het internet robot, so I need\
  \ never go near it with a bargepole.)\nOne reason to loathe Twitter is of course\
  \ the enthusiasm with which it was embraced by The Most Gigantic Brain In The Known\
  \ Universe, of whom Peter Hitchens has observed \u201CStephen Fry's voice and manner\
  \ generally make me switch off the radio\u2014that strange mixture of hair oil and\
  \ molasses, bubbling with self-satisfied giggles, is more than I can take at any\
  \ time of day\u201D. Hitchens may be bonkers, but in this case he is surely correct.\n\
  Anyway, I mention Twitter only because I came across an eerily prescient observation,\
  \ in The Tents Of Wickedness by Peter De Vries, published in 1959:\n\u201CAnd have\
  \ you noticed something else about figures with the tragic sense? They're the ones\
  \ who buck the race up. Not the twitterers.\u201D\n[2010-05-30]"
