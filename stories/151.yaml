  \ BibliOdyssey. Today the site has a particularly splendid set of Remarkable Persons:\n\
  \u201CJohn Bigg, the Dinton Hermit, baptized 22nd of April, 1629, buried 4th of\
  \ April, 1696. He lived [..] in a cave, had been a man of tolerable wealth, was\
  \ looked upon as a pretty good scholar, and of no contemptible parts. Upon the restoration\
  \ he grew melancholy, betook himself to a recluse life, and lived by charity, but\
  \ never asked for any thing but leather, which he would immediately nail to his\
  \ clothes. He kept 3 bottles that hung to his girdle, viz. for strong and small\
  \ beer, and milk; his shoes are still preserved; they are very large, and made up\
  \ of about a thousand patches of leather.\u201D\n\n[2007-05-11]"
