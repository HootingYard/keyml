text: "In correspondence with one of my correspondents the other day, the subject\
  \ of golf was raised. (There was a Herman Melville connection, with which I will\
  \ not tax you.) This led me to recall a childhood memory, and I fired off an email\
  \ as follows:\nThe only time in my life I ever played a round of golf was when I\
  \ was eight years old. I was with a friend and his Scottish grandfather. My abiding\
  \ memory of the adventure is that the grandfather whacked me on the elbow\u2014\
  hard\u2014with his golf club. He insisted it was an accident. Hmm.\nTo which my\
  \ correspondent replied:\nThanks for that piece of information\u2014I am wondering\
  \ whether the disclosure of the grandfather's nationality is a mere embellishment,\
  \ or actually a key detail of the tale.\nWithout giving the matter much, or indeed\
  \ any, thought, I replied immediately to say that I thought the detail highly significant.\
  \ I have never played golf again.\n[2014-05-21]"
