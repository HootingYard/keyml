text: "\nLars Talc was passing along the Avenue Ack, on his way to a certain scientifico-medical\
  \ club founded by a philanthropist, which he had succeeded in joining by dint of\
  \ intrigue. He knew that at noon, at the close of the meeting, each member, after\
  \ drawing lots, would be given a reconnoitering trail to follow, baited with an\
  \ interesting prize. He had last taken part in this escapade the previous month\u2014\
  stormy June\u2014and still kept, tucked in his blazer pocket, the prize he had managed\
  \ to track down over eleven excruciating days.\nThe philanthropist himself was unable\
  \ to distribute the prize trails, as he was plagued with whitlows and other complaints.\
  \ Indeed, he rarely attended the meetings any more, and when he did, he crouched\
  \ in the darkest corner of the chamber, sucking boiled sweets and tugging at his\
  \ matted hair.\nHe had assigned the job of presiding over the meetings, and handing\
  \ out the reconnoitering trails, to his assistant, Bewg. Bewg was astonishingly\
  \ tall, almost a freak, and wore a cardboard hat which he covered with cellophane\
  \ during rainstorms. Ignorant of science and medicine\u2014and of virtually everything\
  \ else\u2014he was nonetheless masterly as the club's president, for reasons which\
  \ will become apparent. What else is there to say about him for the present? His\
  \ eyes were different colours (violet and puce); he was fond of badgers; he had\
  \ once pole-vaulted for his country, and won a medal. Bear in mind that this story\
  \ is set in Finland.\nThe scientifico-medical club\u2014its exact name is unknown\u2014\
  had been established by the philanthropist twelve years ago. It met on the second\
  \ Tuesday of every month, in chambers let by a circus impresario. Usually the members\
  \ would gather in the outer room, cold and pokey and crammed with a bewildering\
  \ agglomeration of worm-eaten furniture. There were so many tables, chairs, chaises\
  \ longues, escritoires, tallboys, bureaux, umbrella-stands, reliquaries, trestles,\
  \ musnuds, pallets, brackets, hammocks, bins, easels, divans, dressers, wardrobes\
  \ and bunks in the room, all of them ready to crumble to dust, that the eleven members\
  \ of the club, haplessly wedged between cots and benches as they sipped their tumblers\
  \ of hooch, let out yelps of glee when, at last, Bewg unlatched the door of the\
  \ inner chamber and admitted them to the meeting room. This was more spacious, though\
  \ colder, and virtually empty of furnishings, save for a dozen exquisitely comfortable\
  \ armchairs, a small side-table, a display cabinet, and a lectern. Finnish timber\
  \ burned in the grate, but Bewg insisted on throwing all the windows open. The room\
  \ was cold even at the height of summer, what with certain architectural niceties,\
  \ air-draughts, and the northern climate. The members sank into their armchairs,\
  \ Bewg handed out the agenda, and the meeting began.\nLast month, Hairgrub had delivered\
  \ his paper on muskotti (nutmeg). As ever, he was puckish. When his talk was done,\
  \ his colleagues fired questions at him, raised objections, made sarcastic comments,\
  \ suggested texts for further reading, and were in the throes of a noisy discussion\
  \ when Bewg rose from his chair, armed himself with a mallet, banged a tin gong\
  \ and silenced them at a stroke. Now no one spoke except the president. In rum staccato,\
  \ Bewg rapped out the club's business: correspondence sent and received, financial\
  \ matters, topics for future papers, complaints, bile\u2014the usual concerns of\
  \ any small private club. The enormous wooden clock nailed askew above the fireplace\
  \ struck noon. The time had come to hand out the reconnoitering trails.\nBefore\
  \ passing on to this most enthralling aspect of Bewg's office, a few words should\
  \ be said about the subjects upon which the club members exercised their minds.\
  \ In its early days, when the founding philanthropist was still active, the club\
  \ had been entirely scientifico-medical in its concerns. As old members left (through\
  \ boredom, maladies, death or\u2014in one celebrated case\u2014to join a chain gang)\
  \ and were replaced with new blood, the club's character changed, slowly but surely.\
  \ Topics drawn from a wider trough would engage the members\u2019 attention. Satin,\
  \ timidity, and dust had each been the subject of a specialist paper, as had concubinage,\
  \ buttons, croup, oars, and piety. Bewg's influence should not be underestimated.\
  \ After all, he alone would suggest topics for investigation, and it is not too\
  \ much to say that the various subjects to which the club turned its attentions\
  \ were a map of the president's mental life. Occasionally, his research-by-proxy\
  \ had a more practical application. Bewg had long been embroiled in a dispute with\
  \ his landlord and\u2014far-sighted as ever\u2014decided that a knowledge of firearms\
  \ would be useful. He suggested the topic to the club on an unexpectedly hot Tuesday\
  \ in December confident that one of the members would spend months boning up on\
  \ the subject. And so it was, that at the beginning of our story, as he pranced\
  \ along the Avenue Ack, Lars Talc's brain was primed with the paper he planned to\
  \ deliver upon musketry\u2014ampumakoulutus in Finnish. Luckily, we have his notes,\
  \ and the talk he never gave can be reconstructed up to a point. Ah, but lost forever\
  \ the timbre of his voice, the chilling economy of his gestures, the sweep of his\
  \ ad lib addenda!\nI have referred to \u201Creconnoitering trails\u201D; a dry phrase,\
  \ and one that does not do justice to the fiendishly exquisite (and exquisitely\
  \ fiendish) pencilled diagrams executed on Waterbath paper and inserted in formidable\
  \ maroon envelopes upon which Bewg toiled so hard. Let us call them treasure maps,\
  \ for that is what they were. To each envelope was gummed a label upon which Bewg\
  \ had written the name of a common farmyard implement\u2014eleven in all, one for\
  \ each member of the club. The same words were inscribed on folded triangles of\
  \ custard-paper which Bewg carried in a small gunny sack. At noon, at the close\
  \ of each meeting, the members would form a line before the president in strict\
  \ alphabetical order by surname, and, in turn, pluck a triangle from the sack. This\
  \ done, the envelopes would be distributed. Each member was now in possession of\
  \ the clues which would lead them to a fascinating prize.\nLast month, having picked\
  \ kirnu (a churn) from the gunny sack, Lars Talc was given his envelope, and immediately\
  \ scurried home to open it in the privacy of his boudoir. This room, incidentally,\
  \ is worth describing in some detail, so garish were its accoutrements. But that\
  \ will have to be the subject of a separate work to do it any justice.\nOn the afternoon\
  \ of the second Tuesday in June, Lars Talc opened his envelope and unfolded a huge\
  \ sheet of Waterbath paper. Its complexities dizzied him. He had to sit down and\
  \ knock back the best part of a bottle of Ivory Coast penk before he could even\
  \ begin to examine Bewg's dastardly handiwork. It was at once a map and a manuscript,\
  \ a web and a whirligig. Talc gazed at it for hours. Oh, so futile to try to unravel\
  \ its mysteries while flopped on a Davenport!\nDraining the flask, he hurriedly\
  \ packed a valise, scribbled a note for Minnie, hailed a taxi, barged through the\
  \ crowds at the railway station, jumped the queue at the ticket office, scrambled\
  \ at the very last second on to the train leaving from platform eleven, sank panting\
  \ into a seat in the dining-car, ordered a magnificent (and typically Finnish) concoction\
  \ of poached egg, mustard, and cauliflower, let out a mighty sigh, and, patting\
  \ the maroon envelope in his pocket, looked out of the grimy window as rusted machinery,\
  \ sheds, huts, outbuildings and sad, sad tumbles of brickish ruin gave way to titanic\
  \ cedars, binsey poplars, and pollarded willows, as the locomotive took him south,\
  \ out of Finland, through Russia, Belorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, northern\
  \ Italy, and on into France, to halt at last at Marseilles, where, stopping only\
  \ to eat and drink in a sailors\u2019 tavern, he boarded the Pig Battery, a packet\
  \ steamer, foisted some banknotes into the purser's filthy hand, found his way to\
  \ a cabin, tossed his valise into the corner, lay down on his bunk, and, unscrewing\
  \ the top off another bottle of penk, drank himself into oblivion. It was now late\
  \ afternoon on Friday, just over seventy-two hours since he had opened Bewg's churn-envelope.\n\
