text: "\u201CThe dictionary ends sooner than the soul.\u201D\u2014Frederic Myers,\
  \ letter to Arthur Sidgwick, 14 July 1867.\nWhen we reach the end of the dictionary,\
  \ there are no more words. We have exhausted them. We are left, then, with three\
  \ choices.\nWe may lapse into silence. This is a strategy much favoured by anchorites\
  \ and hermits and some saints and saintly persons. I have, myself, been described\
  \ as a Diogenesian recluse, and not without good reason.\nWe may resort to barbaric\
  \ grunting. This seems to be a popular choice among many of the shuffling scowling\
  \ denizens of my bailiwick. Whenever I go sashaying forth\u2014for even a recluse\
  \ must sashay forth from time to time\u2014I hear more grunts than words. But where\
  \ once I thumbed my nose in patrician contempt at those grunters, now I understand\
  \ that they have been reduced to their barbarism because they have used up all the\
  \ words in the dictionary, from A to Z. They reached the end.\nWe may invent new\
  \ words. We may coin new sounds. Glogscheen, snup, parapapahooft, swarfoogie. Some\
  \ might say we are thus babbling nonsense. Others would counter that our nonce-words\
  \ are divinely inspired, that we are \u201Cspeaking in tongues\u201D. Once towards\
  \ the end of the last century, I sat in a hall in a meeting of the religiously devout,\
  \ several of whose members loomed over me and so spoke in tongues, to cure me of\
  \ my woes. Those woes are past, and I may doubt that incoherent babbling was the\
  \ cause of their passing, but can I ever be sure?\nThere is a fourth choice. When\
  \ we reach the end of the dictionary, we turn back to the beginning, where each\
  \ and every word awaits us anew.\n[2014-10-12]"
