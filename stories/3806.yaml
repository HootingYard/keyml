text: "\u201CThe quality is moderately hot, proper for winter or summer. The drink\
  \ is declared to be most wholesome, preserving in perfect health until extreme old\
  \ age. The particular virtues are these: It maketh the body active and lusty. It\
  \ helpeth the headache, giddiness and heaviness thereof. It removeth the obstructions\
  \ of the spleen, it is very good against the stone and gravel. It taketh away the\
  \ difficulty of breathing, opening obstructions. It is good against lippitude distillations,\
  \ and cleareth the sight. It removeth lassitude, and cleanseth and purifieth acrid\
  \ humours and a hot liver. It is good against crudities, strengthening the weakness\
  \ of the stomach, causing good appetite and digestion, and particularly for men\
  \ of corpulent body, and such as are great eaters of flesh. It vanquisheth heavy\
  \ dreams, easeth the brain, and strengtheneth the memory. It overcometh superfluous\
  \ sleep, and prevents sleepiness in general, a draught of the infusion being taken;\
  \ so that without trouble whole nights may be spent in study without hurt to the\
  \ body. It prevents and cures agues, surfeits, and fevers by infusing a fit quantity\
  \ of the leaf, thereby provoking a most gentle vomit and breathing of the pores,\
  \ and hath been given with wonderful success. It (being prepared and drunk with\
  \ milk and water) strengtheneth the inward parts and prevents consumptions. It is\
  \ good for colds, dropsies, and scurvies, and expelleth infection. And that the\
  \ virtues and excellencies of this leaf and drink are many and great is evident\
  \ and manifest by the high esteem and use of it (especially of late years) by the\
  \ physicians and knowing men of France, Italy, Holland, and other parts of Christendom,\
  \ and in England it hath been sold in the leaf for six pounds, and sometimes for\
  \ ten pounds, the pound weight; and in respect of its former scarceness and dearness,\
  \ it hath been only used as a regalia in high treatments and entertainments, and\
  \ presents made thereof to princes and grandees till the year 1657.\u201D\nFrom\
  \ a 17th century pamphlet on the subject of tea, quoted in Byegone England\_: Social\
  \ Studies In Its Historic Byways And Highways by William Andrews, (1892). He also\
  \ quotes from an Edmund Waller poem, thus: \u201CThe Muses's friend, tea does our\
  \ fancy aid / Repress those vapours which the head invade\u201D.\n[2010-01-30]"
