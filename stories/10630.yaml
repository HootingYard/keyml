text: "There was a review in today's Grauniad of a concert by a popstrel called Emeli\
  \ Sand\xE9, which included the following observation\u2026\nExcuse me a moment while\
  \ I interrupt myself. A splendid feature of The Listener, which I extolled the other\
  \ day, was that it did not concern itself with popular culture, or if it did, only\
  \ very rarely. (I think in its latter days John Peel wrote an occasional column,\
  \ but that was about as \u201Cpop\u201D as it got, i.e., not very far.) The same\
  \ was of course true of the broadsheet newspapers, until about twenty years ago.\
  \ They did not deign to notice the existence of pop pap, and would certainly never\
  \ have sent a reviewer to the 1970s equivalent of an Emeli Sand\xE9\_concert. Now,\
  \ I am not Peter Hitchens. I did not stop listening to pop and rock music at the\
  \ age of 22, and I retain a keen interest in certain corners of popular culture.\
  \ But I cannot help thinking that it was a more edifying age when coverage of young\
  \ persons\u2019 music was left to the young persons\u2019 music press, and did not\
  \ invade every cranny of the media. If, when I was a teenperson, you had told me\
  \ that the NME\u2018s Charles Shaar Murray would one day write for the Daily Telegraph,\
  \ my jaw would have dropped. As, I suspect, would Charles Shaar Murray's.\nAnyway,\
  \ back to that review. It reports that\nAlthough Sand\xE9's lyrics can be refreshingly\
  \ daft . . . many of them endlessly string together cliches and platitudes. Mountains\
  \ are moved or climbed and lovers pack suitcases\u2014although, to her credit, she\
  \ has so far managed to avoid crying in the rain.\nReading this, it occurred to\
  \ me to wonder if something similar could be said about Dobson, the titanic out\
  \ of print pamphleteer of the twentieth century. If we swap \u201CDobson\u201D for\
  \ \u201CSand\xE9\u201D, and \u201Cpamphlets\u201D for \u201Clyrics\u201D, can we\
  \ say, with even a hint of accuracy,\nAlthough Dobson's pamphlets can be refreshingly\
  \ daft . . . many of them endlessly string together cliches and platitudes. Mountains\
  \ are moved or climbed and lovers pack suitcases\u2014although, to his credit, he\
  \ has so far managed to avoid crying in the rain.\n(followed, to be grammatically\
  \ correct, by) ? Well, can we?\nThat first phrase is almost unarguable. We might\
  \ question how \u201Crefreshing\u201D the daftness is, but of the daftness itself\
  \ there can be no doubt. In his definitive categorisation of the pamphlets, the\
  \ greatest of all Dobsonists, Aloysius Nestingbird, divided the canon into Daft,\
  \ Valiant, Coruscating, Sensible, Shoddy, Hysterical, Majestic, Ornithological,\
  \ Searing, and Illegible. \u201CDaft\u201D is by far the largest group, by a long\
  \ chalk. And even if we wish to cavil with the scholar, we have Dobson's own judgement.\
  \ In Things To Shove Through A Funnel Into A Jar (out of print), he wrote, in an\
  \ aside,\nSome say many, if not most, of my pamphlets are daft. They may well be\
  \ right. Who am I to argue? But just because I do not argue, and indeed largely\
  \ accept the view, that does not mean it does not cause me untold grief. Only the\
  \ other day, for example, as I trudged along the towpath of the filthy old canal\
  \ on my way to the newsagent's, I recalled that James Cake, in a review of one of\
  \ my pamphlets, described it as \u2018\u201Dirredeemably daft\u201D, and my heart\
  \ burst with misery and I began to sob. So copious were my tears that my vision\
  \ was occluded. I was so overcome with dejection that I had to sprawl on a canalside\
  \ bench until the weeping subsided. It was pouring with rain.\nThis is an interesting\
  \ passage, in that it plainly shows the pamphleteer crying in the rain. It is not,\
  \ then, something he has \u201Cmanaged to avoid\u201D. But what about mountains\
  \ being moved, mountains being climbed, and lovers packing suitcases? Can we find\
  \ instances of these, dotted here and there, in the collected works? As Barack Obama\
  \ used to say, so mystifyingly, \u201CYes we can!\u201D Indeed, we can find so many\
  \ instances that, extracted from their sources and cobbled together into a separate\
  \ text, the passages would form a huge fat book rather than a mere pamphlet.\nDobson\
  \ is forever prattling on about mountains, in spite of the fact that as far as we\
  \ know he never actually climbed one, nor indeed lived anywhere near one. And he\
  \ certainly never moved one, though if pamphlets such as A Few Tips On Mountain-Moving,\
  \ With Shovel And Bucket (out of print) are to be believed, it was something he\
  \ busied himself with every Thursday afternoon during the 1960s. We must be grateful,\
  \ again, to Aloysius Nestingbird, who demonstrates conclusively that Dobson was\
  \ either hallucinating or lying.\nAs for lovers and their packed suitcases, the\
  \ pamphleteer does not seem as preoccupied with them as he is with mountains, but\
  \ one must not overlook his curious pamphlet A Searing, Coruscating Analysis Of\
  \ Paul Simon's Song \u201C50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\u201D, With Particular Attention\
  \ Paid To 50 Different Techniques Of Suitcase-Packing, Each Illustrated With Instructive\
  \ Diagrams With Pointy Arrows And Diagonal Lines (out of print). The pamphlet is\
  \ curious in that it is one of the few occasions when Dobson turned his attention\
  \ to popular culture. The story goes that he was sitting on a canalside bench, weeping\u2014\
  this was a different bench/weeping incident to the one alluded to above\u2014when\
  \ he was joined by a passer-by, a hairy young man who took pity on the aged pamphleteer\
  \ and gave him a somewhat grubby napkin with which to wipe away his tears. They\
  \ fell into conversation, during which the young man babbled excitedly about rock\
  \ and pop music, of which Dobson knew nothing. He was intrigued, however, and accepted\
  \ the young man's gift of a cassette tape containing the Paul Simon song, to which\
  \ he then listened when he got home.\nDiligent research has recently revealed that\
  \ the young man was present-day Daily Telegraph music writer Charles Shaar Murray.\
  \ Murray has always denied meeting Dobson, and shudders at the mention of his name.\
  \ Mind you, the same could be said for lots of people. Do not forget that the pamphleteer\
  \ was a very \u201Cdifficult\u201D man.\n[2012-11-14]"
