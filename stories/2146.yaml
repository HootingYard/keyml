text: "Yesterday I posted an extract from The Devil's Party\_: A History Of Charlatan\
  \ Messiahs by Colin Wilson. Wilson is quite a maddening writer, slapdash and hurried,\
  \ but I have to admire the way he litters his text with marvellously entertaining\
  \ snippets of information. On page 73, for example, we learn that Jim Jones of the\
  \ People's Temple funded his early cult-building efforts by being a door-to-door\
  \ monkey salesman.\n[2009-03-29]"
