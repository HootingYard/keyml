text: "Sabine Baring-Gould Week continues with some extremely useful information imparted\
  \ in his book Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), written when our hero was living\
  \ in the abundant mud of Dalton i't Muck. Examining legal proceedings taken against\
  \ \u201Csnails, flies, mice, moles, ants, caterpillars, &c.\u201D, Baring-Gould\
  \ gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate such\
  \ vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew de Chasseneux, \u201Ca noted\
  \ lawyer of the sixteenth century\u201D. Please note that you should always bring\
  \ your case against creepy-crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical rather\
  \ than the civil courts.\nThe correct form of excommunication is as follows: \u201C\
  O snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures, which destroy the food of our\
  \ neighbours, depart hence! Leave these cantons which you are devastating, and take\
  \ refuge in those localities where you can injure no one. I.N.P., &c.\u201D\nIt\
  \ is unclear to me whether that \u201C&c.\u201D indicates simply the reading of\
  \ the Lord's Prayer\u2014\u201CI.N.P.\u201D standing for \u201CIn Nomine Patris\u201D\
  \u2014or whether there are further animadversions and anathemas to follow. In the\
  \ absence of any clear guidance I suppose you shall have to get the presiding excommunicator\
  \ to improvise.\n[2010-12-08]"
