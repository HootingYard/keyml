  \ men carrying knives \u2018in self-defence\u2019 who will, however, pull it as\
  \ soon as they imagine a confrontation is in the air. They would be far better to\
  \ carry expandable batons, and far less likely to accidentally kill someone. They\
  \ would do even better to stay at home reading Sir Philip Sidney.\nPersonally, I\
  \ would recommend The Anatomy Of Melancholy, but just staying indoors, reading improving\
  \ literature, seems to me a splendid idea.\n[2008-08-15]"
