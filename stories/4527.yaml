text: "Babbling prose into a microphone for half an hour every week is all very well,\
  \ but occasionally one feels impelled to vent in a less\u2026 shall we say, prosaic\
  \ manner. To this end, I am very pleased (I think) to be taking part in a performance\
  \ by Phil Minton's Feral Choir this coming Saturday, 29th May.\nTune in to ResonanceFM\
  \ at 8.00 PM, and\u2014as Charles Ives recommended\u2014\u201Csit down, pin back\
  \ your ears, and listen like a man!\u201D (Women are equally adept at this practice.)\n\
  Incidentally, and quite coincidentally, both Phil Minton and I have contributions\
  \ due to appear in a forthcoming recipe book, to be sold for charity. I am not joking.\
  \ I will of course keep readers fully informed, so you can buy innumerable copies\
  \ when this invaluable tome hits the boulevards.\n[2010-05-26]"
