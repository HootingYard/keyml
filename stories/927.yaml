text: "One of the combat sports which thrilled the crowds in the circuses of Ancient\
  \ Rome was the pitting of blind men against ostriches. A savage and ugly spectacle,\
  \ no doubt, and one quite out of keeping with our modern sensibilities, to say nothing\
  \ of health and safety legislation. Yet I can't help feeling that it would make\
  \ a tremendous subject for a Gladiator-style movie blockbuster. The Antipodean player\
  \ Russell Crowe\u2014or, as I prefer to think of him, the Artist Formerly Known\
  \ As Bouffanted Rockabilly Star Russ Le Roq\u2014is so talented an actor one can\
  \ imagine him playing either a blind man or, caked in prosthetics, an ostrich. What\
  \ with the computer generated wizardry available to today's film-makers, he could\
  \ appear on our screens as both antagonists, and indeed, his image multiplied a\
  \ thousandfold, as the baying blood-crazed crowd.\nI may put my mind to drafting\
  \ a screenplay, in which our hero is, let's say, an Ancient Roman haruspex who is\
  \ blinded when a struggling chicken whose entrails he is attempting to rip out pokes\
  \ its taloned feet into his eyes. From there it is a short and sorry journey to\
  \ the Colosseum, where an enraged and starving ostrich awaits. It strikes me that,\
  \ if there is a need to do the film on the cheap, a high-tech ostrich outfit could\
  \ be dispensed with. Russell Crowe is, famously, a knitting enthusiast, and given\
  \ the right wool he could knit his own ostrich costume.\nAdd a musical soundtrack\
  \ of bumptious ditties by Randy Newman, and I suspect this could be a surefire hit.\n\
