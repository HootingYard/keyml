text: "\nOne of the more curious episodes in the life of the out of print pamphleteer\
  \ Dobson is recounted in his autobiographical pamphlet 17 Years In An Alpine Mist\
  \ (out of print). It begins as follows:\nOne day in the 1950s I was hiking in the\
  \ Alps, researching all things goaty for a pamphlet I planned to write, provisionally\
  \ entitled All Things Goaty In The Alps. All of a sudden I found myself engulfed\
  \ in an Alpine mist. It was thick and swirling, the sort of mist one might find\
  \ enswathing the three witches in a production of Macbeth, or in a film by Guy Maddin.\
  \ Unable to see ahead of me, I blundered about, hopelessly lost.\nI had my Alpenstock,\
  \ and a flask of vitamin-enhanced boiled buttercup \u2018n\u2019 watercress water.\
  \ Treading carefully, I tried to make my way down from the mountains. But no matter\
  \ which way I turned, I seemed always to be going uphill, up, up, and up. The mist\
  \ grew thicker and swirlier.\nIn prose that grows increasingly hysterical, even\
  \ hallucinatory, the pamphleteer reports that several hours pass, with him plodding\
  \ ever higher into the Alps. He can barely see more than an inch or two in front\
  \ of him, so dense is the Alpine mist. Eventually, he comes to a halt when his path\
  \ is blocked by a doorway.\nThe door was wooden, mahogany by the looks of it, and\
  \ set within a base and brickish wall. I could see very little of the latter, in\
  \ the thick and swirling Alpine mist, so I had no idea how high it was, nor how\
  \ far it extended on either side. Nonetheless, I gained the distinct impression\
  \ that I was standing outside a sort of half-size replica of the Winnipeg evaporated\
  \ milk factory where, long long ago, I had worked as a junior janitor. This was\
  \ most perplexing.\nDobson takes a glug from his flask, and then thumps his Alpenstock\
  \ on the door, thrice. As if in a scene from a Hammer horror film, the door slowly\
  \ opens, with an eerie and ominous creak. The pamphleteer steps inside, and is disconcerted\
  \ to note that the mist is even thicker, though a bit less swirly. The door, of\
  \ course, swings shut behind him, as in one of those films.\nMy bafflement that\
  \ the indoor mist was even more engulfing than the mist outside was leavened somewhat\
  \ by the fact that, after hours toiling uphill, the stone floor beneath my feet\
  \ was level. But I was still lost, in silence and invisibility. And then, ahead\
  \ of me, I saw emerging from the mist, a human, or semihuman, or inhuman figure.\
  \ Though it was blurry and weirdly shimmering, I sensed that it was ancient, aeons-old,\
  \ older perhaps than time itself. I did not yet realise that I had come face to\
  \ face with a Blavatskyite Being Of Unutterable Esoteric Wisdom.\nThe mysterious\
  \ figure beckons Dobson to follow him\u2014her? it?\u2014and leads the pamphleteer\
  \ to a room within a room within a room within a room within a room within a room,\
  \ an inner inner inner et cetera sanctum, still enshrouded in thick Alpine mist.\
  \ In the centre of the room stands a stone slab, an altar, upon which are carved\
  \ inscriptions in several different unknown alphabets. Otherwise, the room is bare,\
  \ save for an escritoire, an armoire, an arras, a sideboard on which stands a cassette\
  \ player and a pile of cassette tapes, a much-becushioned sofa bed, a pair of matching\
  \ musnuds, a two-bar electric fire, a treadmill, a Toc H lamp, a Bakelite figurine\
  \ of Charles W. Leadbeater, a second stone slab altar without inscriptions, an empotted\
  \ pugton tree, several vases and basins, a jelly-making kit, a mysterious blue carton,\
  \ a chemical toilet, a grandfather clock, a drumkit, an easel, a taxidermised weasel,\
  \ a waste paper bin, an espresso machine, a doormat, a rug, a cat-litter tray, and\
  \ a few other bittybobs. In one corner there is a mop and a pail.\nThis was to be\
  \ my home for the next seventeen years. In all that time, the Alpine mist never\
  \ dispersed. It remained thick, and occasionally quite swirlyish. So, when I sat\
  \ in one of the musnuds, I could not see the other one, nor any of the other appurtenances.\
  \ Moving about my sanctum, I kept bumping into things. My shins were a mass of bruises.\n\
  I learned to operate the cassette player, and grew fond of the music recorded on\
  \ the tapes. Each of them contained ninety minutes of skiffle, performed by Emile\
  \ \u2018Stalebread\u2019 Lacoume & His Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band. I also learned to\
  \ make jelly.\nOnce a week, I received a visit from the Blavatskyite Being. It explained\
  \ that it was going to initiate me into the secrets of the cosmos. To do so, it\
  \ would read a few paragraphs from The Collected Witterings of Madame Blavatsky,\
  \ and then quiz me on what I had heard. The questions were put in multiple-choice\
  \ format, which I found helpful. It had a curious speaking voice, sometimes sounding\
  \ exactly like the star of stage and screen Jack Hulbert, and at other times like\
  \ his wife and musical comedy partner Cicely Courtneidge. It might yoyo between\
  \ the two voices within a single sentence.\nEvery year, on St Bibblybibdib's Day,\
  \ it took me to its own domain, even higher in the Alps. Up there, the air was so\
  \ thin it could not form a mist, and we had to wear oxygen masks to breathe. All\
  \ day long we played ping pong on its full-size ping pong table. Oddly, every single\
  \ game we played over those seventeen years ended in a draw, which is technically\
  \ impossible when playing ping pong in the mortal world. I hoped one day to find\
  \ an explanation for this in one of the Madame Blavatsky readings, but it remained\
  \ a mystery. As did the blue carton in my sanctum, which I was forbidden to open.\n\
  Dobson notes that he marked the passage of time, at first by cutting notches in\
  \ his Alpenstock and later by ticking off the days in an Esoteric Reader's Digest\
  \ 17-Year Pocket Diary which he found in the sideboard. Then, one Thursday, the\
  \ Blavatskyite Being makes an unscheduled appearance. The mist is thicker and swirlier\
  \ than usual. The pamphleteer is told that he has learned all there is to know,\
  \ plus a bit more, and is now an Adept Of The Secret Order Of Alpine Blavatskyite\
  \ Beings (Cadet Class). It is time for him to leave, and to return to the mundane\
  \ world of mortal men. He is bundled out of his inner inner inner etcetera sanctum\
  \ none too gently, and given a shove, and skitters down the mountain, through the\
  \ mist, down and down, until of a sudden the mist clears, and he can see clearly,\
  \ and to his astonishment, there, sitting on an Alpine municipal bench at the foot\
  \ of the mountain, waiting for him, is his inamorata and poppet, Marigold Chew.\n\
  \u201CMarigold my dearest darling dear!\u201D I cried, \u201CI have returned! I\
  \ am agog to know what has been going on in the world these past seventeen years.\
  \ Did the Vietnam War escalate after the Battle of \u0110i\u1EC7n Bi\xEAn Ph\u1EE7\
  ? Did the Busby Babes win the European Cup? Was it ever proven that Alger Hiss was\
  \ indeed a Communist spy? Did Emile \u2018Stalebread\u2019 Lacoume & His Razzy Dazzy\
  \ Spasm Band top the hit parade? Uncle Joe Stalin\u2014does he yet live? Are Jack\
  \ Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge still high-earning stars in the musical comedy\
  \ firmament? Has Vice President Nixon published his book Six Crises? I have a million\
  \ questions to which answers are not vouchsafed even by the secret knowledge I have\
  \ acquired high, high in the Alpine mist!\u201D\nMarigold Chew looks at Dobson as\
  \ if he has gone mad.\n\u201CWhat on earth are you blathering on about, Dobson?\u201D\
  \ she says, \u201CYou vanished into the mist saying you were going to research all\
  \ things goaty, and here you are back again, ten minutes later. You can't have learned\
  \ much about Alpine goats in that time. And what is that lump on your head? It looks\
  \ very much as if you have been struck on the bonce by a very large pebble hurled\
  \ by a mischievous and miscreant young Alpine goatherd boy from the nearby orphanage.\
  \ We must make a complaint to the beadle to ensure the ne'er-do-well mite is given\
  \ no jelly for his pudding tonight.\u201D\nAnd with that, Marigold Chew takes Dobson\
  \ by the arm, and they walk away from the Alps, never to return in this lifetime.\n\
  NOTA BENE\_: Thanks to my old mucker Max D\xE9charn\xE9 for alerting me to the existence\
  \ of Emile \u2018Stalebread\u2019 Lacoume & His Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band, here.\n\
  ANOTHER NOTA BENE\_: Max has kindly provided a snap of the Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band,\
  \ taken in 1896 or 1897. As he says, they were proper New Orleans street urchins.\n\
