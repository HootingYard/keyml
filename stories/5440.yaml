text: "\u201CSome years since, observes a correspondent of the Athenaeum, a gentleman\
  \ at a dinner table happened to mention that he was surprised, on the death of a\
  \ relative, by his servant inquiring \u2018whether his master would inform the bees\
  \ of the event, or whether he should do so\u2019. On asking the meaning of so strange\
  \ a question, the servant assured him that bees ought always to be informed of a\
  \ death in the family, or they would resent the neglect by deserting the hive. One\
  \ of the party present took the opportunity of testing the prevalence of this strange\
  \ notion, by inquiring of a cottager who had lately lost a relative, and happened\
  \ to complain of the loss of her bees, \u2018whether she had told them all she ought\
  \ to do?\u2019 She immediately replied, \u2018Oh yes\_: when my aunt died I told\
  \ every skep [hive] myself, and put them into mourning\u2019.\u201D\nJohn Brand,\
