text: "Let me make it abundantly clear, before I say anything else, that I know nothing\
  \ of the higher mathematics. I am not proud of this, but it must be admitted. My\
  \ pea-sized yet pulsating brain may be crammed with a huge amount of learning, but\
  \ it contains much bigger pockets of profound ignorance. Among these are the higher\
  \ mathematics, and indeed much of the lower mathematics, and even quite basic physics.\n\
  When I was doing my O Levels I suggested to my physics teacher, Mr Giblin\u2014\
  a name merely an O away from Goblin\u2014that entering me for the exam was a fool's\
  \ errand, and would only waste my time and the time of the poor drudge who had to\
  \ mark my paper. Mr Giblin, however, refused to listen to my pleas, and insisted\
  \ he had every confidence in me. So it was that I turned up for the exam and read\
  \ through the six questions, of which I was expected to tackle four. Then I reread\
  \ them, hoping a glimmer of understanding might spark in my brain. My fellow examinees\
  \ were already scribbling away, brows furrowed, tongues hanging out in concentration.\
  \ I read through the questions for a third time and realised that, far from having\
  \ a clue regarding the answers, I had absolutely no understanding of what was being\
  \ asked of me. It was all a deep and perplexing mystery, as if I were trying to\
  \ read Hungarian or Finnish. I cannot remember what, if anything, I wrote on my\
  \ paper, but I felt fully vindicated when the grade I received was not even an \u201C\
  F\u201D, but \u201CUnclassified\u201D. \u201CI told you so!\u201D I crowed to Mr\
  \ Giblin, who looked at me with genuine disappointment and expressed the view that\
  \ I had probably just had a bad day. It is true that I had not slept well the night\
  \ before, having been kept awake by the most violent thunderstorm I had ever experienced.\n\
  Thus ended my formal scientific education. I have, from time to time, sought to\
  \ better myself in this regard, and once spent about six months doggedly reading\
  \ the New Scientist every week. But the pockets of ignorance remain almost wholly\
  \ empty, I'm afraid.\nHowever, this did not deter me from devising string theory.\
  \ Or perhaps I should say a string theory. When first I came across this phrase\
  \ it occurred to me that a theory about string was something I could tackle, if\
  \ I devoted myself to it. Who knows, I might flabbergast the world of science. I\
  \ was by this time no longer in contact with Mr Giblin, of course, but I hoped that\
  \ he would learn of my fantastic theory in some journal or other and feel a little\
  \ pang of satisfaction that he had been right all along. Young Mr Key did understand\
  \ physics! It was that thunderstorm that was to blame for his abject performance\
  \ in the exam, not pure ignorance! Though this was contrary to what I knew to be\
  \ the truth, I felt benevolent towards Mr Giblin, and happy to be of comfort to\
  \ him in his advancing years.\nFirst, though, I had to have a theory with which\
  \ to stun the world. And before I could come up with a theory, I needed some string.\
  \ So I went to an ironmongery and bought a ball of string. I could have obtained\
  \ some from a stationery shop, but I felt that ironmonger's string was somehow more\
  \ appropriate for my purposes. It was more technical string. That may or may not\
  \ be the case, but it was my view at the time, and I went with my instinct.\nI removed\
  \ the little blue paper band from around the ball, and slowly let it unravel, holding\
  \ one end between my thumb and forefinger while I wandered, in an aimless hypnagogic\
  \ haze, around the house. Soon enough there was a terrifically long piece of string\
  \ trailing all over the floor and across the furniture. I let go the end I had been\
  \ clutching, let it drop, and contemplated the result. What I was hoping was that\
  \ a theory would immediately begin to form in my brain, a theory about this string,\
  \ which I could write down, as it developed and took shape. Then I could type it\
  \ up, from my scribblings, pop it in an envelope, and send it off to a respected\
  \ scientific journal. Plaudits would be showered upon me, and I might even be given\
  \ a medal.\nUnfortunately, as I stood there staring at the string, my brain was\
  \ in a similar state to when I had gazed uncomprehendingly at my physics O Level\
  \ paper all those years ago. No theory whatsoever sprang into my mind, not even\
  \ a first fugitive flickering of a theory. I spat into the fireplace and painstakingly\
  \ gathered up the string, rolling it back into a ball, which I then placed on the\
  \ mantelpiece, next to a vase of poinsettias. I reflected bitterly that I had a\
  \ superb and cogent poinsettia theory, and went to take a nap.\nWhen I awoke, the\
  \ string was exactly where I had left it. On closer inspection, I was able to ascertain\
  \ that not only had it remained immobile, but it had neither unravelled itself nor\
  \ tied itself in knots. I felt the first stirrings of something in my head. Perhaps\
  \ not yet a theory, not even an idea, but some faint, stringy, intangible, stringy,\
  \ amorphous, stringy, stringy, stringy, something. However vague it was, whatever\
  \ it was, it was potent. For a time it was if there was nothing in the entire boundless\
  \ universe but my brain and a ball of string. I popped it into my pocket and went\
  \ out to trudge along the towpath of the old canal in the rain. I could not yet\
  \ put into words what I had experienced, but they would come, they would come.\n\
  That was several years ago now, and the words are still coming. They have not actually\
  \ arrived, and I struggle to form any coherent thoughts about my string theory,\
  \ but it is only a matter of time. I have the paper, the envelope, and the postage\
  \ stamp ready and waiting. And one day I shall astonish the world.\n[2012-08-07]"
