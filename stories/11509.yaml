text: "On Friday afternoon the Coroner and a respectable Jury sat on the body of a\
  \ Lady in the neighbourhood of Holborn, who died in consequence of a wound from\
  \ her daughter the preceding day. It appeared by the evidence adduced, that while\
  \ the family were preparing for dinner, the young lady seized a case knife laying\
  \ on the table, and in a menacing manner pursued a little girl, her apprentice,\
  \ round the room; on the eager calls of her helpless infirm mother to forbear, she\
  \ renounced her first object, and with loud shrieks approached her parent.\nThe\
  \ child by her cries quickly brought up the landlord of the house, but too late\u2014\
  the dreadful scene presented to him the mother lifeless, pierced to the heart, on\
  \ a chair, her daughter yet wildly standing over her with the fatal knife, and the\
  \ venerable old man, her father, weeping by her side, himself bleeding at the forehead\
  \ from the effects of a severe blow he received from one of the forks she had been\
  \ madly hurling around the room.\nFor a few days prior to this the family had observed\
  \ some symptoms of insanity in her, which had so much increased on the Wednesday\
  \ evening, that her brother early the next morning went in quest of Dr Pitcairn\u2014\
  had that gentleman been met with, the fatal catastrophe had, in all probability,\
  \ been prevented.\nIt seems the young Lady had been once before, in her earlier\
  \ years, deranged, from the harassing fatigues of too much business.\u2014As her\
  \ carriage towards her mother was ever affectionate in the extreme, it is believed\
  \ that to the increased attentiveness, which her parents\u2019 infirmities called\
  \ for by day and night, is to be attributed the present insanity of this ill-fated\
  \ young woman.\nThe above unfortunate young person is a Miss Lamb, a mantua-maker,\
  \ in Little Queen-Street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. She has been, since, removed to\
  \ Islington mad-house.\nThe Jury of course brought in their verdict, Lunacy.\n\n\
