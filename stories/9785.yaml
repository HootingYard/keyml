text: "We can go over now to our reporter on the ground, Praxiteles Hubbard . . .\
  \ \_Prax, what is the situation there on the ground?\nWell, Ulf, what the people\
  \ on the ground here are telling me is that the situation is very fluid. That's\
  \ something you might expect of the sea, rather than the ground, but there it is.\
  \ What I've been able to see here on the ground is soil, some mud, a certain amount\
  \ of silt, sparse bits of lawn, sand, then large swathes of scrubland covered in\
  \ gorse and bracken and nettles until you come into more built-up areas, where you'll\
  \ find grit and gravel and then great big paving slabs and flagstones, asphalt and\
  \ tarmac and concrete. Also on the ground is a teeming myriad of insect life, tiny\
  \ little ants and beetles, and all sorts of things that creep and slither and scuttle.\
  \ You have to be very careful not to crush them underfoot. Obviously my boots are\
  \ here on the ground, too, for the time being. Apart from in the very muddy parts\
  \ where there has been heavy rainfall, it's pretty solid, despite the situation\
  \ being fluid, as I pointed out. Gradients vary. Parts of the ground are flat but\
  \ then there are steeper bits, and in the urban areas you will find steps and stairs.\
  \ I have yet to come upon any quicksand, but what people on the ground here are\
  \ telling me is that there are patches of it, so one has to tread carefully.\nAnd\
  \ what are the people on the ground saying about the situation?\nIt depends who\
  \ you speak to, Ulf, and whereabouts on the ground they are. Earlier I was on the\
  \ ground just south of here, on an outcrop of limestone. There, I was told, the\
  \ situation was very much what you'd expect, a real sense of limestone, no sign\
  \ of quicksand, and certainly no paving slabs or flagstones. But come further north,\
  \ travelling across scrub and moorland, and you can find yourself in marshland,\
  \ which is barely ground at all. In fact it's sopping wet, as I found out to my\
  \ cost. Luckily I have a pair of wellington boots. What the people on the ground\
  \ there told me is that it has always been marshy and boggy, so the situation is\
  \ always fluid. And it gets even more fluid during the rainy season, if you can\
  \ believe that. There's a great deal of anxiety among the people on the ground,\
  \ looking up for signs of clouds.\nBut clouds are in the sky, not on the ground,\
  \ is that right, Prax?\nThat is absolutely right, Ulf. As a person on the ground\
  \ here told me earlier, the sky is not the ground. But, interestingly, just as the\
  \ ground is scattered with that teeming myriad of life-forms I was telling you about,\
  \ so is the sky. It's just that the life-forms tend to be different, things with\
  \ wings, for example, and as well as tiny insects you get birds, some of which can\
  \ be huge in comparison.\nWe know about the people on the ground, but are there\
  \ people in the sky too?\nYes there are. Most of them tend to be in aeroplanes or\
  \ helicopters, but you occasionally find a so-called bird-man, a chap with a pair\
  \ of balsa wood wings attached by a kind of harness, flinging himself off a clifftop\
  \ or promontory. What's interesting is that they tend to become people on the ground\
  \ pretty quickly, usually within minutes. There is one faction among the people\
  \ on the ground who claim there are other people in the sky, what we might call\
  \ ethereal beings, or angels, also with wings, but not balsa wood ones. They seem\
  \ to have their wings already attached, and don't need harnesses. They can also\
  \ remain airborne, so I suppose we could say they really are people in the sky,\
  \ unlike the bird-men.\nAnd have you managed to talk to any of these people in the\
  \ sky, Prax?\nNot yet, Ulf, though I have been putting out feelers.\nFeelers? Like\
  \ the tendrils and antennae of certain insects and plant-forms?\nThat's right, Ulf.\
  \ I've been putting out my feelers trying to arrange to talk to representatives\
  \ of the sky-people. They of course will have a different perspective to the people\
  \ on the ground, and it will be interesting to find out what they make of the situation,\
  \ whether they also think it is fluid. Much depends, I think, on whether it rains.\n\
  This rain, Prax, I understand it begins in the sky and comes down to the ground?\n\
  Not exactly. It actually begins in the sea, goes up into the sky, and then it comes\
  \ down to the ground.\nWhat are the people on the ground saying about that?\nWell,\
  \ again it depends very much on who you talk to. Some people put their collars up\
  \ and unfurl umbrellas and say things like \u201CMustn't grumble\u201D. Others slosh\
  \ about in puddles and they do grumble. And I've spoken with a few people here on\
  \ the ground who dance strange jigs hoping to attract the rain.\nWere they the people\
  \ on the limestone outcrop?\nNo, Ulf, they weren't. I think it's important to note\
  \ that there are all sorts of different people on the ground, depending on what\
  \ patch of ground you're talking about.\nI'll have to cut you short there, Prax,\
  \ but before you go, you've told us about the people on the ground and the people\
  \ in the sky, but are there any people under the ground?\nThere are. Some of them\
  \ are miners or pot-holers, some are international women of mystery like Primrose\
  \ Dent in her sinister subterranean HQ, and some are weird blind albino troglodyte\
  \ beings who are really rather frightening.\nFascinating stuff. That was Praxiteles\
  \ Hubbard there, our reporter on the ground. [Pause] To Jaywick now, where cows\
  \ have wandered down the main street in the early morning dawn . . .\n[2012-08-01]"
