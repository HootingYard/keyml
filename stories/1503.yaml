text: "When you go to a s\xE9ance, it is highly likely that at some point jets of\
  \ ectoplasmic goo will spurt around the room, and startle you. It is important in\
  \ these circumstances to maintain your insouciance. Instead of waving your arms\
  \ around and shrieking, go and lean against the mantelpiece and regard the scene\
  \ with an air of amused nonchalance, as if you are an actor in a 1930s drawing-room\
  \ comedy. If you smoke a pipe, this is the perfect time to light it. The ectoplasmic\
  \ goo will soon disperse, or even vanish entirely, and your fellow s\xE9ancees,\
  \ cowering and trembling, will be mightily impressed by your unruffled elegance.\
  \ Then, as they recover their wits with an air of embarrassment, you may intone\
  \ a litany of awful dread in a booming voice from beyond the grave, expose the horns\
  \ upon your head hidden until now by your bouffant, snap your fingers, and consign\
  \ your chums to the fiery flaming pit.\n\nThanks to David Thomson for the picture.\n\
