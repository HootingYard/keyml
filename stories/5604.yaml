text: "1. Now there dwelt in Gath a moptop whose name was Ringo. And one day the Lord\
  \ appeared to Ringo and he was sore affrighted. Ringo tugged at the fringe of his\
  \ moptop so it might cover his eyes that he could hide the Lord from his sight.\n\
  2. \u201CBe not afeared, moptop!\u201D boomed the Lord, for the Lord always spake\
  \ in a boom when He appeared in Gath.\n3. And Ringo, who carried a stick in each\
  \ hand with which he thumped animal hides, had dropped his sticks when tugging at\
  \ his hair.\n4. \u201CPick up thy sticks!\u201D commanded the Lord, and Ringo did\
  \ so.\n5. \u201CWhat dost thou want with me, Lord?\u201D wailed Ringo. He was an\
  \ hairy moptop with many rings on his fingers and an innate sense of rhythm.\n6.\
  \ \u201CThou shalt hie thee hence to Pisgah,\u201D boomed the Lord, \u201CAnd thou\
  \ shalt climb to the top of the mountain and thou shalt thump thy sticks there,\
  \ upon the hides of bison and salamander, stretched upon a frame, and thump them\
  \ too upon discs of metal, and make a din.\u201D\n7. And the Lord made mysterious\
  \ manoeuvres with his hands and blessed Ringo the moptop, and then He vanished in\
  \ a cloud of vaporousness, and all was still, and Ringo was alone in Gath.\n8. And\
  \ Ringo betook himself with great haste to the main railway terminus in Gath where\
  \ he might catch a train to take him all the way to Pisgah.\n9. Now at the railway\
  \ terminus there was a satrap of exceeding girth, and Ringo spake unto him, saying,\
  \ \u201CI am sent to Pisgah by the Lord, but I know not how I might journey thence\
  \ from here.\u201D\n10. And the satrap led Ringo to a tank engine and commanded\
  \ him in a voice of great pomp to step aboard. The engine was blue, the blue of\
  \ heaven.\n11. And with chugs and wheezes the tank engine with the moptop aboard\
  \ set off along the branch line to Pisgah.\n12. But lo! unbeknownst to Ringo the\
  \ satrap of exceeding girth had so arranged things that the engine was shunted into\
  \ sidings half way between Gath and Pisgah, and there it sat, and would not move.\n\
  13. And thus did Ringo the moptop find himself marooned and far from Pisgah, and\
  \ from the mountain top, and his two sticks dangled from his beringed fingers with\
  \ nought to thump, and he wept.\n[2010-11-23]"
