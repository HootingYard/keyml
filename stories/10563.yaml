text: "\nThere will be much soul-searching among US Republicans as they seek to account\
  \ for their defeat in the presidential election. A variety of factors will be blamed,\
  \ a variety of prescriptions for future strategy put forward. They could save themselves\
  \ much time and much agonising by paying heed to Hooting Yard. The reason Mitt Romney\
  \ lost is clear. As with so many things, oh! so many, there is a simple ornithological\
  \ explanation.\nReaders will probably be aware that hot on the heels of the US election,\
  \ the Chinese too are ushering in their new leadership. As is the way with people's\
  \ republics, the people themselves have absolutely no say in the matter. The Chinese\
  \ government is appointed, every ten years, by the all-powerful Party. As communists,\
  \ the Party bigwigs clearly know what is best for the little people, hence the absence\
  \ of such bourgeois twaddle as voting booths and ballot boxes.\nAs part of this\
  \ authoritarian approach, the Party is keen to ensure the people do not get any\
  \ funny ideas about possible alternatives. Thus the BBC Today programme this morning\
  \ reported that an instruction has been issued nationwide. All Chinese pigeons are\
  \ to be kept encaged until the end of the Party Congress, to foil the possibility\
  \ of pigeons being used to carry propaganda leaflets from place to place, thus stirring\
  \ unrest.\nNow, we know the Asiatic peoples are extremely fond of their birds and\
  \ poultry, and it is undoubtedly the case that the domestic pet pigeon population\
  \ of China is far, far greater than its United States equivalent. Nevertheless,\
  \ we should not discount the tremendous power of propaganda in the form of a leaflet\
  \ tied to the leg of a pigeon swooping down from the sky. Which of us would be immune\
  \ to the message borne to us by so spectacular an agency? Television, the press,\
  \ Het Internet, the mass media in general may overwhelm us, but nothing can approach\
  \ the sheer spellbinding thrill of a communiqu\xE9\_delivered to us tied to the\
  \ leg of an avian herald swooping down from the wide blue empyrean. The Chinese\
  \ Communist Party understands this.\nIt seems quite clear that the first thing Mitt\
  \ Romney ought to have done, having won his party's nomination to run for president,\
  \ was to arrange for the encaging of the entire American pigeon population. Ah,\
  \ you will argue, but Romney was merely the candidate, without the necessary powers.\
  \ I say, Pish! Politics is a dark art, and such technicalities should not be used\
  \ as excuses. All the Man in the Mormon Underpants need have done is to have his\
  \ backroom team devise forged official announcements.\nAmericans, of course, do\
  \ not take kindly to orders from central government, so a hardline approach would\
  \ not have worked. A command such as \u201CCage your pigeon now, on pain of death\
  \ for both you and the pigeon!\u201D would have been torn up and cast into the waste\
  \ chute by the majority of pigeon-owners. A more subtle approach, appealing to traditional\
  \ American values, would be far more effective. \u201CA caged and flight-inhibited\
  \ pigeon is an American pigeon!\u201D is a slogan that might work, as is \u201C\
  In the land of the free, pigeons stay cooped up!\u201D\nWithout such a plan, with\
  \ every day that passed, no doubt the Obama campaign was busy tying messages to\
  \ the legs of pigeons in every hamlet and town and city in every state across the\
  \ land, from sea to shining sea. By the time election day dawned, the damage was\
  \ done.\nInstead of grounding the birds in their coops and cages, could Romney have\
  \ countered with his own troop of pigeons, carrying the Republican message? After\
  \ all, pigeons themselves have no party affiliation, or indeed any affiliation whatsoever\
  \ other than a fondness for pecking millet, making somewhat sinister burbly cooing\
  \ noises, flying hither and thither, and defecating copiously. Tie a message to\
  \ a pigeon's leg, either in writing or pictograms, and the bird will not actually\
  \ try to read it. Remember, they have incredibly tiny brains in their tiny birdy\
  \ heads. They will simply soar away into the sky and carry the message wherever\
  \ they are sent. So, yes, in theory, the Republicans could have stolen a march on\
  \ their rivals by harnessing pigeon propaganda power. Why didn't they?\nIt is no\
  \ accident, I think, that there is absolutely no reference to pigeons in the Book\
  \ of Mormon. I have checked in An Exhaustive Concordance of the Book of Mormon,\
  \ Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price (1977), which helpfully lists\
  \ all the words\u20145,596 of them\u2014and the number of times each one appears\
  \ in that very sensible book. Given Mitt Romney's sincere devotion to his faith,\
  \ we can conclude that he is very probably unaware of the existence of pigeons.\
  \ If Joseph Smith had no occasion to mention them when he transcribed the contents\
  \ of the golden plates, then they are clearly outwith God's plan, and can be ignored,\
  \ even actively shunned. Thus were the seeds sewn of Romney's defeat.\nThis, then,\
  \ is the single crucial lesson the Republicans must learn before the election of\
  \ 2016. They have to bite the bullet and acknowledge the existence of pigeons. That\
  \ is the first step. Take that step, and all else follows. They can then decide\
  \ to campaign on the basis of nationwide pet pigeon encaging and encooping, or tie\
  \ their own messages to the legs of these filthy avian pariahs and let them fly\
  \ free. But they must do one or another. It is the pigeons who will win the election,\
  \ as they have just demonstrated.\n[2012-11-08]"
