text: "I arrived at the Bird Inspectors\u2019 Hut to discover that it had been engulfed\
  \ by a tsunami and lay in ruins. A solitary moorhen was paddling about where the\
  \ door used to be, but there was no sign of the inspectors. I fancied that perhaps\
  \ this might be a talking moorhen which could apprise me where they had gone, and\
  \ asked my question in a slow, clear, loud voice, as one might use in speaking to\
  \ a recalcitrant infant. But of course the moorhen was incapable of speech! What\
  \ was I thinking?\nI felt it more important than ever to track down at least one\
  \ of the bird inspectors and relay my theory that crows were nesting in the horrible\
  \ cave, with alarming consequences. In my experience, most bird inspectors sport\
  \ Italianate mustachios and preen them fanatically with oils and waxes, so I decided\
  \ to head off on foot for the nearest village and seek out a shop selling oils,\
  \ waxes, and other hair treatments.\nI was in luck, for as soon as I strode purposefully\
  \ into the village I saw not only such an emporium, tucked between a wholesaler\
  \ of dinghies and a clapboard hovel, but a man with Italianate mustachios lurking\
  \ in the doorway. He was sopping wet, making his moustache droop, but that made\
  \ it all the more likely he had been caught in the tsunami.\nI hailed him from a\
  \ distance of some forty feet. That is the last thing I can remember. I have no\
  \ idea what happened from that moment until today, three weeks later so I am told,\
  \ when I found myself sitting in an armchair staring out at a dying lawn, being\
  \ proffered cups of tea and mashed potatoes by an oversolicitous nurse. Her name,\
  \ she told me, was Primrose. That name rang a faint bell in my memory. I associated\
  \ it with something petrifying and terrible, but Primrose the nurse seemed to be\
  \ neither. In fact her fawning was getting on my nerves.\nI wanted to ask her where\
  \ I was and how I got here, but she had already skipped off to fetch more potatoes.\
  \ Deciding to follow her, I walked rather unsteadily into a corridor. It was painted\
  \ a hideous shade of orange, and on the walls hung framed portraits of members of\
  \ Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Barclay James Harvest. Was this some\
  \ kind of benighted prog rock haven? I should add that these were paintings rather\
  \ than photographs, although perhaps the word I am looking for is daubs. My infant\
  \ child could do better, if I had an infant child, but I do not. Long ago I vowed\
  \ never to bring a new being into a world with a horrible cave in it, lest the mite\
  \ should accidentally wander into it. I could not forgive myself if such a thing\
  \ happened.\nI could hear what sounded like potatoes being mashed coming from an\
  \ open doorway over to my left. Entering the room, however, I did not find Primrose.\
  \ Instead I was confronted by a slobbering ghoul. It spoke\u2014or rather, groaned\u2014\
  at me in Latin, for it was a Vatican ghoul. Atop its gruesome head I could see the\
  \ tattered remnants of a biretta, in which a number of locusts seemed to be feeding.\
  \ Were they eating the ghoul's straggly locks, or its priestly hat? Or both? I was\
  \ so fascinated by the locusts that I am afraid I paid little attention to the gravel-voiced\
  \ Latin being spouted at me. At this point Primrose came in.\n\u201CThere you are,\
  \ Mr MacTavish!\u201D she cooed sweetly, addressing the ghoul, \u201CI've been looking\
  \ all over for you. It's time for your mashed potato poultice. Come with me, there's\
  \ a dear.\u201D She took it by what I can only assume was its arm and steered it\
  \ away, still groaning. I was rather disconcerted that Primrose had ignored me completely.\
  \ Perhaps I was being oversensitive. I looked at my wristwatch and saw that it was\
  \ just coming up to midday. Why in heaven's name was I dressed in pyjamas? I opened\
  \ a cupboard and rummaged around until I found a shiny and brand new boiler suit.\
  \ I changed into it and checked how I looked in a mirror, noting that its broad\
  \ black and yellow hoops gave me a faint resemblance to a giant bee. It was time\
  \ to leave this place, wherever it was. I pranced out onto the lawn and peered around,\
  \ looking for a signpost.\nI have always been fond of crocuses, and there was a\
  \ clump of them nearby. In the absence of a signpost, I decided I could do worse\
  \ than tarry awhile examining their flowers and leaves, and perhaps scrubbling in\
  \ the soil to have a quick look at the corm. One should take one's pleasures as\
  \ one can, and if I was to stride onward with a spring in my step, a few minutes\u2019\
  \ contemplation of foliage would calm my brain for the inevitable travails ahead.\
  \ These were early crocuses, or Crocus tommasinianus, as no doubt the ghoul could\
  \ have told me. I wondered whereabouts on his grisly frame Primrose the nurse was\
  \ going to apply that poultice of hers. His head? That spindly arm? I wondered,\
  \ too, how she would cope with the locusts, who would devour the mashed potato as\
  \ quickly as she could apply it.\nThus lost in thoughts of potatoes, ghouls and\
  \ crocuses, I failed to notice that a man had approached me, all but silently.\n\
  \u201CGood day to you, sir,\u201D he said, clearing accumulated phlegm from his\
  \ throat as he did so, \u201CWould I be correct in thinking you know something of\
  \ the horrible cave?\u201D\nI looked up, astonished, and saw that my interlocutor\
  \ was none other than the so called limping irredentist, Florenzio Pabstus.\n[2007-03-02]"
