text: "Mr Key's brain is entirely empty today, so here is a piece which previously\
  \ appeared in December 2007.\nThere is a toyshop I know of where they sell toy squirrels\
  \ made of tin. I do not mean the sort of clockwork toy tin squirrels you probably\
  \ had when you were a tot, the ones you wound up and set down and that then skittered\
  \ haphazardly across the floor before crashing into the wainscot. No, the toys of\
  \ which I speak are tin squirrels plain and simple, with no clockwork mechanisms\
  \ nor moving parts. They do not skitter. They come in a variety of sizes, the smallest\
  \ being about the size of a leaf-cutter ant and the most enormous roughly on a par\
  \ with a squirrel-shaped variant of a double-decker bus.\nThere are countless ways\
  \ of having fun with a tin squirrel. You can place it in a crate and cover it with\
  \ shredded newspaper or excelsior and pretend that it is hibernating. When you want\
  \ to bring the hibernation to an end, you can point the beam of an anglepoise lamp\
  \ at the crate, to mimic that mighty orb worshipped by the islanders in The Wicker\
  \ Man, and bring your tin squirrel blinking into the light. Being a toy of tin,\
  \ your squirrel will not actually blink, but with the power of your mind you can\
  \ imagine that it does. If your mind lacks the power to summon up this simple fancy,\
  \ it is a good idea, before switching on the anglepoise lamp, to do a brain exercise\
  \ specifically designed to increase the imaginative faculties. You will need to\
  \ be familiar with the song Imagine, written and performed by John Lennon, the man\
  \ memorably described by Kenneth Williams as \u201Cthat Beatle who got married to\
  \ an Asiatic woman\u201D, although Williams initially confused him with Ringo Starr.\
  \ Actually, you need only know the tune, to which you should sing the following\
  \ words:\nImagine there's a squirrel\n    A squirrel made of tin\n    It's in a\
  \ crate of newspaper\n    Hibernating\n    Imagine you unpack it\n    And place\
  \ it in the light\n    Imagine it is blinking\n    If it wasn't made of tin it might\n\
  In nature, hibernating creatures emerge due to an increase in temperature rather\
  \ than to sunlight, but we are talking here about a tin squirrel in a crate in your\
  \ living room, so some license is allowed, unless you are happy to turn your heating\
  \ off for as long as the tin toy remains packed in newspaper.\nAnother thing you\
  \ can do with your squirrel is to tap it with your fingernails to elicit a tinny\
  \ sound. If you have bitten fingernails, this may not be such an easily-achieved\
  \ pleasure, so you may wish to experiment by tapping the toy with different utensils,\
  \ such as a spoon or a fork or a whisk.\nReal squirrels, ones not made of tin, are\
  \ noted for their devotion to nuts of all kinds, and you can entertain the family\
  \ by creating a tableau. Place your tin toy on, say, a windowsill, and attach some\
  \ twigs and leaves to the window with sticky putty. Then scatter some nuts around\
  \ your squirrel. It doesn't much matter whether they are hazelnuts, Brazil nuts,\
  \ or macadamia nuts, or indeed whatever nuts you happen to have bags of in your\
  \ cupboard. Just cast them upon the windowsill, and gasp as a scene from the savage\
  \ world of nature comes to life before your eyes.\nSpeaking of savagery, it may\
  \ amuse you to set a predator upon your tin squirrel. Owls are particularly fond\
  \ of sinking their fearsome talons into real squirrels and ripping them to pieces,\
  \ but no owl I am aware of is likely to take the slightest interest in a squirrel\
  \ made of tin, for reasons I hope are too obvious to need pointing out, particularly\
  \ if you have been doing that recommended brain exercise, which ought to have pepped\
  \ up the buzz and spark inside your cranium. A tin squirrel would be the quarry\
  \ of a tin owl, so you will need to go to a toyshop that sells such a thing. If\
  \ you have difficulty finding one, you can always fashion a toy owl out of a used\
  \ baked bean tin, by bashing it into shape with a hammer and giving it the appearance\
  \ of an owl with modelling paints or decoupage. Clearly it will only make a believable\
  \ tin predator if your toy squirrel is one of the smaller ones available. If you\
  \ splashed out on the double-decker bus-sized tin squirrel you would be advised\
  \ not to attempt to have it preyed upon by a tin owl, unless you have access to\
  \ a scrap metal merchant and are skilled in the shaping of large amounts of tin\
  \ into birdlike shapes.\nFor more ideas on having fun with your tin squirrel, rummage\
  \ through your local secondhand bookshop and see if you can find a copy of Dobson's\
  \ pamphlet How I Conquered My Fear Of Googie Withers, Together With A Few Tips On\
  \ The Limitless Possibilities For Entertainment Afforded By A Toy Squirrel Made\
  \ Of Tin (out of print).\n[2012-08-10]"
