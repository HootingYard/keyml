  \ Bear in mind, as you consider the spiritual wisdom that follows, that Allah is\
  \ routinely described by his adherents as \u201Cmerciful\u201D. I'd hate to come\
  \ across him in a bad mood\u2026\nThe hellfire is a place of the most extreme suffering,\
  \ the most extreme pain of every level that you can imagine\u2014physical, mental,\
  \ and spiritual pain and suffering and torment. It is a place where Allah will burn\
  \ the skins of the people, and then he will recreate their skins, and burn the skins\
  \ again, so that the people in there will taste the punishment. It is a place of\
  \ heat, a place of pain, a place of suffering. The people will cry in agony for\
  \ water. They will cry for a drink\u2014something to cool them\u2014and they will\
  \ be given water, they will be given a drink, but it is boiling water that will\
  \ scald their faces and burn their insides.\nThey will drink from a river, a river\
  \ that is made from the pus that flows out of the wounds of the people of the hellfire.\
  \ The wounds of the people of the hellfire will ooze pus, and this pus will gather\
  \ together to form a river, and this is all they will have to drink. And their food\
  \ will be the tree of\_Zakum, a tree the fruits of which are like the heads of devils.\
  \ This tree is so bitter that if the people try to eat it, they can't eat it. But\
  \ they will force themselves, because there is nothing else to eat in the hellfire\u2014\
  a place where the people will neither live, nor will they die, a place where the\
  \ people will fall into despair, arguing with each other, admonishing each other,\
  \ criticizing each other. The fire will surround them in every place. The smallest\
  \ punishment of the hellfire is that a person will wear a pair of sandals of fire,\
  \ and their brain will boil\u2026.\nThus Anthony Abdul Rahim Green, spouting on\
  \ Peace TV, amusingly dubbed the \u201C24 Hour Islamic Spiritual Edutainment Satellite\
  \ TV Channel\u201D. Thanks to Mick Hartley.\_\n[2008-11-27]"
