text: "\nI was pleased to note, in this week's newsletter from World Wide Words, that\
  \ Michael Quinion turns his attention to hoity-toity. He tells us that the original\
  \ meaning was \u201Cfrolicsome, romping, giddy, flighty\u201D:\nHoity-toity derives\
  \ from the long-obsolete verb hoit, meaning to \u201Cindulge in riotous and noisy\
  \ mirth\u201D (have you hoited recently? it's supposed to be very good for you)\
  \ or to \u201Cromp inelegantly\u201D (again from the OED; is it even possible to\
  \ romp elegantly?). Where hoit comes from is uncertain, although an early form suggests\
  \ a link with hoyden, which is now an unfashionable way to describe a noisy or energetic\
  \ girl but which at the time could also mean an ignorant or clownish man. This is\
  \ probably from the Middle Dutch heiden, a heath, hence a yokel; if so, hoyden is\
  \ a close relative of heathen.\nCuriously, the estimable Mr Quinion has nothing\
  \ to say about Fort Hoity and Fort Toity, the favourite forts of Hooting Yard readers.\
  \ In fact, other than a few military history buffs and Uncle Tobys, you lot may\
  \ be the only persons who actually have favourite forts. I conducted a sort of straw\
  \ poll on this matter by buttonholing a random selection of pedestrians between\
  \ here and Nameless Pond.\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D I said, standing in front of them\
  \ so they could not pass, \u201CMay I ask you which is your favourite fort?\u201D\
  \ I did not get a single coherent or sensible answer. Perhaps had I armed myself\
  \ with a clipboard and a biro and a high visibility jacket the results would have\
  \ been different. But on the evidence of my admittedly unscientific survey, I am\
  \ forced to conclude that one hundred percent of riffraff infesting the streets\
  \ of my bailiwick early on a Saturday morning care not a jot for forts of any kind.\
  \ Some of them seemed not to know what in heaven's name I was talking about. That\
  \ is the modern education system for you.\nAs fanatically devoted Hooting Yard readers,\
  \ you already knew, or at least suspected, that you were members of a select band.\
  \ Now you have further confirmation, in that you can most definitely claim to be\
  \ among that minuscule portion of the populace who have a favourite fort. My research,\
  \ such as it is, tells me that you are pretty evenly divided between Fort Hoity\
  \ fans and aficionados of Fort Toity. I have not analysed the stats in great detail,\
  \ partly because there aren't really any reliable stats on this matter, and partly\
  \ because, even if there were, I doubt that I am capable of the drudgery necessary\
  \ to analyse them. I have better things to do with my time, such as smoking and\
  \ staring out of the window at crows while listening to Essay On Pigs by Hans Werner\
  \ Henze. It's a godawful racket, but it drowns out the sound of the neighbouring\
  \ tinies, whose screeching would otherwise unhinge me.\nOver the years, several\
  \ readers have asked me to give a clear and highly amusing account of the differences\
  \ between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. I suspect that such requests are based not\
  \ on any genuine keenness to be able to tell the forts apart as much as a desire\
  \ to have some justification for plumping for one fort over the other. It is, after\
  \ all, a mark of the truly \u2018with-it\u2019 Hooting Yardist that they care enough\
  \ to choose Fort Hoity over Fort Toity, or, of course, Fort Toity over Fort Hoity.\
  \ Nobody wants to admit to not giving a hoot one way or the other, as if they were\
  \ the riffraff in the vicinity of Nameless Pond.\nBut while it is easy enough to\
  \ cry \u201CFort Hoity!\u201D or \u201CFort Toity!\u201D when asked which is your\
  \ favourite fort, far more difficult is the supplementary question, \u201CWhy?\u201D\
  \ Personally, I never ask that myself. I never wish to entangle my readers in potentially\
  \ brain-numbing mental gorse bushes. As far as I am concerned, it is enough that\
  \ each of you has a favourite fort. But great heavens to Betsy, some of the tales\
  \ I have heard from Hooting Yard picnics and charabanc outings and mass singalongs,\
  \ indeed from any occasion where two or more Hooting Yard readers gather together!\
  \ Here is one such tale, related in a letter received from one T. Thurn:\nOh wondrous\
  \ and resplendent Mr Key!\nI wish to tell you about an incident that occurred at\
  \ a recent Hooting Yard outing. A quartet of us had gone on an otter rescue mission,\
  \ but the circumstances in themselves are not important. When we were still some\
  \ distance from the riverbank, one of my companions asked me which was my favourite\
  \ fort, Fort Hoity or Fort Toity? \u201CFort Toity\u201D, I replied. Then she dropped\
  \ a bombshell. \u201CWhy?\u201D she asked. I realised I was quite unable to answer\
  \ the question, as I have no idea of the difference between the two forts, other\
  \ than a vague inkling that Fort Toity is a bit smaller then Fort Hoity. I was forced\
  \ to dissemble. I pointed at the sky and yelled \u201CLook!\u201D, hoping there\
  \ would be a flock of some kind of birds visible. Alas, it was one of those birdless\
  \ days, so I had to pretend I had spotted unusual patterns of light and shadow presaging\
  \ the collapse and ruination of the empyrean realms. I got away with it this time,\
  \ but I would be grateful if you could provide a clear and highly amusing account\
  \ of the differences between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity so that, next time I am asked,\
  \ I will be able to justify my plumping.\nYours frolicsome, romping, giddy, and\
  \ flighty,\nT. Thurn xxxx\nMust I do all the work? If T. Thurn had any strength\
  \ of character he would refrain from bothering me with his tiresome whinges. I have\
  \ gaspers to smoke and crows to watch and combative Teutonic din to listen to! It\
  \ would be a simple enough matter for any true devotee to read through the collected\
  \ Fort Hoity and Fort Toity references and to compile their own list of plumping\
  \ reasons. That should keep you lot occupied until the morrow.\n[2012-09-15]"
