text: "August has been exceedingly fecund here at Hooting Yard, with more postages\
  \ in a single month than at any time since the site reared its gorgeous head almost\
  \ seven years ago. However, I now wish to alert readers to the possibility that\
  \ things may quieten down for a week or so, the reason being that a critical stage\
  \ has been reached in the production of this year's Lulu paperback. Yes!, fear not,\
  \ fairly soon now your Christmas-present-purchasing-befuddlement will be washed\
  \ away, like the blood of the lamb, with the publication of another fat (350 pages\
  \ or thereabouts) anthology of mighty lopsided prose, direct from Mr Key's pea-sized\
  \ yet pulsating brain to the printed page!\nThe mind-numbing business of bashing\
  \ the book together is at an advanced stage, formatting the text and proofreadnig\
  \ and reformatting the text, etcetera etcetera ad nauseam.. This ought to be a simple\
  \ matter, but as the ever-reliable Mr Fadhley, who directs the operation, points\
  \ out, the programme used to create the book \u201Cwas designed by nerds for nerds\
  \ and is monstrously complex\u201D. Think of that when, eventually, you clutch the\
  \ treasured tome in your dainty little hands, as tiny as Scriabin's, if that is\
  \ an approximate description of your hands, though I realise it may not be. You\
  \ may have huge hairy paws. It matters not.\nSo for the next few days at least I\
  \ will be trying to tackle the remaining monstrous complexities. Should anything\
  \ momentous bubble up in my cranium I shall try to post it here, but I thought it\
  \ worth alerting you that things may quieten down just a tad.\nMeanwhile, you might\
  \ want to make a day trip to Beccles.\n[2010-08-31]"
