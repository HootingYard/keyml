text: "There is an argument to be had that the well-groomed moustache is representative\
  \ of all that is best in a certain apprehension of Western civilization, where gravitas,\
  \ punctilio and rectitude are prized as essential qualities. Clearly the moustache\
  \ cannot, in and of itself, guarantee that the pinnacle of social conduct has been\
  \ achieved. We need only think of the luxuriant moustaches of, on the one hand,\
  \ the savage Ancient Gauls and, on the other, the hippies and motorbikeists of nineteen-seventies\
  \ America (think Easy Rider) to recognise the absurdity of that conceit.\nAnd yet,\
  \ within a larger context, one that includes manners and customs and dress and even\
  \ carriage and posture, the moustache is incontrovertibly the icing on the cake,\
  \ as it were. Remove the moustache and you remove a crucial\u2014I would go so far\
  \ as to say a necessary\u2014element of civilization at its most civilized.\nConsider\
  \ for a moment the splendid moustache of Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary (1817\u2013\
  1867), previously Archduke Stephen Francis Victor of Austria, governor of Bohemia\
  \ from 1843 to 1847.\n\nIt is no accident, I think, that in this photograph the\
  \ gaze of Archduchess Hermine of Austria is concentrated fixedly upon that moustache.\
  \ Dapper as he is in his coat and trousers and shiny shoes, insouciant as he leans\
  \ against a weighty carved wooden credenza, an imaginary clean-shaven Palatine would\
  \ cut far less impressive a figure. Indeed, one cannot help thinking that Emperor\
  \ Ferdinand I of Austria would have withheld the governorship of Bohemia from him\
  \ until such time as he sprouted an appropriate moustache.\nThe Archduchess, incidentally,\
  \ was not the wife of the Archduke, for he never married. It is quite possible that\
  \ any prospective brides were intimidated by the moustache, perhaps intuiting that\
  \ the Archduke's mental and emotional energies were devoted to its cultivation and\
  \ care, leaving little to spare for connubial shenanigans. Such a conclusion is\
  \ borne out by careful and painstaking study of the countenance of the Archduchess\
  \ in the photograph. You might want to deploy a magnifying glass, but I think you\
  \ will agree with me.\nThere is a story, which I have just made up, that Archduke\
  \ Stephen, finding the coffers of Bohemia alarmingly depleted, once made use of\
  \ his moustache to raise much-needed funds. He staged a competition, open to all\
  \ the citizens of Bohemia, the challenge being to make an accurate estimation of\
  \ the number of individual hairs in his moustache. Each Bohemian paid a crown to\
  \ enter, and having done so qualified to write down their chosen number on a scrap\
  \ of paper, the gathered scraps being collected by one of the Archduke's henchmen,\
  \ together with the crowns. It is said that a barber from a Bohemian village was\
  \ brought to the palace, armed with a comb and a counting-stick, about the size\
  \ of a modern safety match, and was ordered to count one by one the hairs in the\
  \ Archducal moustache. Before this humble yet numerate artisan could complete his\
  \ task, however, Archduke Stephen's father died, and he inherited the title of Count\
  \ Palatine of Hungary, and left Bohemia for good, taking all the crowns with him\
  \ but leaving the scraps of paper with numbers written upon them, shoved all jumbled\
  \ up in the weighty carved wooden credenza against which he is seen leaning in that\
  \ photograph. The exact number of hairs in his magnificent moustache never was calculated,\
  \ more's the pity.\n[2012-01-02]"
