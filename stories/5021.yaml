text: "One of the more intriguing Sherlock Holmes cases unrecorded by Dr Watson is\
  \ the affair of the bogus laundry. It is mentioned in The Adventure Of The Cardboard\
  \ Box, where Inspector Lestrade writes to Holmes:\n\u201CHe is a big, powerful chap,\
  \ clean-shaven, and very swarthy\u2014something like Aldridge, who helped us in\
  \ the bogus laundry affair.\u201D\nI suppose \u201Claundry\u201D here refers to\
  \ the business establishment, to what we might today call a launderette, rather\
  \ than to the stuff itself, cravats and sheets and shirts and socks etc. gathered\
  \ in a hamper. But perhaps not. Given the wild fancies of Conan Doyle's imagination,\
  \ either is possible.\nAnd, just as the word \u201Claundry\u201D is open to more\
  \ than one interpretation, so is \u201Cmodel\u201D. What are we to make of this,\
  \ recently drawn to our attention by Backwatersman?\n\nA model laundry? Abstracted,\
  \ perhaps, from a model village like Bekonscot and left to fend for itself in a\
  \ Derbyshire townlet? \u201CCome, tinies, we are going on an outing to see the model\
  \ laundry!\u201D If the hampers of laundry in the model laundry are bogus, what\
  \ then? What then?\nIt is enough to give me a swimming in the head.\n[2010-08-13]"
