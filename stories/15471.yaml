text: "One of the places I visited on my recent holiday was described to me as \u201C\
  an insolent little town, turning its back on the tortured sea\u201D. Tortured the\
  \ sea may have been, but it was neither dolphin-torn nor gong-tormented, though\
  \ given my guide's turns of phrase perhaps it ought to have been. Among the sights\
  \ of the town\u2014snapped by Pansy Cradledew\u2014was this absurd flaneur prancing\
  \ like a ninny along the boulevards before posing for the camera.\n\n[2017-07-24]"
