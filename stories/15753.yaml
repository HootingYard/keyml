text: "One day late in the last century I acted as amanuensis to my son Sam, then\
  \ a tiny tot. He told me a story. I wrote it down. Then I typed it out and made\
  \ it into a pamphlet entitled The Story Of The Castle, The Knight, & The Dragon\
  \ (out of print). Here is that story.\n\_\nOnce there was a brave knight and the\
  \ brave knight heard a sort of dragon noise.\nAnd when he heard it he went to tell\
  \ his gang of knights to search for the dragon and kill it. And they couldn't find\
  \ it.\nWell, in the end they found it and they killed it and they went to tell the\
  \ king and queen and the prince and the princess and all the other people in the\
  \ kingdom\u2014when they found there was another dragon!\nAnd the king ran up to\
  \ the chain and he pulled the drawbridge up so the dragon couldn't get in. And the\
  \ queen looked out of the window to see if the dragon fell into the water round\
  \ the castle (the moat).\nAnd the dragon had flown over the mountains and ran back\
  \ as fast as it could and butted the drawbridge open.\nAnd suddenly the king and\
  \ queen were surprised, because the brave knight put a spear into the dragon's tummy\
  \ and the dragon was dead. So the knight went to tell the people in the kingdom.\n\
  Then they saw that the dragon came alive again. And it was a magic spell when the\
  \ dragon came alive again because the dragon was nice really.\nAnd they found out\
  \ that it could speak and it said to them that it would do everything for them in\
  \ the kingdom. It would even find the cannonballs for them. And that's the end.\n\
