text: "The other day I was woken from a much-needed nap by a screech. I identified\
  \ it, instantly, as the screech of a screech owl, for I am ever alert to occurrences\
  \ of an ornithological kidney. I peered out of the window and spotted the owl, perched\
  \ on a picket fence. I pranced outside, went straight towards the owl, bunched my\
  \ fist, and thumped it in what I supposed was its solar plexus. The owl toppled\
  \ from the fence, looking mightily disconcerted. As soon as it hit the ground, it\
  \ righted itself, unfurled its wings, and flew away. I watched until it had vanished\
  \ in the blue empyrean, which in truth was grey and overcast rather than blue, but\
  \ empyrean nonetheless, and then I returned indoors to resume my nap.\nThe next\
  \ day I answered a knock at the door to be confronted by a gangly beanpole wearing\
  \ some sort of peaked cap with glittering metal insignia pinned to it.\n\u201CInterrogative\_\
  : would you be Mr Key?\u201D he said.\n\u201CC'est moi!\u201D I replied, foolishly,\
  \ for I was in foolish spirits.\n\u201CInterrogative,\u201D he said, again, \u201C\
  Yesterday, did you thump an owl, knocking it from its perch?\u201D\n\u201CI did,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CIt was a screech owl and its screech woke me from a much-needed\
  \ nap.\u201D\n\u201CInterrogative,\u201D he said yet again, and this time I interrupted\
  \ him.\n\u201CWhy do you keep saying \u2018interrogative\u2019?\u201D\n\u201CDon't\
  \ get snippy with me, Mr Key, just answer my questions. Interrogative\_: are you\
  \ aware that the thumping of owls is in contravention of the municipal bye-laws\
  \ regarding conduct towards and/or in the presence of owls?\u201D\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\
  \ I said, so he repeated himself, so I did too, and he was about to rerepeat himself\
  \ when I flicked at his face a morsel of smokers\u2019 poptart I happened to be\
  \ holding and told him to go away. This was a mistake. He bunched his fist and thumped\
  \ me in the solar plexus.\nWhen I was able to breathe again, he helped me inside,\
  \ and we sat facing each other at the breakfast table.\n\u201CA word of advice,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CIt is never a good idea to try to stymie the activities of a senior\
  \ officer of the Civic Owl Squad going about his lawful business. As you have learned.\
  \ Now let there be no more nonsense from you. I am invested with powers more draconian,\
  \ more merciless, than you could imagine in your wildest and most sweat-drenched,\
  \ pillow-gnawing nightmares.\u201D\n\u201CErk-gah\u201D was all I could say, for\
  \ I was still winded.\n\u201CNow. You have admitted to thumping an owl. I have it\
  \ down on my pocket cassette recorder. Your nap is of no concern to us, by the way.\
  \ By \u2018us\u2019 I mean myself and the screech owl you thumped. Though not present,\
  \ I can assure you that it can hear every word you say, for screech owls are blessed\
  \ with a tremendously good sense of hearing. I offer that tip in case you were minded\
  \ to say something disobliging about the owl when you recover the power of speech.\
  \ It will be listening carefully to everything you say for several months, until,\
  \ that is, you have made complete restitution for your thumping.\u201D\n\u201CReugh?\u201D\
  \ I gasped.\n\u201CPrecisely,\u201D he said, \u201CRestitution. Every day, for the\
  \ next several months, you will fill this sack\u201D\u2014at which he whacked a\
  \ large burlap sack upon the table\u2014\u201Cwith insects, reptiles, small mammals\
  \ such as bats and mice and small birds such as wrens and hummingbirds. You will\
  \ deliver the sack, filled to the brim\u2014to the brim!\u2014every morning at six\
  \ a.m. on the dot to your neighbourhood Civic Owl Squad drop-in centre. Woe betide\
  \ you if you fail to comply.\u201D\nI wondered for a moment of what that woe might\
  \ consist, but decided it was better for my nervous equilibrium not to ask.\n\u201C\
  Thank you for your cooperation,\u201D said the gangly beanpole, \u201CI will see\
  \ myself out. And I am sure you don't mind me helping myself to one of your smokers\u2019\
  \ poptarts.\u201D\nI did mind\u2014but what could I do?\nThe next day, after filling\
  \ the sack to the brim with insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice\
  \ and small birds such as wrens and hummingbirds, and delivering it to the drop-in\
  \ centre, I returned home exhausted and took a much-needed nap. I was woken by a\
  \ howl. I identified it, instantly, as the howl of a howler monkey, for I am ever\
  \ alert to occurrences of a simian kidney.\n[2017-01-25]"
