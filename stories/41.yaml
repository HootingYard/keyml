text: 'Here is an outdoor game for all the family. After singing lustily at the Sunday
  service, and having a little chat with the vicar on the church steps, you should
  repair to a patch of waste ground, taking with you a couple of battered iron pails,
  an unopened packet of processed cheese triangles, and some strips of bark from a
  pugton tree. Each family member should don a red balaclava, apart from the tiniest
  one, who goes bare-headed. One side of the patch of waste ground is designated Nobby
  Stiles. The opposite side is consecrated to David Blunkett. The object of the game
  is to get from Stiles to Blunkett as directly as possible, cleanly and without undue
  dithering. If the patch of waste ground is assailed by inclement weather, for instance
  a howling gale, a teeming downpour, or thunder and lightning, the family may be
  accompanied by beetle-browed urchins from beyond the railway tracks. Use counters
  and a tally stick to keep score.
