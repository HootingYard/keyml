text: "With my siphon and funnel I march to the hills, stamping on insects to add\
  \ to my kills. I have distributed thousands of pills, and now I must hide in a grot.\n\
  My siphon! My siphon! I dropped it back there. I must go and fetch it while the\
  \ weather stands fair. I will need it within my elfin grot lair. So I retrace my\
  \ steps at a trot.\nMy pathway is barred by a knight at arms. Alone and pale, he\
  \ lacks all charms. I think I have seen him patrolling the farms, the farms where\
  \ I poisoned the poultry.\nPalely loitering like a monitor lizard, the knight plunges\
  \ his lance right into my gizzard. \u201CI am no knight, I'm a pinball wizard!\u201D\
  \ cries this latter-day Roger Daltrey.\nI crumple to earth and let fall my funnel.\
  \ I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\_A clich\xE9 I know, but as long\
  \ as the sun'll shine I'll stay clear of the fiery pit.\nThe wizard twirls a mic\
  \ on the end of a lead. By Christ, it is Roger Daltrey indeed! Is he going to sing\
  \ in my hour of need? He's such a preposterous git!\nI reach for my funnel and chuck\
  \ it at him. But the light at the end of the tunnel grows dim. My immediate prospects\
  \ are decidedly grim. To die at the hands of The Who!\n\u201CSee me, feel me, touch\
  \ me \u2013\u201D I groan. \u201CNo, you must reap what you have sown\u201D says\
  \ Daltrey as I wail and moan. I am but left to rue.\nI rue that I killed every hen,\
  \ every duck, all the innocent pigs in their filthy muck. I was being an evil countryside\
  \ Puck. Now I just want my Mommy.\nGore spouts from my gizzard, my life leaks away.\
  \ But worse is to come \u2018fore I call it a day. With his awful hair like a bale\
  \ of hay, Daltrey shakes it and starts to sing \u201CTommy\u201D.\nAt the last,\
  \ the mercy of God doth abide. As he opened his gob, I died.\n[2010-08-16]"
