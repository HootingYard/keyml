text: "Sabine Baring-Gould Week at Hooting Yard began on Sunday 5th December, so I\
  \ suppose it has now expired. I had been hoping to regale you with some choice snippets\
  \ from his biography of Robert Stephen Hawker, The Vicar Of Morwenstow (1886), but,\
  \ frankly, I was a little disappointed. The most arresting of Hawker's eccentricities\
  \ are listed in the opening paragraph of this piece, and Baring-Gould has little\
  \ to add, save perhaps for a detailed account of the dressing-up-as-a-mermaid incident.\
  \ (Part of my disappointment was to discover that this was a single occurrence rather\
  \ than a general Hawker pastime.) However, the book is not without its pleasures,\
  \ and I feel before we say farewell to Sabine we should mark this additional note\
  \ about the vicar:\n\u201CAfter the death of Mrs Hawker, he fell into a condition\
  \ of piteous depression, and began to eat opium. He moped about the cliffs, or in\
  \ his study, and lost interest in every thing\u2026\n\u201CHe took it into his head\
  \ that he could eat nothing but clotted cream. He therefore made his meals, breakfast,\
  \ dinner, and tea, of this. He became consequently exceedingly bilious, and his\
  \ depression grew the greater.\u201D\nThere is another particularly splendid passage,\
  \ in which Baring-Gould transcribes the wording of a sign outside a \u201Clittle\
  \ shop\u201D in Cornwall. I have in turn transcribed it, and it is due to appear\
  \ in my cupboard at The Dabbler this coming Friday. So there is something for you\
  \ all to look forward to.\n[2010-12-13]"
