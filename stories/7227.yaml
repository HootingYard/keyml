  \ me a snap of his membership card for Toad Suck Buck's, a \u201Crestaurant and\
  \ river vista\u201D in Toad Suck, Arkansas. Toad Suck, I am told, is in a \u201C\
  dry\u201D county, so in order to serve its customers with alcoholic beverages, Buck's\
  \ is a \u201Cprivite\u201D club. I am eager to join, and I bet you are too. Meanwhile,\
  \ I am thrilled to know there is a Toad Suck Branch of the Hooting Yard Fan Club.\n\
