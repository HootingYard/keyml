  \ to me like a name from Game Of Thrones. One imagines Stav hanging out with, say,\
  \ Stannis Baratheon or Daenerys Targaryen. That being so, it is somewhat puzzling\
  \ that his weather forecasts do not consist simply of the words \u201Cwinter is\
  \ coming\u201D, every day.\n\n[2014-08-13]"
