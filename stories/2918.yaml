text: "There are great unwritten works we mourn, books their authors planned but never\
  \ penned. Ruskin's survey of Swiss towns and villages is one, Dobson's series of\
  \ pamphlets provisionally entitled Sundry Imperilments Of The Mists And The Marshes\
  \ is another. We know from his scribblings that the out of print pamphleteer intended\
  \ to write no fewer than sixteen essays, each devoted to a particular menace of\
  \ mist and marsh, yet he never completed a single one, nor even began any of them,\
  \ possibly due to sheer unalloyed ignorance. So when we want to familiarise ourselves\
  \ with so important a topic, we must turn to Daniel Defoe:\n\u201CI have one remark\
  \ more, before I leave this damp part of the world, and which I cannot omit on the\
  \ womens account; namely, that I took notice of a strange decay of the sex here;\
  \ insomuch, that all along this county it was very frequent to meet with men that\
  \ had had from five or six, to fourteen or fifteen wives; nay, and some more; and\
  \ I was inform'd that in the marshes on the other side the river over-against Candy\
  \ Island, there was a farmer, who was then living with the five and twentieth wife,\
  \ and that his son who was but about 35 years old, had already had about fourteen;\
  \ indeed this part of the story, I only had by report, tho\u2019 from good hands\
  \ too; but the other is well known, and easie to be inquired in to, about Fobbing,\
  \ Curringham, Thundersly, Benfleet, Prittlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Cricksea,\
  \ Burnham, Dengy, and other towns of the like situation: The reason, as a merry\
  \ fellow told me, who said he had had about a dozen and half of wives, (tho\u2019\
  \ I found afterwards he fibb'd a little) was this; That they being bred in the marshes\
  \ themselves, and season'd to the place, did pretty well with it; but that they\
  \ always went up into the hilly country, or to speak their own language into the\
  \ uplands for a wife: That when they took the young lasses out of the wholesome\
  \ and fresh air, they were healthy, fresh and clear, and well; but when they came\
  \ out of their native air into the marshes among the fogs and damps, there they\
  \ presently chang'd their complexion, got an ague or two, and seldom held it above\
  \ half a year, or a year at most; and then, said he, we go to the uplands again,\
  \ and fetch another.\u201D\nFrom A tour thro\u2019 the Whole Island of Great Britain\
