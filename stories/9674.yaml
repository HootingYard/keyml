text: "There are circumstances in which you may find yourself standing in a field\
  \ alongside a Scandinavian peasant, staring at the sky. The peasant may turn to\
  \ you and say:\nMorgenrode gir dage blode,\n  Kveldsrode gir dage sode.\nWhat is\
  \ an appropriate response? You could, of course, remain silent, while moulding your\
  \ countenance into an expression of sagacity. A slight furrowing of the brow, a\
  \ pursing of the lips, an intense look in the eyes, perhaps an almost imperceptible\
  \ nod of the head. You could even rub your chin thoughtfully, as Mr Carter does\
  \ in the Jennings & Darbyshire books by Anthony Buckeridge. The Scandinavian peasant\
  \ will almost certainly take this as due acknowledgement. This is the safest course\
  \ of action if you have no idea what he is babbling on about.\nBut it may be that\
  \ you have a smattering of some Scandinavian languages, or are wearing a hidden\
  \ earpiece which provides you with a simultaneous translation. Both are possibilities\
  \ if you are, for example, a diplomat, or a special rapporteur of the United Nations.\
  \ There may be other reasons why one or both is the case, such as family background\
  \ or the habit of international jet-setting for either business or leisure purposes.\
  \ Your knowledge, or earpiece, will thus apprise you of the meaning of the peasant's\
  \ utterance, which can be given as:\nMorning red gives wet days,\n  Evening red\
  \ gives sweet days.\nArmed, then, with the knowledge that the peasant is spouting\
  \ rustic wisdom, or weather lore, you may wish to consider a verbal response. You\
  \ can still do the whole business with the brow and the lips and the eyes and the\
  \ head and the chin, but this time as a preliminary gambit. Then you might counter\
  \ with a countryside adage of your own, for example:\nRed sky at night, shepherd's\
  \ delight,\n  Red sky in morning, fisherman's warning.\nor, if the field in which\
  \ you are standing alongside the Scandinavian peasant is within the vicinity of\
  \ the sea, or of a fjord, you might say:\nRed sky at night, sailor's delight,\n\
  \  Red sky at morning, sailors take warning.\nThe problem with this approach is\
  \ that the Scandinavian peasant may be prompted to bat back a further piece of his\
  \ own rustic wisdom, to which you will feel compelled to supply a rejoinder. You\
  \ will swiftly find yourself embroiled in an escalating exchange of countryside\
  \ proverbs which you cannot win. He is a peasant, and you are not. He will always\
  \ be able to top your saw with something more abstruse, born of generations of experience\
  \ tilling the Scandinavian fields. You should therefore deploy a different tactic.\
  \ Instead of following the brow and the lips and the eyes and the head and the chin\
  \ business with a couplet of weather lore, you should allow a significant pause,\
  \ and then say:\nAnd in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day: for the sky\
  \ is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can\
  \ ye not discern the signs of the times?\nThis is a Biblical quotation, from the\
  \ Gospel of Matthew, 16:3. Assuming for one moment that the Scandinavian peasant\
  \ does not take it personally, it is likely that he will be stunned into silence,\
  \ like a dumb ox. You then have the advantage. But bear in mind the possibility\
  \ that he does take it personally, and thinks you are accusing him, wildly, of hypocrisy.\
  \ He may be a violent peasant, and lift up his spade to bash you about the head.\
  \ If you are wearing a hidden earpiece, a bash will dislodge it, and you will no\
  \ longer have the simultaneous translation to let you know what he is saying. To\
  \ prevent this happening, you should have in your pocket some kind of treat with\
  \ which to placate him. A piece of smoked and dried herring will usually suffice.\
  \ You should keep it wrapped in greaseproof paper to avoid sullying the lining of\
  \ your pocket.\nThere is, however, the possibility that he may be a Bible-thumping\
  \ Scandinavian peasant, as familiar with the Old and New Testaments as he is with\
  \ weather lore. If this is the case, he may respond to your Matthew 16:3 with, say,\
  \ his Isaiah 36:16\u201317:\nDrick var och en vatten i sin brunn, tills jag kommer\
  \ och tar dig bort.\nThis will put you in something of a pickle. Unless you have\
  \ the measure of his Bible-learning, and how could you?, you have no guarantee that\
  \ you will be able to match him quote for quote. Remember he may well be a Lutheran.\
  \ You will need to be pretty damn confident of your own store of memorised Biblical\
  \ verses to embark upon a tit-for-tat. Weighing things in the balance, your best\
  \ option is to reply:\nDrink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I\
  \ come and take you away.\nBy merely echoing back at him the Authorised Version\
  \ version of his own sally, you may well succeed in bringing the exchange to a close.\
  \ Neither of you has outwitted the other, neither of you has lost face. He can take\
  \ up his spade and go off to till his fields in a peasanty way, and you can wander\
  \ off in the opposite direction, to your holiday chalet, or special rapporteur's\
  \ concrete pillbox, or wherever it is you are staying. When both of you have walked\
  \ about twenty paces, you might turn and wave to each other, in amicable farewell.\
  \ The next morning, or evening, when you encounter each other again in the field,\
  \ you will both be better prepared, and companionable silence will almost certainly\
  \ be appropriate.\nNext week, in our series on conversational gambits with Scandinavian\
  \ peasants, we will look at the best approach should you find yourself talking of\
  \ the varying merits of agricultural implements. For your homework, make a list\
  \ of farm implements mentioned in the Bible, using as your sources both the Authorised\
  \ Version and a Scandinavian-language Lutheran edition.\n[2012-07-17]"
