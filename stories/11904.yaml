text: "Here is the piece I wrote for BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet a couple of weeks\
  \ ago, reposted here for the sake of The Complete And Utter Mr Key Prose Experience.\n\
  It is an exciting time in the world of breakfast. I learned as much last week, when\
  \ I had the good fortune to be invited to a new product launch. The do took place\
  \ in a swish and sophisticated hotel, and as I am neither swish nor sophisticated\
  \ I was a bit worried that I would be thrown out on my ear, if indeed I was allowed\
  \ in at all. I decided that I would cut something of a dash by wearing spats. Unfortunately,\
  \ my footwear adviser misconstrued what I said, and I arrived at the swish and sophisticated\
  \ hotel wearing galoshes. But I need not have fretted. Such was the atmosphere of\
  \ new-breakfast-product excitement and hubbub that I made my way into the throng\
  \ without incident.\nAnd what a throng! The hotel ballroom was packed to the rafters\
  \ with the great and the good, the movers and shakers, the glitterati, and Krishnan\
  \ Guru-Murthy from Channel 4 News. I grabbed a glass of aerated lettucewater from\
  \ a tray held by a minion, and leaned against a mantelpiece in what I hoped was\
  \ an insouciant manner.\nAfter a series of speeches from big names in the breakfast\
  \ world, the new product was eventually revealed\u2014smokers\u2019 poptarts! After\
  \ we had oohed and aahed at the gorgeous packaging, we were treated to a demonstration\
  \ of how best to prepare this toothsome breakfast-related snack item. Apparently,\
  \ you remove the smokers\u2019 poptart from its greaseproof-paper wrapping, pop\
  \ it into a toaster, and wait. It was rather unfortunate that the toaster used at\
  \ the launch was a 1972 model from the former Soviet Union, for it malfunctioned,\
  \ with a lot of buzzing and hissing noises, before a billow of black smoke rose\
  \ from it and choked several celebrities standing nearby, one of whom I think may\
  \ have been Yoko Ono. The smokers\u2019 poptart itself was burned to ashes, of course.\n\
  By this time we were all growing very peckish, and had been looking forward to munching\
  \ this delicious new breakfast product. Instead, the hotel chef rustled up a vast\
  \ quantity of bubble and squeak. It was rather like the miracle of the loaves and\
  \ the fishes (Matthew 14:13\u201321, Mark 6:31\u201344, Luke 9:10\u201317 and John\
  \ 6:5\u201315), except with bubble and squeak rather than bread and fish.\nBy the\
  \ time an oompah band started up, we were all stuffed to the gills, albeit not with\
  \ smokers\u2019 poptarts. But we accepted our brochures, information sheets, and\
  \ balloons with good grace, and it was a reasonably happy crowd that spilled out\
  \ into the hotel carpark. Interestingly, the carpark was pitted with puddles, oh!\
  \ puddles innumerable, and all the great and the good and the movers and shakers\
  \ and glitterati got their shoes and socks soaked through. I thanked the Lord for\
  \ my galoshes, and Krishnan Guru-Murthy thanked the Lord for his galoshes, thoughtfully\
  \ provided by an unpaid intern from Channel 4 News.\nAs I wended my way home through\
  \ certain half-deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in one-night\
  \ cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells, I resolved to buy a carton\
  \ of smokers\u2019 poptarts for my breakfast at the earliest opportunity. Alas,\
  \ I have yet to see them on the shelves of the local poptart shop. As Jagger once\
  \ observed, you can't always get what you want.\nNOTE\_: As this was written for\
  \ an audience largely unfamiliar with the Mr Key Prose Experience, I deliberately\
  \ inserted a number of my common obsessions, phrases, tropes, and touches. A small\
  \ prize to any Hooting Yard reader who can spot all of them.\n[2013-08-29]"
