text: "The willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I am not a bird\u2014\
  obviously!\u2014but I, too, have warbled in willows. It is a simple enough matter.\
  \ What you do is locate a clump of willows, then wander into the midst of them,\
  \ and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps\
  \ when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece,\
  \ you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. \u201CI am a willow\
  \ warbler\u201D, you can say, truthfully.\nAmong the various definitions given for\
  \ warble in the OED, the one I find particularly helpful is \u201CTo twitter, as\
  \ a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at singing\u201D. This is my kind of\
  \ warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing for toffee. But there is nothing to\
  \ stop me making \u201Cuncertain attempts\u201D at singing, in the midst of a clump\
  \ of willows, whenever the mood takes me. And take me it often does!, to the point\
  \ of mania.\nI have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble\u2014or sing uncertainly\u2014\
  on my willowy jaunts. Land Of Ladies by the Brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox,\
  \ Boom Bang-A-Bang by Lulu, and Nunc dimittis servum tuum by The Toofles are among\
  \ my favourites. I struggle with the words\u2014and tunes\u2014of all of them, but\
  \ that is par for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.\n\
