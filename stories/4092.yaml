text: "Here is some more from Thomas Chalmers, a master of blithering nonsense wrapped\
  \ in majestic prose. This is again from Discourses On The Christian Revelation,\
  \ Viewed In Connection With The Modern Astronomy (1817):\n\u201CWhat we have now\
  \ to remark is, that the Infidel who urges the astronomical objection to the truth\
  \ of Christianity, is only looking with half an eye to the principle on which it\
  \ rests. Carry out the principle, and the objection vanishes. He looks abroad on\
  \ the immensity of space, and tells us how impossible it is, that this narrow corner\
  \ of it can be so distinguished by the attentions of the Deity. Why does he not\
  \ also look abroad on the magnificence of eternity; and perceive how the whole period\
  \ of these peculiar attentions, how the whole time which elapses between the fall\
  \ of man and the consummation of the scheme of his recovery, is but the twinkling\
  \ of a moment to the mighty roll of innumerable ages? The whole interval between\
  \ the time of Jesus Christ's leaving his Father's abode to sojourn amongst us, to\
  \ that time when He shall have put all His enemies under his feet, and delivered\
  \ up the kingdom to God even His Father, that God may be all in all; the whole of\
  \ this interval bears as small a proportion to the whole of the Almighty's reign,\
  \ as this solitary world does to the universe around it; and an infinitely smaller\
  \ proportion than any time, however short, which an earthly monarch spends on some\
  \ enterprise of private benevolence, does to the whole walk of his public and recorded\
  \ history.\n\u201CWhy then does not the man, who can shoot his conceptions so sublimely\
  \ abroad over the field of an immensity that knows no limits\u2014why does he not\
  \ also shoot them forward through the vista of a succession, that ever flows without\
  \ stop and without termination? He has stept across the confines of this world's\
  \ habitation in space, and out of the field which lies on the other side of it has\
  \ he gathered an argument against the truth of revelation. We feel that we have\
  \ nothing to do but to step across the confines of this world's history in time,\
  \ and out of the futurity which lies beyond it can we gather that which will blow\
  \ the argument to pieces, or stamp upon it all the narrowness of a partial and mistaken\
  \ calculation. The day is coming when the whole of this wondrous history shall be\
  \ looked back upon by the eye of remembrance, and be regarded as one incident in\
  \ the extended annals of creation; and, with all the illustration and all the glory\
  \ it has thrown on the character of the Deity, will it be seen as a single step\
  \ in the evolution of His designs; and long as the time may appear, from the first\
  \ act of our redemption to its final accomplishment, and close and exclusive as\
  \ we may think the attentions of God upon it, it will be found that it has left\
  \ Him room enough for all His concerns; and that, on the high scale of eternity,\
  \ it is but one of those passing and ephemeral transactions which crowd the history\
  \ of a never-ending administration.\u201D\n[2010-03-19]"
