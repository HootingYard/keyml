  \ Halt! Who goes there?\nVoice Offstage\_: I am Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs.\n\
  Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_: You may pass.\nEnter Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs.\
  \ He is dressed in cardboard boxes save for his hat, which is made of birds.\nPerkins,\
  \ Bringer Of Mothballs\_: Have you heard the news from Chappaquiddick?\nSentry At\
  \ The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : Yes. Poor Mary Jo Kopechne.\nPerkins, Bringer Of Mothballs\_\
  : This is a very bijou wasp zoo.\nSentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_: It is. But\
  \ now I have no further words, and nor do you, for there is a fatal flaw in this\
  \ little drama, viz. its incoherence. Now we must simply stand here on stage, silently,\
  \ for several hours, until such time as your hat-birds fly, fly away.\nPerkins,\
  \ Bringer Of Mothballs\_: But they are not living birds. They are stone dead and\
  \ taxidermised.\nSentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_: Did you not hear what I said?\
  \ Hush ye! Hush ye!\nSeveral hours pass, until the audience bursts into thunderous\
  \ applause.\n[2017-02-17]"
