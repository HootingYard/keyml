text: "The marital life of the Grahames became uncosier by the year. \u201CElspeth\
  \ seldom got up before eleven, often went to bed in her clothes \u2026 Much of the\
  \ time she spent on her divan, sipping hot water. She ate practically nothing and\
  \ mouse-nests proliferated in the larder ; she put Kenneth into special underwear\
  \ which was only changed once a year. It is perhaps not surprising that he took\
  \ a long solitary walk every day.\u201D\nJohn Sutherland, The Lives Of The Novelists\
  \ (Profile Books, 2011), quoting from (I think) a 1959 biography of Kenneth Grahame\
  \ by Peter Green.\n[2014-04-28]"
