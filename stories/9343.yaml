text: "When one is covered from head to toe in suppurating boils, one finds that invitations\
  \ to sophisticated cocktail parties, unlike the boils, dry up. I discovered this\
  \ through personal experience. There was a time when, like Job, I was tested by\
  \ the Lord. One such test the Lord devised was to strike me with a plague of boils.\
  \ It could not have come at a worse time, hot on the heels of a plague of locusts,\
  \ an infestation of mice, and a bloody ridiculous gas bill. I wouldn't mind, but\
  \ it's not as if I actually get to see any of the gas unless it is already up in\
  \ flames, burning away. But try telling that to the automaton on the other end of\
  \ the so-called gas helpline. All you get is a flea in your ear. Speaking of which,\
  \ I forgot to mention the plague of fleas. That was another test from the Lord,\
  \ between the locusts and the mice. So I was not best pleased to find myself one\
  \ day completely covered in suppurating boils, particularly when I was due to attend\
  \ a sophisticated cocktail party that very evening.\n\u201CO Lord,\u201D I implored,\
  \ on my knees, \u201CI understand why thee tormentest me so, for I am but a snivelling\
  \ wretch unworthy to crawl upon my belly like a worm or other creeping thing. Having\
  \ said that, could thee perhaps show mercy and remove from my hideous flesh this\
  \ plague of suppurating boils, given that I have received an invitation to attend\
  \ a sophisticated cocktail party this evening and in my present state am barely\
  \ able to present myself in civilised human company?\u201D\nTo which I am afraid\
  \ the Lord replied in a booming authoritarian roar which made the walls tremble.\
  \ I cannot recall His precise words, but the tone was not reassuring. I got the\
  \ distinct impression that He expected me to suffer the boils in silence, with hopeless\
  \ resignation to his Lordly whims, and not to bother Him with pathetic self-pitying\
  \ supplications. So after a while I got to my feet and went out to the chemist's.\n\
  Luckily there were not many people about at this early hour. Those few that did\
  \ see me looked on me with horror, or turned their backs, or shielded their eyes.\
  \ One or two vomited. I cannot say I blamed them, as before leaving the house I\
  \ had checked my appearance in the hallway mirror. I was not a pretty sight. I dressed\
  \ as best as I could, in the few pitiful mice-nibbled rags the Lord had seen fit\
  \ to leave me with, and I wafted a sprig of hyacinths in front of me as I walked,\
  \ to mask as far as possible the stink of the suppurations, which was considerable.\n\
  The chemist and I went back a long way, having been childhood tobogganing pals.\
  \ Indeed, we had even tobogganed as adults, when conditions were right on the slopes,\
  \ and he was able to drag himself away from his dispensary. I knew that he, too,\
  \ had been driven crackers by his gas bills. So I expected a degree of sympathy\
  \ as I pushed open the door and the little bell clanged and he hove into view behind\
  \ his counter.\n\u201CBy Saint Spivack and all the holy martyrs of mediaeval Ravenna!\u201D\
  \ he cried, \u201CYou're a sight for sore eyes!\u201D\nI nodded in agreement, which\
  \ was unwise, as a glob of pus was shaken free from one of my boils and landed on\
  \ the clean scrubbed linoleum of the chemist's shop floor.\n\u201CThe least you\
  \ can do is mop that up,\u201D he said, handing me a mop.\nI did so, while my pal\
  \ rummaged among his pills and potions for a suitable unguent.\n\u201CI can't promise\
  \ this will eradicate your suppurating boils,\u201D he said, handing me a tube of\
  \ Dr Baxter's Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils, Sores, And Buboes,\
  \ \u201CBut it is a cream, and it is a palliative, so in tandem with your sprig\
  \ of hyacinths it might make you a slightly less noisome and offensive creature.\u201D\
  \nI thanked him and paid him and edged carefully out of the door, hoping not to\
  \ leave any further deposits of pus on the linoleum.\n\u201CAre you up for some\
  \ tobogganing come Sunday?\u201D he called after me, which was thoughtful of him,\
  \ but we both knew I could hardly enjoy swooping down a snowy slope aboard a toboggan\
  \ while plagued by suppurating boils.\n\u201CThat is in the hands of the Lord,\u201D\
  \ I replied, and hurried off along the lane towards the canal. I would find a shrubbery-sheltered\
  \ bench somewhere on the towpath and smear my boils with unguent. That, at least,\
  \ was the plan. I was not to know, nor had my pal the chemist seen fit to warn me,\
  \ that Dr Baxter, when concocting his Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils,\
  \ Sores, And Buboes, had used several ingredients which, in combination, proved\
  \ absolutely irresistible to swans. Thus it was that, as I hunkered in the shelter\
  \ of shrubbery, on a bench, smearing my boils, a baker's dozen of swans came padding\
  \ out of the canal and surrounded me. It is one of my iron rules never to antagonise\
  \ a swan, so I tiptoed away as quietly as I could, with only a few of my boils smeared.\
  \ But the swans, driven to delirium by the whiff of Dr Baxter's recipe, pursued\
  \ me. I made it home, and they simply waited outside, occasionally thumping their\
  \ beaks against the front door.\nWhen evening came, and it was time for me to leave\
  \ for the sophisticated cocktail party, the swans were still there. I had no choice\
  \ but to let them follow me, along the lane and past the allotments and through\
  \ the tunnel under the bypass and past the industrial estate and the science park\
  \ and the oil refinery and the other allotments, until I reached the gated community\
  \ wherein the sophisticated cocktail party was taking place. I flashed my permit\
  \ at the security guard in the booth, who depressed the knob which opened the gate.\
  \ I hoped he would shut it again quickly, to keep the swans out, but he seemed to\
  \ think they were my pets, so closely did they tail me. Thus it was that I arrived\
  \ at the sophisticated cocktail party wafting my sprig of hyacinths, covered from\
  \ head to toe in suppurating boils made only slightly less noisome and offensive\
  \ by Dr Baxter's Patent Palliative Cream, and accompanied by a gaggle of delirious\
  \ swans.\nI plucked a drink from a tray and leaned as insouciantly as I could against\
  \ a mantelpiece. I was not a social success. In fact, throughout the evening, the\
  \ only person who came within ten feet of me was a blind flapper with a streaming\
  \ cold which had robbed her of her sense of smell. We were getting on like a house\
  \ on fire until she confessed that she was allergic to swans. I did the gentlemanly\
  \ thing and revealed that there were thirteen swans in close proximity.\n\u201C\
  Ah,\u201D she said, \u201CThat explains why I have developed a splitting headache,\
  \ have a ringing in my ears, and pins and needles in my extremities. I had better\
  \ go out on to the balcony, away from your pet swans, or I am liable to break out\
  \ in suppurating boils all over my body. Toodle-pip!\u201D\n\u201CWait!\u201D, I\
  \ cried, \u201CThe swans are not my pets and I have a half-full tube of Dr Baxter's\
  \ Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils, Sores, And Buboes!\u201D\nBut she\
  \ was already gone.\nA social pariah, I at last realised I had outstayed my welcome,\
  \ and I made my way home, swans in tow. The Lord alone knew when next I would be\
  \ invited to a sophisticated cocktail party, so I got down on my knees and asked\
  \ Him. Back came that booming authoritarian roar. Again, I could not make out the\
  \ individual words, but the tone was if anything even less reassuring than it had\
  \ been in the morning. I headed for bed convinced that those swans were going to\
  \ be following me for the rest of my life. When I opened the bedroom door, there\
  \ they were. They had somehow managed to get into the house, and now they were lined\
  \ up, all thirteen of them, at the foot of the bed, their black eyes gazing at me,\
  \ pitiless, savage, and mad.\n[2012-05-31]"
