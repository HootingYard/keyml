text: 'In Foff lay patches of glue strewn higgledy. Tarps billowed in a gale that
  was never a zephyr. There''s a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza. Crack out
  the canisters of Strontium 90.

  So, at any rate, says weedy poet Dennis Beerpint in his new book, Gibberish From
  An Unalloyed Nitwit. Interviewed by a scribbler next to a filbert hedge, the poet
  was at pains to punctuate his prattle with words beginning with P. But the scribbler''s
  tape recorder malfunctioned, so all record of what Beerpint said is lost, as lost
  as a flea in a jerrycan.

  What we might want to know is where Foff lies, and whether there are fleas there.
  On the other hand, armed with an early morning pint of milk and a copy of The Daily
  Hammer Of Christ, we might prefer to stroll out to where the steamrollers wheeze
  in the dawn light, as milky as the milk in our carton, and sing wassailing songs
  of long ago penned by intoxicated German Fafnirs.

  Beerpint''s bucket did not have a hole in it. In Foff, it rested on a shelf in his
  shed. His shed was precisely twenty times the size of his head. That is how you
  measure sheds, and huts, and cabins, and kiosks. Look at them all lined up, ordered
  by size, in multiples of Beerpint head measurement. Now watch as they are flattened
  by steamrollers.

  Now dip your fingers in those patches of glue. It is glue that will hold things
  together.
