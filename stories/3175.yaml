text: "On the first night, the man with the hammers came a-crashing through my door.\
  \ I immediately identified him as Babinsky.\nOn the second night, the man with the\
  \ hammers, who was not Babinsky after all, summoned men with whisks and men with\
  \ tongs. I tried to reason with them.\nOn the third night, all of them, the man\
  \ with the hammers included, went off on what they called \u201Cnight-time manoeuvres\u201D\
  , and left me alone. I smoked my pipe and listened to the rain.\nOn the fourth night,\
  \ Babinsky himself appeared. This time I think it really was him. He showed me some\
  \ very, very convincing documentation.\nOn the fifth night, the kitchenette was\
  \ flooded with dishwater. Luckily I had plenty of cloths and rags to mop it up.\n\
  On the sixth night, Babinsky and the man with the hammers and the men with whisks\
  \ and the men with tongs sang Christmas carols. Their voices were surprisingly dulcet.\n\
  On the seventh night there was a pox upon my house.\nOn the eighth night I tossed\
  \ and turned and could not sleep. Downstairs, Babinsky & Co were plotting an enormity.\n\
  On the ninth night they all went off to commit the enormity. I hid in a cubby so\
  \ they would not take me with them. It was a tiny cubby and I became cramped.\n\
  On the tenth night, there was an important hockey match on television. I have never\
  \ understood the rules of hockey, so I could not understand what Babinsky and the\
  \ man with the hammers were so het up about.\nOn the eleventh night, I suddenly\
  \ realised that the men with whisks and the men with tongs had never returned after\
  \ committing the enormity. It also occurred to me that I had not read a word about\
  \ the enormity in the Daily Shovel.\nOn twelfth night I took stock, and I peeled\
  \ potatoes. I peeled potatoes and I peeled potatoes. By the light of the silvery\
  \ moon I peeled potatoes, and then I peeled potatoes.\n[2009-09-22]"
