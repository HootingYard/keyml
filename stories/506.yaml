text: "Much has been written, in the past, by people who knew of these things, about\
  \ the knitting of knots. Knots, we learn, have been knit from cord and twine and\
  \ rope and string and wool, among other materials. While it is true that more knots\
  \ have been tied rather than not, without the aid of knitting needles, it remains\
  \ the case that the knitted knot has its own special place in our hearts, whether\
  \ our hearts flutter like a bird's or a squirrel's heart, or pound like a drum.\
  \ For with the knitted knot we see a true craft, whereas it can be argued that the\
  \ mere tying of knots, while sometimes requiring deftness and digital agility, can\
  \ as well be done by a brute in a hurry. Not so the knitted knot.\nHurrying brutes,\
  \ particularly those whose tails thump upon the ground as they rush headlong to\
  \ the scene of their next enormity, are most unlikely to have the patience and wit\
  \ necessary for the knitting of a knot. Nor are their paws likely to be dexterous\
  \ enough to handle knitting needles, or even crochet hooks. Crochet is not knitting,\
  \ of course, and the crocheted knot is a different creature to the knitted knot,\
  \ and one with its own literature, exemplars, and paragons.\nThere exist pattern\
  \ books containing instructions for knitting knots, and depictions of knots so knitted,\
  \ but it would be a mistake to think that one needs such a pattern before embarking\
  \ upon the knitting of a knot. Some of the finest knitted knots have been the work\
  \ of improvisers, brave, adventurous souls who begin to knit with no other aim in\
  \ mind than the knitting of a knot, its final form unimagined, not even a blurred\
  \ wisp in the mind's eye of the knitter.\nEven improv knot knitters, however, need\
  \ a degree of foresight, for they will wish to avoid the act of knitting being interrupted\
  \ by a hurrying brute. Such interruptions can prove fatal, if not to the knitter\
  \ then almost certainly to the knot. A brute in a hurry, coming upon a knitter,\
  \ will tear and shred and rip and rend, all the while roaring its brute cries as\
  \ its tail thumps the ground. Thus the knitter of knots is advised, in many of these\
  \ books of the past, to find a secluded haven in which to knit. To be hidden behind\
  \ a clump of brambles, or snug in a concealed nook in a cave, or safe behind the\
  \ ramparts of a mighty and towering fortress, each of these has been recommended.\
  \ A knitter's choice of refuge will depend to some extent on the nature of the brutes\
  \ who hurry through the lands in which they knit. There are single brutes who roam\
  \ alone, and pairs, and occasionally trios, but by far the most common, and the\
  \ most frightening, are those who hurry about in packs.\nVarious writers have pointed\
  \ out that the knitter of knots can use the knots they have knitted as part of the\
  \ apparatus to bind and immobilise a hurrying brute. This is undoubtedly true, but\
  \ these same writers tend to neglect the inconvenient fact that, before such binding\
  \ and immobilising and judicious use of knitted knots can occur, the hurrying brute\
  \ must first be overpowered. In most cases, at least those cases that bear examination,\
  \ the overpowering of a brute in a hurry requires inhuman strength, and the kind\
  \ of musculature rarely found in the average knot knitter. Even more important,\
  \ then, to ensure that before the very first clack of needle against needle, the\
  \ knitter has located a place of safety in which to knit.\nPerhaps the finest of\
  \ the books I chanced upon when researching this article is actually more a pamphlet\
  \ than a book proper. It is How To Knit Knots While Remaining Invisible To Hurrying\
  \ Brutes by Dobson (out of print), and contains a plethora of terrific mezzotints\
  \ by the mezzotintist Rex Tint. Dobson claims to have invented a so-called \u201C\
  enshrouding spectral ether-cloak\u201D which, when activated, renders the knot knitter\
  \ invisible, thus obviating the need for a time-consuming search for clumps of brambles,\
  \ nooks in caves, or mighty and towering fortresses. It also silences the clack\
  \ of knitting needles, or at least drowns out the clack, by generating a noise like\
  \ the buzzing of a million hornets, audible only to a brute hurrying past, its tail\
  \ thumping the ground. I suspect that Dobson's \u201Ccloak\u201D is wholly spurious,\
  \ but the pamphlet is worth it for the mezzotints alone.\n[2008-08-10]"
