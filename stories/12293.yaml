text: "My grassy knoll potsage the other day prompted a keen-eyed reader to bring\
  \ to my attention something called Project Unspeakable. According to its Facecloth\
  \ page, this \u201Cproject\u201D aims to \u201Cchallenge the silence surrounding\
  \ the assassination\u201D of President Kennedy and three other \u201Cleaders for\
  \ peace\u201D (Robert Kennedy, Dr King (as we must always call him), and Malcolm\
  \ X).\nEr \u2026 what silence is that, precisely? There are so many books about\
  \ the JFK assassination that even Vincent Bugliosi hasn't had time\u2014in the twenty-plus\
  \ years he worked on his book\u2014to read all of them. Not to mention the magazine\
  \ articles, television documentaries, and feature films. The deaths of the other\
  \ three have not attracted quite that level of attention, but they have hardly been\
  \ ignored and cast into the dustbin of history (\xA9\_Leon Trotsky, another murderee\
  \ who surely ought to be on Project Unspeakable's list. Oh, hang on, he wasn't American,\
  \ and he was ice-picked by a Stalinist agent, so in Unspeakable circles that's probably\
  \ all above board.)\nThe \u201Cconspiracy of silence\u201D is about as silent as\
  \ Hooting Yard, which as you know hardly ever shuts up.\n[2014-01-20]"
