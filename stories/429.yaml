text: "Today is the one hundredth anniversary of the Great Emblotchment. There were\
  \ countless other emblotchments throughout our history, but the one we commemorate\
  \ today was of a blotchy magnitude well above those other emblotchments.\nIt all\
  \ started in a commercial laundry on Pudding Boulevard. A man named Pim\u2014who\
  \ may or may not have been related to the late Francis Pym, Foreign Secretary from\
  \ 1982 to 1983 \u2013 was bundling some towels into a basket when he noticed that\
  \ one of the towels had been subjected to emblotchment. A man of piercing eyesight,\
  \ a bit like Ray Milland in The Man With X-Ray Eyes (1963) but obviously not quite\
  \ as piercing as that, Pim was able at a glance to divine the cause of the emblotchment,\
  \ and it sent him into a panic. He scampered up the staircase from the laundry to\
  \ street level, and ran the length of Pudding Boulevard waving the emblotched towel\
  \ in the air. Thus microscopic blotchy bits were released into the atmosphere, invisible\
  \ but none the less blotchy.\nThe authorities acted with admirable speed. Pim was\
  \ carted off to a mysterious institute hidden behind trees in the countryside, the\
  \ sort of place that would later become familiar to viewers of the 1960s television\
  \ series The Avengers. He was placed in isolation and fitted with a metal helmet\
  \ wired up to bleeping consoles. The emblotched towel was torn from his grasp and\
  \ sent to another mysterious institute in the countryside to be analysed by trained\
  \ emblotchment analysts. Meanwhile, Pudding Boulevard was cordoned off with what\
  \ at the time was an entirely new cordoning technique. A controlled explosion destroyed\
  \ the laundry and its neighbouring buildings, and the rubble was taken away by over\
  \ fifty horse-drawn carts and tossed down a pit. It was not a bottomless pit, but\
  \ the nearest thing to a bottomless pit that could be identified at short notice.\
  \ When the last bit of rubble was thrown down it, the pit opening was covered with\
  \ layers of cement over which a rich, loamy soil was scattered, and lupins and primroses\
  \ were planted there. A similar operation was carried out on the site of the laundry,\
  \ except that hollyhocks and hyacinths were planted instead of lupins and primroses.\
  \ There were compelling reasons for this.\nBefore the day was out, big pumps were\
  \ moved into position at either end of Pudding Boulevard, and the air was sucked\
  \ into them, deblotched, and pumped back out. Thousands of starlings were lured\
  \ to flock over the laundry site and kept there by a magnetic barrier. They were\
  \ monitored by a team of top ornithologists in a lead-lined cabin just beyond the\
  \ Boulevard, around which a flowerbed was dug and planted with geraniums and wisteria.\
  \ At nightfall, volunteers from Pang Hill Orphanage were sent to scurry through\
  \ the cordoned-off area and, as soon as they emerged, were tested for emblotchment\
  \ in a hastily-rigged up lab the floors of which were strewn with lilies and petunias.\n\
  As we know, none of this hectic activity succeeded in stopping the emblotchment.\
  \ Not only were the starlings and orphans and top ornithologists emblotched, so\
  \ too were the gardeners who planted the lupins and primroses and hollyhocks and\
  \ hyacinths and geraniums and wisteria. Soon everything was emblotched, and I mean\
  \ absolutely everything. Even the stars in their heavens, the outer planets, the\
  \ gas giants, all succumbed to what is rightly called the Great Emblotchment. And\
  \ exactly one year later, on the fifteenth of May 1909, the actor James Mason was\
  \ born in Huddersfield. Some see this as a coincidence, but those of us who have\
  \ studied such things see deeper patterns, patterns not unlike the embroidered curlicues\
  \ on the towel that Pim waved as he dashed frantically down Pudding Boulevard and\
  \ let loose the Great Emblotchment, one hundred years ago today.\n[2008-05-15]"
