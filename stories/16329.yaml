text: "We were camping in the oasis. We were in one of those so-called \u201Cnew tents\u201D\
  \ championed by the \u201Cnew campers\u201D. The new camping movement took its inspiration\
  \ partly from the Kibbo Kift and partly from an obscure B-side of a 45rpm single\
  \ by The Captain And Tennille, in which the winsome duo sang of the joys of \u201C\
  new camping in our new tent with our new camping-gaz stove\u201D. Though we had\
  \ a new tent, unfortunately we did not have a new camping-gaz stove, and had to\
  \ make do with an old one to cook our sausages.\nMy two companions were soilheads,\
  \ but I am not a trendy person, and I still own\u2014and use\u2014a comb.\nOne day,\
  \ peering out through the new flap of our new tent, we saw, passing by in the near\
  \ distance, an Arab, leading a jackal on a leash.\n\u201CHey there!\u201D called\
  \ out one of my companions, let us call him Soilhead One, \u201CCome over here with\
  \ your leashed jackal and share our cocoa and sausages!\u201D\nAs he approached,\
  \ we saw that the Arab was an old man, much bewrinkled, and creaking.\n\u201CYou\
  \ are very kind,\u201D he said, \u201CThough I am old, my jackal here is one of\
  \ those so-called \u2018new jackals\u2019 we've been hearing so much about lately.\u201D\
  \nWe confessed that we had heard not a jot about new jackals.\n\u201CWell,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CThe mobile library will be stopping by this oasis on Thursday morning.\
  \ They should have in stock the latest issue of Stuff Occurring In The Desert magazine.\
  \ In it, you will find a feature article about new jackals. A short while ago one\
  \ of its reporters interviewed me, and the Muhammadan mezzotintist Dot Al-Tint executed\
  \ a mezzotint of my jackal. I was given to understand the picture will appear on\
  \ the magazine's cover.\u201D\nWe promised to consult a copy on the coming Thursday,\
  \ and reasoned that any questions we might have about old and new jackals could\
  \ wait until then. There was a lull in the conversation. We chewed our sausages\
  \ and slurped our cocoa.\nThis would be an opportune time to tell you something\
  \ about Soilhead Two. When we set out on our desert crossing, he was a complete\
  \ stranger to both me and Soilhead One. We had encountered him at a souk. He used\
  \ to wear fedoras, but now he sported a fez. There were kabbalistic innuendos in\
  \ everything he said. A soilhead in a fez was quite a novelty, even at that time.\
  \ Soilhead One, who knew more than most about the Kabbalah, was able to untangle\
  \ the innuendoes to some extent.\nSoilhead Two told us very little about himself.\
  \ Growing exasperated by our questions, he conceded eventually that there was an\
  \ entry for him in the Dictionary of National Biography. That, he said, would tell\
  \ us all we needed to know about him, and more. It was Soilhead One, sharp as a\
  \ tack, who countered that one needs to be dead before one can be included in the\
  \ DNB. In reply, Soilhead Two looked up at the sky, pointed, and said \u201COh look,\
  \ a [common name of a type of bird I am afraid I have forgotten]!\u201D As ever,\
  \ ornithology served to distract us, and the subject of Soilhead Two's life\u2014\
  and possible death\u2014was never raised again.\nNow, in the lull outside our \u201C\
  new tent\u201D at the oasis, we noticed that Soilhead Two was staring fixedly at\
  \ the jackal, and the jackal was staring fixedly at Soilhead Two. Were they just\
  \ gazing at each other, or were they communicating by some telepathic means akin\
  \ to that employed by Mr Spock in the television series Star Trek?\nWhatever was\
  \ going on between them came to an abrupt end when the Arab, tugging on the jackal's\
  \ leash, explained that he had important sand-based things to do elsewhere in the\
  \ desert, and must be on his way. He thanked us for the cocoa and sausages, reminded\
  \ us to read up on \u201Cnew jackals\u201D in Stuff Occurring In The Desert magazine,\
  \ and trudged creakily away, jackal in tow.\nA few days passed without incident.\
  \ Soilhead Two seemed strangely quiet, but we noticed he was growing increasingly\
  \ irritated with our old camping-gaz stove. Then, on Wednesday, the day before the\
  \ mobile library was due, he announced that he knew of a large desert department\
  \ store where we would be able to buy one of the \u201Cnew\u201D stoves. Soilhead\
  \ One and I had no reason to suspect him of ill intent, so we happily packed up\
  \ our things and set off across the sand, letting Soilhead Two lead the way.\nWe\
  \ marched across the boiling sands for the best part of a day, until, towards nightfall,\
  \ we arrived at an airstrip. There were no aeroplanes, no control tower, and nor\
  \ was there a department store. Soilhead Two walked determinedly along the strip,\
  \ and came to a halt at a gaping pit. Baffled, we watched him carefully as he began\
  \ to wave his arms in strange slow significant passing movements over the pit, while\
  \ babbling guttural incantatory mumbo jumbo.\nSuddenly, a plume of black smoke belched\
  \ forth from the pit, and we were amazed to see, stepping out of it, the old Arab.\
  \ He no longer had a jackal on a leash. Unnervingly, his own head was that of a\
  \ jackal.\n\u201CAll hail Anubis!\u201D cried Soilhead Two.\n\u201CGreetings, Mr\
  \ Crowley,\u201D barked Anubis.\n\u201CPlease, call me Aleister,\u201D said the\
  \ man we had thought our \u201Cnew camping\u201D companion.\n\u201CVery well, Aleister.\
  \ I see, standing behind you, a couple of nitwits.\u201D\n\u201CYes, O great Anubis,\
  \ I thought it would be fun to make of them a sacrifice to the powers of Darkness,\
  \ Death, Doom, Despair, and Destruction.\u201D\n\u201CThat's a great idea, Aleister,\
  \ But wait!\u201D\nAnd the jackal-headed god made strange slow significant passing\
  \ movements of his own, and out of the pit came leaping and bounding dozens upon\
  \ dozens of savage yapping jackals.\n\u201CLet us push your little pals into the\
  \ pit until we have prepared ourselves for the full awfulness of the sacrifice,\u201D\
  \ said the god.\nAnd so Soilhead One and I were pushed into the pit. That was six\
  \ days ago. We can hear Aleister Crowley and Anubis assembling their horrible equipment.\
  \ We have no chance of escape. Above us, in a ring around the pit, are the jackals.\
  \ They are barking and yapping and slavering and gazing down on us. And how they\
  \ hate us!\nThe first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by\
  \ Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-03-11]"
