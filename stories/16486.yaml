  Ever since it ended, after eight seasons, in 2012, fans of the television comedy-drama
  Desperate Housewives have been hoping for a sequel. Now it appears their prayers
  have been answered. Next month sees the launch of a brand new television comedy-drama
  called Disparate Horseflies.

  Set on a horse named Wisteria, the show features the amusing and sometimes not so
  amusing antics of a group of horseflies who live, parasitically, upon its shanks,
  withers, fetlocks, and other parts of a horse which I am sure you can list for yourselves.
  As the title implies, the flies are a varied bunch, apart from their all being flies
  of the horsefly family (Tabanus sulcifrons).

  The cast comprises several actual horseflies, specially trained to act by tiptop
  thespian fly-trainer Cedric Flytrain. For the setting of Wisteria, an elegant if
  tubercular horse named Keith, resident at a stables in Vileshire, was employed.

  Preview tapes have not been made available, but word has it that the first episode
  includes close-up scenes of grotesque horsefly behaviour which some viewers, and
  horses, may find absolutely sickening.
