text: "I had always yearned to walk in the shoes of the fisherman. First I had to\
  \ persuade the fisherman to give me his shoes, or at least to lend them to me. But\
  \ he was a surly and cantankerous fellow, as fishermen often are, especially when\
  \ trafficking with landlubbers, and I certainly lubbed the land. In fact, it was\
  \ precisely my lubbing of the land that made me long to walk in the shoes of the\
  \ fisherman. I reasoned\u2014acutely, I think\u2014that wearing a fisherman's shoes\
  \ while walking about peering at birds, I could broaden my landbound lub by attuning\
  \ myself to the denizens of the deep (fish) and those whose domain was the sky (birds).\
  \ It might be argued that simply wearing a fisherman's shoes was no match for plunging\
  \ into the briny depths and swimming about with all those myriad befinned creatures\
  \ below, but I am a cautious man, and I did not wish to run before I could walk,\
  \ as it were, though that is possibly not the best analogy to make.\nIt has been\
  \ my experience that most people are open to bribery by herring, but this ploy would\
  \ obviously not work with a fisherman. By following him about for several weeks,\
  \ and closely questioning his local kiosk-owner, I discovered that the fisherman\
  \ had an unquenchable thirst for Squelcho! Using my underworld contacts, I was able\
  \ to obtain half a dozen bumper multipacks of the canned fizzy drink, and one morning,\
  \ shortly after he had returned from a night-fishing expedition, I loaded the cans\
  \ on to a cart and trundled it down to the foul and reeking wharf where I knew the\
  \ fisherman liked to lollop about.\nHe proved to be a very canny fisherman, and\
  \ drove a hard bargain, but eventually agreed to let me borrow his shoes until midday,\
  \ on the understanding that I would then bring him a further half dozen multipacks\
  \ of Squelcho! I had no intention of submitting to such extortion, but nodded agreement.\
  \ I would worry about the consequences of reneging on the deal later. For your edification,\
  \ I wanted to reproduce a verbatim transcript of our exchange at this point. Unfortunately,\
  \ the tape I made, on a cassette recorder concealed in my bomber jacket, was wiped\
  \ later that morning when I was engulfed in a terrific electrical storm (see below).\n\
  And so I set out to walk in the shoes of the fisherman, and to look at birds in\
  \ the sky. I had not counted on the happenstance that the fisherman's feet were\
  \ several sizes smaller than mine. Walking in his shoes was an agony, but I persevered,\
  \ repeating my mantra \u201CI am not a milksop! I am not a milksop!\u201D. I walked\
  \ in the shoes of the fisherman away from the wharf and over Sawdust Bridge and\
  \ along Yoko Ono Boulevard and past the important roadworks at the Blister Lane\
  \ Bypass and through the Acre of Mud and along the perimeter fence of Poxhaven Aerodrome\
  \ and under the viaduct and up, up into the Blue Forgotten Hills. All the while\
  \ I was keenly watching the skies, and I saw several birds.\nThe first was about\
  \ 5.7 inches long, with a wingspan of roughly 9.6 to 11.2 inches and a weight somewhere\
  \ between 0.63 and 1.02 ounces. It had a black forehead and a blue-grey crown, nape\
  \ and upper mantle. The rump was a light olive-green, and the lower mantle and scapulars\
  \ formed a brown saddle. The side of the head, throat and breast were a dull rust-red\
  \ merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers\
  \ were dark grey with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail was black apart\
  \ from the two outer feathers on each side which had white wedges. Each wing had\
  \ a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a buff-white bar on the secondaries\
  \ and inner primaries The flight feathers were black with white on the basal portions\
  \ of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries had pale yellow fringes on the\
  \ outer web whereas the outer primaries had a white outer edge. My ornithological\
  \ education had been brought to a premature end because of the war, but I knew a\
  \ linnet when I saw one. I jotted down \u201Clinnet\u201D in my birdbook, together\
  \ with a note of the date and the weather and the fact that I could barely think\
  \ straight due to the stabbing pains in my feet, shod in the fisherman's shoes.\
  \ I tucked the birdbook back into my pocket and screamed \u201CI am not a milksop!\u201D\
  \ several times at the top of my voice.\nShortly afterwards I had to take the birdbook\
  \ out again because I spotted a second bird. This one was larger than a European\
  \ robin, and it had a white rump and tail, with a black inverted T-pattern at the\
  \ end of the tail. Its plumage\u2014plumage!\u2014had grey upperparts, buff throat\
  \ and black wings and a face mask. It had a whistling, crackly song, and its call\
  \ was a typical \u201Cchat chack\u201D noise, just the the same as its flight call.\
  \ Cursing the war that put paid to my avian studies, I wrote \u201Cbunting\u201D\
  \ in my birdbook, and added a brief pen-portrait of the fisherman whose shoes I\
  \ was walking in, with increasing difficulty, and much anguish.\nThe third bird\
  \ I saw that day, up in the sky above the Blue Forgotten Hills, was about 7 inches\
  \ long, weighed roughly 1.1 to 1.4 ounces, and displayed a light green body colour\
  \ (abdomen and rumps), while its mantles (back and wing coverts) displayed pitch-black\
  \ mantle markings edged in clear yellow undulations. The forehead and face were\
  \ yellow with blackish stripes down to the cere. It displayed small, purple cheek\
  \ patches and a series of three black spots across each side of its throat (called\
  \ throat spots). The two outermost throat spots were situated at the base of each\
  \ cheek patch. The tail was cobalt (dark-blue); and outside tail feathers displayed\
  \ central yellow flashes. Its wings had greenish-black flight feathers and black\
  \ coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes. Its bill was olive\
  \ grey and its legs blueish-grey, with zygodactyl toes. I scribbled down \u201C\
  nightjar\u201D in my birdbook, and collapsed to the ground, memories of bombs and\
  \ artillery fire in my head and excruciating spasms of agony surging through my\
  \ feet. I took off the shoes of the fisherman and made my way back to the wharf\
  \ in my socks.\nThe fisherman was sitting on an upturned barrel, surrounded by drained\
  \ and crushed Squelcho! cans. As I approached him, swinging his shoes by their laces,\
  \ I realised I had not yet thought up a stratagem to avoid having to pay him off\
  \ with another half dozen bumper multipacks of his favourite fizzy drink. But as\
  \ things turned out, I did not have to, for of a sudden we were engulfed in a terrific\
  \ electrical storm (see above). I escaped unscathed, probably due to the stylishly\
  \ conical gutta-percha hat atop my head. But my cassette tape was wiped, and the\
  \ fisherman was struck by lightning, several times, and, quaking like a jelly, toppled\
  \ off his barrel, and over the edge of the wharf, and into the sloshing sea, into\
  \ which he sank, remorselessly, emitting squelchy sparks, remorselessly.\nI tossed\
  \ his shoes into the water. They were no good to me, being far too small. But I\
  \ had walked in the shoes of the fisherman, observing birds in the sky, so I had\
  \ succeeded in realising one of my greatest ambitions. A lubber of land, I had communed,\
  \ simultaneously, with creatures of sea and sky.\nOnly later, back at home, glugging\
  \ from a can of Squelcho! and browsing in an illustrated treatise upon birds, did\
  \ I learn that I had seen neither a linnet nor a bunting nor a nightjar. The birds\
  \ I had spotted were a chaffinch and a wheatear and a budgerigar. Clearly there\
  \ was only one thing to do. I would have to fish the shoes of the fisherman out\
  \ of the wharfside water, and cram my feet back into them, and go walking again,\
  \ away from the wharf and over Sawdust Bridge and along Yoko Ono Boulevard and past\
  \ the important roadworks at the Blister Lane Bypass and through the Acre of Mud\
  \ and along the perimeter fence of Poxhaven Aerodrome and under the viaduct and\
  \ up, up, up into the Blue Forgotten Hills, looking at birds in the sky, this time\
  \ writing their proper names in my birdbook, all the while walking in the shoes\
  \ of the fisherman.\n[2015-04-22]"
