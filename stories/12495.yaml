text: "For a study of Binder's forty-nine symphonies, see here.\nBinder wrote two\
  \ piano concertos. The first, Piano Concerto In B Flat On A Theme Of Glinka, was\
  \ for many years, too many to count, thought to be based on a theme by the Russian\
  \ composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka (1804\u20131857). Scholars pored over his scores,\
  \ trying to find the theme which had inspired Binder, in vain.\nThe mystery was\
  \ solved when a researcher found a scribbled note in the margin of a newspaper cutting\
  \ at the bottom of a box of Binder's miscellaneous papers. The discovery, incidentally,\
  \ happened on the very day of a different discovery, when Pickles, a black and white\
  \ Collie, rooting about in a suburban hedge in Beulah Hill, South Norwood, found\
  \ the Jules Rimet trophy which had been stolen four months before the start of the\
  \ 1966 World Cup foopball tournament. Pickles\u2019 owner received a financial reward;\
  \ the only reward gained by the finder of the marginal scribble was the undying\
  \ gratitude of Binder enthusiasts.\nWhat the note revealed was the true identity\
  \ of Glinka. This was not the Russian composer, but an affectionate nickname given\
  \ to the landlady of the dilapidated seaside boarding house where Binder lived during\
  \ a particularly wretched decade. Glinka was rakishly thin and angular and had a\
  \ certain corvine air, and she whistled while she worked. One of her whistlings\
  \ enchanted the impecunious composer. He may even have intended the tribute of a\
  \ piano concerto to mollify Glinka and stop her bashing relentlessly on his door\
  \ every day demanding the rent, which Binder always had great difficulty cobbling\
  \ together. He was making a living at the time as a seaside resort piano tuner,\
  \ in a seaside resort with few pianos.\nGlinka's whistle must have been something\
  \ to hear. The Piano Concerto certainly is, though you will probably want to wear\
  \ ear-muffs. It's that kind of concerto.\nBinder's second piano concerto, the Piano\
  \ Concerto In B Flat On A Theme Of Glinka Again, is a very different work. One critic,\
  \ whose ears were pretty fantastic as critical ears go, said that it was hard to\
  \ believe it was the work of the same composer. Where the first concerto is redolent\
  \ of marshland and biscuits, the second has a sort of guttersnipe snippiness. Where\
  \ the first is piquant, the second chunters. The theme itself is rendered by the\
  \ sizzling of sausages in a frying pan, which was possibly an allusion by the composer\
  \ to Glinka's impossibly greasy breakfasts. At the premi\xE8re of the work, in Pointy\
  \ Town's pointy town hall, the overenthusiastic sausage sizzler allowed spitting\
  \ fat to set fire to the trousers of the brass section, next to which he was stationed\
  \ with his Calor Gaz picnic hob. The performance ended in disarray and the insistent\
  \ ringing of alarms and the arrival of fire engines, elements which Binder planned\
  \ to incorporate into a third piano concerto. He never completed this work. Actually,\
  \ he never even started it. He fell hopelessly in love with the flapper Poopsie\
  \ Clutterbuck who was allergic to pianos, and who convinced Binder to concentrate\
  \ on his symphonies, bagatelles, and threnodies.\nGlinka's dilapidated seaside boarding\
  \ house fell into further dilapidation. The landlady sold it to a simple-minded\
  \ fool, and retired to a different seaside resort, further along the coast, where\
  \ she was often to be seen tottering along the pier, supported on sticks, her whistling\
  \ drowned out by the ferocious shrieking of gulls and gales.\n[2014-03-14]"
