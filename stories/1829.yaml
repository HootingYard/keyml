text: "Three years ago, I drew your attention to William Hope Hodgson, a strangely\
  \ compelling writer. To see that post, go to the archive here, and scroll down to\
  \ February 13th and Breakfast Of Hideousness!\nI have just read Hodgson's 1909 novel\
  \ The Ghost Pirates, and though I could witter on about its peculiarities of narration,\
  \ language, and even punctuation, there is one particular point that struck me and\
  \ which I wish to share with you. Note that the copy I was reading was a first edition.\
  \ On page 181 we find this:\nThe ropes were foul of one another in a regular \u2018\
  bunch o\u2019 buffers.\u2019 *\nThe asterisk alerts us to the following footnote:\n\
  * Modified from the original.\nWhat in the name of heaven can this mean? What was\
  \ the original version of \u2018bunch o\u2019 buffers\u2019? Why was it modified?\
  \ This being the first edition, \u2018the original\u2019 must presumably refer to\
  \ the manuscript. Is it the only change from the manuscript to find its way into\
  \ the printed book? And why tell us, in any case, given that if we were not told\
  \ we would never know?\nI am both perplexed and inspired by this footnote. My perplexity\
  \ I have explained, my inspiration is something readers may well encounter at Hooting\
  \ Yard in the near future\u2014the inexplicable or paradoxical or gratuitous or\
  \ tangential or bonkers or winsome or wilful footnote.\n[2009-02-17]"
