text: "\nGood evening, and thank you for your warm welcome. Well, warm-ish. The clapping\
  \ petered out rather quickly, and I must say that other audiences, in other auditoria,\
  \ have shown a sight more enthusiasm. But there we go. I am not complaining. This\
  \ lecturing lark is much preferable to being out and about in all weathers in the\
  \ company of sheep, dim-witted and fearful beasts that they are. It is more lucrative\
  \ too.\nBut I should introduce myself. My name is Bo Peep. I am often known as \u201C\
  Little\u201D Bo Peep by dint of my diminutive stature. I don't mind being called\
  \ \u201CLittle\u201D. It has an affectionate ring. But I do object when some newspapers\
  \ compare me to a dwarf from a Wagner opera. Clearly, the organisers of tonight's\
  \ event expected me to be smaller than I am. What a tiny lectern!\nThe one thing\
  \ most of you will know about me is that I lost my sheep. I do not deny it. Quite\
  \ why it caused such a kerfuffle in the press is a mystery to me. I became the poster\
  \ girl for neglectful and inept shepherdesses, and even now I can barely leave my\
  \ cottage without some mucky little country urchin calling out to me to ask where\
  \ my sheep are. It is a trying existence.\nThus I welcome this opportunity to tell\
  \ my side of the story. It all happened on one of those blustery misty wuthery weathery\
  \ days, in some godawful rustic backwater. As usual, I was sitting in a field, supervising\
  \ several sheep. My childhood ambition of intergalactic space travel, of boldly\
  \ going where no Peep had gone before, seemed as far off as ever. Bored out of my\
  \ considerably acute mind, I drifted into a doze. And as I dozed, I dreamed.\nI\
  \ dreamt of the moon and a yew tree. The light was blue. Grasses prickled my ankles,\
  \ and I simply could not see where to get to through the fumy, spiritous mists.\
  \ The moon dragged the sea after it like a dark crime. Bells startled the sky, eight\
  \ great tongues affirming the Resurrection bonged out their names. The yew tree\
  \ pointed up. It had a Gothic shape. The moon was my mother. Her blue garments unloosed\
  \ small bats and owls. She was bald and wild. The message of the yew tree was blackness,\
  \ blackness and silence. I started awake, rubbed my eyes, and saw that the sheep\
  \ I was meant to be shepherdessing were gone.\nMy immediate hunch was that they\
  \ had been abducted by a band of roaming Wagnerian dwarves. I had read of several\
  \ such crimes in the Daily Nibelungenlied And Countryside Advertiser. So, with the\
  \ gung ho approach for which we Peeps are universally admired, or if not universally\
  \ then at least in and around Sibodnedabshire, I hoisted my crook and marched off\
  \ to the newsagent's kiosk, under those pollarded willows by the canal just before\
  \ the level crossing at Ketchworth.\nIt was not the Advertiser I was looking for.\
  \ It so happened that this newsagent kept in stock various seventeenth-century tracts,\
  \ including Dagons-Downfall; or The great IDOL digged up Root and Branch by Roger\
  \ Crabb, A Fiery Flying Roll by Abiezer Coppe, and The Neck of the Quakers Broken\
  \ by Lodowicke Muggleton. The one I wanted\u2014obviously\u2014was The Lost Sheep\
  \ Found by Laurence Clarkson. After a close reading of this pamphlet, I felt sure\
  \ I would be able to locate my sheep, and they would no longer be lost.\nI purchased\
  \ a copy and repaired to a bosky arbour to read it. I had barely digested the opening\
  \ paragraph when I was set upon by a vulgar mechanic. He was a repellent and vile\
  \ and filthy fellow, not unlike a Wagnerian dwarf, though considerably taller. I\
  \ cried \u201CUnhand me, sir!\u201D, and smashed him in the face with my shepherdess's\
  \ crook, neatly breaking his jaw. \u201CWoe betide those who mess with a Peep!\u201D\
  \ I added, kicking him in the head as he lay sprawled and whimpering beneath a plum\
  \ tree's slender shade. Above us, in the shining summer heaven, there was a cloud\
  \ my eyes dwelled long upon. It was quite white and very high above us, then I looked\
  \ up and found that it had gone, just like my sheep.\nIn the course of bashing up\
  \ the vulgar mechanic, I had inadvertently dropped my seventeenth century tract\
  \ into a puddle, and not just any puddle, no siree, but a muddy puddle, the muddiest\
  \ of muddy puddles it had ever been my misfortune in which to inadvertently drop\
  \ a seventeenth century tract. Laurence Clarkson's timeless sheep-finding words\
  \ were rendered wholly illegible. What was a poor Peep to do?\nIt was at this point,\
  \ just as I was venting my vehemence upon the sprawled mechanic by biffing him several\
  \ more times with my crook, that I heard distant baas. Now, in my experience as\
  \ a shepherdess in and around Sibodnedwabshire, this sound could mean only one thing.\
  \ It meant there were sheep in the distance!\nLike a mad thing, I galumphed towards\
  \ the sound of baas, and as I approached, I spotted, fleeing, a band of Wagnerian\
  \ dwarves. It may have been the sight of me bearing down on them with my crook that\
  \ caused them to scamper so swiftly away. More likely, I think, is that they had\
  \ belatedly realised the unutterable tedium occasioned by the company of sheep.\n\
  It is a tedium I know well. Or, should I say, knew well. For the unexpected outcome\
  \ of my notoriety as an inept shepherdess who loses her sheep is that not a single\
  \ farmer will any longer entrust me with his flock. At first, this was a harrowing\
  \ turn of events. I fell into penury and need. But as my story spread, and songs\
  \ were sung about me, so infamy uncurdled into fame. I began to be invited on to\
  \ television chat shows, notably an appearance on Russell Harty Plus. Colour supplements\
  \ published fawning profiles of me, all warts removed. Now, with these lecture tours,\
  \ I am raking it in. And I don't mean the sort of peasant raking that the likes\
  \ of Huw Halfbacon are doomed to for eternity, in an eerie ever-repeating cycle\
  \ of fate. No, I am raking in the moolah-boolah, and soon I hope to have saved enough\
  \ to realise my childhood ambition, and be the first Peep in outer space, lost,\
  \ like my sheep, but unlike them lost in the stars, lost out here in the stars.\
  \ little stars, big stars, blowing through the night, and I'm lost out here in the\
  \ stars \u2026\n[2017-10-03]"
