text: "I am very pleased to announce that the latest episode in the Grizzled Old Fool\
  \ series of multi-platform cultural interventions has been released. Grizzled Old\
  \ Fool At The Haberdashery sees the grizzled old fool going to a haberdashery to\
  \ buy buttons and cloth and pins. As usual, he is chewing a plug of tobacco and\
  \ wearing his trademark battered old hat. He behaves ineptly in the haberdashery,\
  \ piddling in his trousers and overturning a display stand of thread samples. In\
  \ a particularly poignant moment, he is mistaken for Mark E Smith of The Fall and\
  \ prevailed upon to sing an extempore version of \u201CCity Hobgoblins\u201D to\
  \ the haberdasher's excited children.\nMuch attention is given to the purpose to\
  \ which the grizzled old fool intends to put his purchases. Buttons, cloth, and\
  \ pins are hardly the kinds of things we expect to see deployed by our hero, who\
  \ we are more used to seeing traipsing between his shack and his outdoor privy,\
  \ shouting at the sky. He does plenty of shouting in the haberdashery, at nobody\
  \ in particular, and he also leaves a trail of drool upon the countertop.\nWhen\
  \ the haberdasher eventually calls the police, the grizzled old fool is bundled\
  \ onto the back of their cart and ferried to the riverside police station. Cruelly,\
  \ they shove him into the river, not realising that he is of course amphibious,\
  \ like unto a toad. Happily splashing about in the water, the grizzled old fool\
  \ makes his way to the opposite bank. He clambers ashore and pops into a chemist's\
  \ shop where he buys some bandages, a bottle of mouthwash, and the boiled head of\
  \ a goat. This last is a prized medicament in the land on the other side of the\
  \ river, where scrapings from it are used as an aperient. Tossing his purchases\
  \ into a greaseproof paper bag, the grizzled old fool waits for nightfall before\
  \ plunging back into the river and returning to his own country. The police station\
  \ is shuttered and deserted, so he pauses to spit a gobbet of phlegm onto the door\
  \ before heading back towards the haberdashery under a gibbous moon.\nThe haberdasher's\
  \ excited children are all tucked up and fast asleep, but before gulping down their\
  \ bedtime milk slops they left some buttons and cloth and pins on a tray outside\
  \ the haberdasher's catflap. They also left a note in spidery handwriting for the\
  \ grizzled old fool, but they wrote it in Latin, so to him it is merely mumbo-jumbo.\
  \ Nevertheless, he puts the note in his greaseproof paper bag together with the\
  \ buttons and cloth and pins. Then he goes to the bus shelter to await what will\
  \ be a lovely magnificent dawn.\nThe colours for the dawn, in the pictorial version\
  \ of Grizzled Old Fool At The Haberdashery, were created by a pigmentist whose previous\
  \ contributions to the series include the garden of the mentalist, the daubs of\
  \ paint on the cuffs of a hobbledehoy, and the eerie twilight in Penge. I have a\
  \ great deal of respect for this pigmentist, more than I have for the grizzled old\
  \ fool himself, who has always seemed to me a rather one-dimensional character.\
  \ It is true that he is grizzled and old and foolish, which are three separate characteristics,\
  \ but quite honestly I think it is time he extended his repertoire. We have seen\
  \ him go the haberdashery and the chemist's shop and, in previous adventures, to\
  \ the clinic and the post office and the library and the community hub and the football\
  \ stadium and the pie shop and the orchestra pit and the marina and the gigantic\
  \ forbidding temple atop the craggy mountain and the slums and the duckpond and\
  \ the archipelago and the glue factory, but wherever he goes he remains simply grizzled\
  \ and old and foolish. Might I suggest that for his next appearance he grows a moustache\
  \ and sits, shattered, in a vaporetto, while the strains of the Adagietto from Mahler's\
  \ fifth symphony wash over us, and we burst into tears?\n[2008-05-14]"
