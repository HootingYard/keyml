  There are now more than 100 episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air available for your
  listening pleasure on Mixcloud. This means you could shove some headphones over
  your ears and listen to Mr Key babbling for two whole days without a break, and
  there would still be more to come. What bliss!

  Yesterday the umpteenth series began with this thrilling broadcast. Please note
  that the audio remains obstinately silent until about one minute in, due to technical
  gubbins beyond my puny understanding. Thereafter, you can listen to readings of
  When I Was Borp, Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchsrd, Pierre Et Clothilde, Pierre
  Et Les Pantoufles (featuring Plastic Bertrand) and The Pauper And The Princeling
  And The Pea.

  As ever, your monetary donations are more than welcome. Hit that Donate button over
  on the right, daddy-o!
