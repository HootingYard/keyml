text: "There is the story about the pauper who steals a pea from a princeling. Or\
  \ it may be that the princeling steals a pea from a pauper. I can never quite recall\
  \ which way round it goes. I ought to remember, because god knows I heard the story\
  \ often enough. My ma, or sometimes my pa, read it to me every single night, for\
  \ years and years, as my bedtime story. Perhaps that is why I don't remember it\
  \ with blinding clarity, because I was always falling asleep as I listened to it.\
  \ I fell asleep in spite of the undoubted excitement of the story, and of the Sturm\
  \ und Drang of the violent thunderstorms which were a constant feature of the weather\
  \ in that place at that time. I suspect my falling asleep came so easily because\
  \ my ma, or my pa, spiked my bedtime milk of magnesia with a powerful tranquiliser.\n\
  I was certainly a tranquil child. I never said \u201CBoo!\u201D to a goose. My parents\
  \ kept several geese, but I never dared say \u201CBoo!\u201D to a single one of\
  \ them. Frankly, they terrified me with their honking and their waddling about and\
  \ the whiteness of their feathers, a whiteness that seemed unearthly. It reminded\
  \ me of the final scene in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar\
  \ Allan Poe.\nOf course, I was not reminded of this when I was an unlettered tot,\
  \ it was only later, when I learned to read. At first I read childish comics like\
  \ The Ipsy Dipsy Doo and The Hammer of Christ, but I was a keen reader and swiftly\
  \ moved on to Enid Blyton and Enid Blytoff and Enid Blytattheendofthetunnel, before\
  \ tackling Burgess and Borges, and the gloomy Russians, and potboilers by Pebblehead,\
  \ until, at twelve, I read Arthur Gordon Pym, after which I was so unnerved by that\
  \ whiteness that I never read anything else, ever again, just reading Poe's novel\
  \ over and over again and again. It remains the only book on my bookshelf, which\
  \ rather obviates the need for the space provided by a shelf. Hence I have filled\
  \ it with plasticine models of a pauper and a pea and a princeling.\nI made these\
  \ models myself, visualising the pauper and the princeling based on what little\
  \ I could remember about my childhood bedtime story, and the pea on close observation\
  \ of a frozen pea I removed from a packet of frozen peas stored in the freezer compartment\
  \ of my refrigerator in my kitchen in my chalet high in the Alps near the sanatorium\
  \ where tubercular patients lie sprawled, exhausted, on balconies.\nAmong these\
  \ patients, who I watch through a pair of binoculars, is a fellow with a walrus\
  \ moustache who closely resembles the lumbering psychopathic serial killer Babinsky.\
  \ But it cannot be him. If it were, I like to think I would clamber up to his balcony\
  \ and engage him in conversation and ask him if he, too, grew up listening over\
  \ and over again and again to the tale of the pauper and the princeling and the\
  \ pea. If he had, and if he was indeed Babinsky, it would explain a lot about his\
  \ subsequent career raining violent havoc and mayhem upon the weedy and the blameless\
  \ and the innocent.\nWhen I tire of watching the Babinsky lookalike, I train my\
  \ binoculars upon the snow-capped Alpine peaks, white, so white, so unutterably,\
  \ blindingly white.\n[2017-08-06]"
