  \ Digest. This one is from her invaluable series \u201CThe Expectorations Of Various\
  \ Quadruped Beasts\u201D. Permission to reproduce it here was granted after I made\
  \ a donation to Miss Blossom Partridge's Lovely Bucolic Donkey Sanctuary. Though\
  \ small, the donation exacted was double the amount paid for permission to post\
  \ Miss Blossom Partridge's piece on giant albino kangaroos. I have decided to set\
  \ up a fund to meet what I fear may be ever-increasing costs demanded by the mysterious\
  \ Dr Grimes, who claims to be Miss Blossom Partridge's accountant. If you would\
  \ like to contribute, and so guarantee the opportunity to read more of her excellent\
  \ work, please whack that PayPal button over on the right of the screen and give\
  \ generously.\n\nLast week in Miss Blossom Partridge's Weekly Digest we considered\
  \ the sputum of giraffes, so this week, following the extremely complicated scheme\
  \ devised for this series, we turn inevitably to the spittle of donkeys. We looked\
  \ at giraffe sputum in a necessarily abstract, theoretical manner, but when it comes\
  \ to the spittle of donkeys we are going to take a more practical approach, so roll\
  \ up your sleeves, wash your hands with swarfega, and let's get down to business!\n\
  The first thing you need to do is to find some donkeys. Do not for one minute think\
  \ you can come a-trespassing in my Lovely Bucolic Donkey Sanctuary, however! It\
  \ is surrounded by an electrified fence and every hundred yards or so there is a\
  \ watchtower in which is perched one of my sentries armed with a high-velocity sniper's\
  \ rifle. Step over the whitewashed line parallel to the fence and you will be shot\
  \ in the centre of your forehead. I do not bandy about the word \u201Csanctuary\u201D\
  \ loosely.\nFar better that you go to the seaside, where donkeys are often to be\
  \ found giving rides along the beach to overexcited tinies. The seaside donkeymaster\
  \ may not take kindly to you collecting spittle from one of his donkeys, so what\
  \ you will need to do is to lure one away from the pack. Pick a donkey that is not,\
  \ at the time, laden with a squealing infant on its back. A small bale of straw\
  \ ought to be sufficient temptation for the donkey, but you will need to ensure\
  \ the donkeymaster's attention is distracted. This can be accomplished by, for example,\
  \ setting fire to an ice cream kiosk elsewhere on the beach. While the donkeymaster\
  \ is gazing, open-mouthed at the conflagration, wave the small bale of straw in\
  \ the face of your chosen donkey and lure it away until you are concealed by sand\
  \ dunes or some similar seaside beach feature.\nDo not fret your little head about\
  \ being charged with donkey abduction. Once you have collected its spittle, you\
  \ are going to return the donkey whence you found it, no harm done. Before so returning\
  \ it, you will again need to divert the donkeymaster's attention. For this purpose,\
  \ it can be useful to have an accomplice, a stooge who swims out to sea and then\
  \ pretends to be drowning, frantically waving their arms and shouting. But we are\
  \ leaping ahead of ourselves.\nDuly hidden behind dunes, or similar, you can begin\
  \ to feed handfuls of straw to the donkey. As it munches, spittle will be produced\
  \ from various glands in its mouth. I will not go into the precise physiological\
  \ details. Just bear with me. Now, while with one hand you tear off portions of\
  \ straw from the bale and stuff them into the donkey's mouth, with your other hand\
  \ you should be holding a bowl under its chin to collect such spittle as it dribbles\
  \ and drools. Remember that some donkeys slobber while eating more than others,\
  \ and do not hit any panic buttons. Provided the donkey munches straw for about\
  \ ten minutes, it should almost certainly produce sufficient spittle to fill your\
  \ bowl, if not to the brim then as near as dammit.\nWhen you are happy with the\
  \ amount of donkey spittle in your bowl, transfer it to a flask by means of a siphon\
  \ and funnel. Pat the donkey on its head to show your appreciation. Then use your\
  \ walkie-talkie to alert your accomplice, who should come scampering out of a chalet\
  \ in his swimming costume and hare across the beach and plunge into the sea and\
  \ swim out and then pretend to be drowning and wave and scream. Peering out from\
  \ behind the dunes, make sure the donkeymaster is distracted, and lead the donkey\
  \ back, inserting it among the other donkeys as if it had never been away. If an\
  \ infant is loitering nearby, pick it up and plop it on to the donkey's back. Thus,\
  \ when the donkeymaster turns around to scan his donkeys, he will be even less likely\
  \ to think one of them has been lured away behind the sand dunes to have its spittle\
  \ collected. You can now go home.\nIn your kitchenette, pour the donkey spittle\
  \ out of the flask into a container. There will almost certainly be a few strands\
  \ of munched straw intermingled with the spittle, so pick them out with a pair of\
  \ tweezers and discard them in your bin. Do the same with any other foreign bodies\
  \ that have found their way into the container until you have one hundred percent\
  \ pure donkey spittle. This can then be used for a vast range of different purposes,\
  \ most of which hark back centuries and have come down to us through rustic lore\
  \ and wisdom.\nWhile you ponder to precisely what purpose you intend to put the\
  \ spittle of the donkey, take a moment to thank your lucky stars that you live in\
  \ an enlightened age. Had you been found poring over a container of donkey spittle\
  \ at virtually any time in those past centuries, you would have been burned as a\
  \ witch.\n[2012-09-27]"
