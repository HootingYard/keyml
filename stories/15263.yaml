text: "Chief among the Loopy Prigs of Shelmerdox was one whose head had dimensions\
  \ similar to those of a large plum, and its hue too, its hue or tint if you will,\
  \ a splenetic fellow of milk-stained necktie and eggy brow, whatever that might\
  \ be, slumped in his hammock at all hours save for when he was off on a jaunt armed\
  \ with a blunderbuss and the head of wrung-necked chicken dangling from a lanyard\
  \ about which, foolishly, he had written a song, Oh Lanyard Fair!, to the tune of\
  \ Carry On Wayward Son by Kansas, nothing to do, apparently, with the Carry On film\
  \ series starring such screen luminaries as Hattie Jacques and Charles Hawtrey,\
  \ the latter a resident of Deal, near Sandwich, in Kent, where the Chief Loopy Prig\
  \ of Shelmerdox had been known to picnic, on occasion, and exhibit his gift for\
  \ snatching wasps in mid-buzz, reaching to grab them in his fist, with its strange\
  \ musculature, before plopping them into an empty marmalade jar and screwing the\
  \ lid down tight, the better to transport them to the Wasp Zoo at Tantarabim Bamforth,\
  \ a place with the only known conjunction of bim and bam in its name if the gazetteers\
  \ of that land were to be believed, and why would they not be?\nI put this question,\
  \ in its entirety, from that opening \u201CChief\u201D to the closing \u201Cbe\u201D\
  , to both Condoleezza Rice and Ringo Starr. Neither has seen fit to reply, yet,\
  \ which causes me some grief, though not enough grief to provoke weeping, yet. The\
  \ weeping will come, I am sure of it, perhaps by next Thursday, if I have still\
  \ not heard from Rice or Starr, in which case I will be minded to take the Alger\
  \ Hiss Option. It is unclear to me of what this option consists, but I will strive\
  \ to find out by visiting my local librar, abutting the market square, with its\
  \ enormous cement horse trough now a bed of flowers, pinks and posies and lupins\
  \ and hollyhocks, and nary a horse in sight, any more, since the triumph of the\
  \ motor car.\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. For example,\
  \ only the other day I met, in a shabby cafeteria, a dreamer, who once played the\
  \ drums for Freddie's pop group, and he told me that he had been dreaming about\
  \ the Chief Loopy Prig of Shelmerdox, except that for him it was more nightmare\
  \ than dream, for the wasp had escaped from the marmalade jar\u2014how?\u2014and\
  \ stung him on his eggy brow\u2014that mysterious phrase again!\u2014thus waking\
  \ him from his troubled sleep, waking him into a world where there was no sting,\
  \ no wasp, nor even a Loopy Prig of Shelmerdox. Thus baffled, the dreamy drummer\
  \ arose from his bed, and threw away his crutches, and walked!\nTo where did he\
  \ walk?\nTo Tantarabim Bamforth.\nAnd what did he do there?\nHe rattled a tin.\n\
  What was in the tin?\nTwo buttons.\nFrom whence had the buttons come?\nThe buttons\
  \ had once been the eyes of a rag doll, a ventriloquist's dummy, now blind, languishing\
  \ in a crate in a storage facility in Deal, near Sandwich, in Kent. Imagine that.\n\
