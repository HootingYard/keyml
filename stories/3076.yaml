text: "Legal Notice\_: The Sludge Hall Farm in this piece ought not be confused with\
  \ the Sludge Hall Farm mentioned on Wednesday. They are two distinctly different\
  \ farms, and halls. The sludge itself is, in most respects, broadly similar.\nIt\
  \ is a meteorological peculiarity that the sky over Sludge Hall Farm is always leaden,\
  \ the air thick and oppressive, as if a storm is imminent, but a storm never comes.\
  \ Equally anomalous is the fact that, over at Sludge Hall itself, the storminess\
  \ never ceases, the semidilapidated building forever assailed by thunder and wrack\
  \ and downpour.\nOne does not often meet with a trio of stylishly dressed Italian\
  \ police investigators tramping up the path to Sludge Hall Farm. In their Giuseppe\
  \ Fonseca suits and Boffo Splendido shoes, they cut the sort of dash not seen in\
  \ this landscape for a century, since the heyday of the so-called \u201Cpeasantry\
  \ moderne\u201D movement. They have come from Sludge Hall, where they were received\
  \ in the cubby by the monopod major domo, who served them with cream crackers and\
  \ iron tonic. Thus fortified, the detectives announced their intention to visit\
  \ the farm. The major domo shuddered, but swiftly dissembled, creaking on his crutch\
  \ over to the dresser upon which rested Sludge Hall's only metal tapping machine,\
  \ a vintage wonder.\n\u201CI shall let the farmer know to expect you,\u201D said\
  \ the major domo. The detectives preened their mustachios and glanced at each other,\
  \ and then at their host, and then out of the smudged cubby window, its frame rattling\
  \ as the tempest roared outside.\nHaving tapped out his communiqu\xE9, the major\
  \ domo made arrangements for Lars, the factotum, to take the Italians on his covered\
  \ cart half way towards the farm, to the point where the storm weirdly ceased and\
  \ the leaden pall sapped all vigour from the air. And it is some yards beyond where\
  \ Lars dropped them off that we find the detectives now, each walking with insouciance\
  \ and swish. If Sludge Hall Farm harboured a comely milkmaid, no doubt she would\
  \ swoon at the sight of such unimpeachable foreign elegance. Alas, it is many a\
  \ long year since comeliness in any form has blessed the farm. As the policemen\
  \ are about to learn, it is now a grim and godawful place.\nNo one knows the name\
  \ of the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm. He is a hermit and a mystic and a polevaulting\
  \ champion. Though aged and wizened, and though his many, many medals are now rusted\
  \ and the velvet cushions upon which they sat are eaten away by worms, the farmer\
  \ still polevaults every day, morning and evening, under the leaden sky at Sludge\
  \ Hall Farm. He is puffing from a polevault as the Italian detectives push open\
  \ the gate and greet him.\nOne wonders what will happen. Will the farmer of Sludge\
  \ Hall Farm speak for the first time in twenty years? Will he use his mystic powers\
  \ to crack asunder the close-knit and almost telepathic team spirit of the detective\
  \ trio, until they are snarling at each other like mad dogs and fighting with pitchforks?\
  \ Will one of the detectives seek refuge in a barn, only to be set upon by a hideous\
  \ mutant angry pig that has snapped its chain? Will the pig, its thirst for Italian\
  \ blood unquenched, then rampage around the farmyard causing the surviving pair\
  \ of policemen to hide in a hayloft? Will the farmer placate his mutant pig and\
  \ place it in a trance? Why is the hay in the hayloft not like normal hay? Is it\
  \ hay from another dimension, or from somewhere else in the space-time continuum?\
  \ How has the farmer managed to fill the Sludge Hall Farm hayloft with inexplicably\
  \ bizarre hay? Why have the mustachios of the Italian detectives shrivelled by dint\
  \ of their huddling in the hay? What in the name of heaven is the mystic farmer\
  \ doing, leading his entranced pig in ever more rapid circles around a bonfire?\
  \ What is the exact nature of those sparks shooting from the fire? Why is the leaden\
  \ sky turning a violent orange? Why are the detectives now sprouting hay from every\
  \ pore? Is there any intelligible meaning to the deafening grunts the entranced\
  \ mutant pig is making as it circles around the fire faster and faster until it\
  \ is a blur? Why, back at Sludge Hall, are the major domo and Lars hyperventilating,\
  \ convulsed by giggles, slapping their thighs and dancing a jig upon the dining\
  \ room table?\nTomorrow, when we read the front page headline in the Daily Farmyard\
  \ Polevaulter, will we be any the wiser about that awful mess at Sludge Hall Farm?\n\
