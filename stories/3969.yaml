text: "Some years ago, I wrote about Dobson's foolish theory that the person from\
  \ Porlock who fatally interrupted the composition of Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor\
  \ Coleridge was, in fact, some kind of pod person from a parallel Porlock beyond\
  \ the stars. I noted at the time that Dobson had never seen fit to devote a pamphlet\
  \ to this twaddle, leaving us in some doubt as to the nature of this pod person,\
  \ and in utter ignorance about the Porlock from whence it came.\nMost people who\
  \ have studied the matter conclude that the person in Dobson's theory was a flesh-eating\
  \ space zombie hatched from a pod, the pod itself brought to the vicinity of the\
  \ Exmoor cottage in which Coleridge was staying by a primitive interplanetary cargo\
  \ ship, intentionally or otherwise. But if this were so, and one such pod person\
  \ came bashing upon the cottage door, how did the poet survive such an encounter?\
  \ Survive it he did, of course, going on to live a long(ish) and fantastically talkative\
  \ life thereafter.\nOther questions surround the matter of Porlock, whether\u2014\
  in the theory\u2014the pod-packed cargo ship crash-landed in the Somerset village\
  \ of that name, or whether there is, somewhere in the mighty universe, a planet\
  \ Porlock where are bred pod persons.\nThe latest writer to turn his attention to\
  \ this fascinating business is Pebblehead, whose brand new bestselling paperback\
  \ is entitled Person From Porlock! Note the missing Pod prefix. Pebblehead's book\
  \ is a first-person narrative, as if recounted by the \u201Cperson on business from\
  \ Porlock\u201D himself, beginning a week before he strides o'er the loam to the\
  \ cottage where Coleridge is ensconced, and ending, years and years later, as he\
  \ faces death in a Victorian Porlock workhouse, his business, and his wits, having\
  \ failed. In a tremendously exciting passage, Pebblehead has the raving and babbling\
  \ person from Porlock imagining, on his deathbed, an encounter with his pod-doppelg\xE4\
  nger who, it transpires, has been skulking about in his wake, like the familiar\
  \ in the story by J Sheridan Le Fanu, ever since the fateful day in 1797 when he\
  \ rapped upon Coleridge's cottage door.\nSeveral readers have pointed out the efforts\
  \ Pebblehead takes to emphasise that this part of his narrative is, in his own words,\
  \ \u201Cthe hysterical drivel of a brainsick maniac\u201D, and taken this to be\
  \ a barb aimed at Dobson. Could it be that the paperbackist is limbering up for\
  \ his long-rumoured unauthorised biography of the out of print pamphleteer, a work\
  \ in progress which, it is said, will topple Dobson from his plinth in the pantheon\
  \ of pamphleteers? No word comes from Pebblehead's \u201Cchalet o\u2019 prose\u201D\
  , only the sound of the indefatigable hammering of his fat fingers upon his battered\
  \ and bloody keyboard.\nPerson From Porlock! by Pebblehead is published by Hefty\
  \ Airport Bookstall Paperbacks Ltd, and is available from all good airport bookstalls.\n\
