text: "I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I think I have the\
  \ makings of an excellent singing teacher. I am to pedagogy as a duck to water.\
  \ There is nothing that cannot be taught by ferocious spittle-flecked shouting accompanied\
  \ by thumps on the head with a big stick. It is true that my field of expertise\
  \ is ornithology, not singing, but I have taught even the most recalcitrant dimwit\
  \ to identify four different types of bird, with as near as dammit a twenty-five\
  \ percent success rate. The birds were a swan, an owl, a wren, and an ostrich.\n\
  I'd like to teach the world to sing, and the world is rather larger than the classroom\
  \ in the cellar of Pang Hill Orphanage, where I currently teach. In fact I have\
  \ never taught anywhere else, as far as I can recall. And I have rarely taught anything\
  \ other than bird identification skills, apart from occasional sessions of boot-scrubbing,\
  \ mucking about with saucepans, and guttural German. But pedagogy courses through\
  \ my veins like blood. The more recalcitrant dimwits among the orphans often develop\
  \ nosebleeds after my thumpings, so I know what blood looks like, even though it\
  \ is not my field of expertise.\nAnother reason I am well suited to the task of\
  \ teaching the world to sing is that I awake every morning with a song in my heart.\
  \ Often it is a tuneless and monotonous dirge, which is the best I can muster when\
  \ I wake in a foul temper, as I usually do. My attic bedroom at Pang Hill Orphanage\
  \ is dark and dismal and icy cold, even at the height of summer. I have been told\
  \ this is something to do with local atmospheric conditions, but such conditions\
  \ are outwith my field of expertise, so I cannot judge the truth of the claim. Sometimes\
  \ a frail and freezing robin will come and perch on my windowsill of a morning.\
  \ I think it is a robin, though it is difficult to tell through the grease- and\
  \ grime-smeared window. But at the sight, albeit blurred, of a feathered friend,\
  \ the song in my heart is a cheerier and more up-tempo one, such as \u201CWithered\
  \ And Died\u201D by Richard and Linda Thompson.\nBefore I teach the world to sing,\
  \ then, I will make a start by teaching the orphans to sing. But before I teach\
  \ the orphans to sing, I will hone my singing-teacher techniques\u2014shouting,\
  \ big stick\u2014by teaching monkeys to sing. There is a Monkey House at Pang Hill\
  \ Zoo, over on the other side of the hill beyond the viaduct. Through bribery and\
  \ threats I obtained a key to the Monkey House. I think the janitor who passed me\
  \ the key assumed I wanted to gain access to the monkeys for unseemly purposes.\
  \ Well, let him think what he likes. I will betray him to the zoo authorities in\
  \ any case, and he will languish in a prison cell while I teach the monkeys to sing.\n\
  UPDATE\_: I have discovered that most of the monkeys in the Monkey House at Pang\
  \ Hill Zoo are howler monkeys. They can already howl their little heads off like\
  \ nobody's business. My work is done.\n[2016-01-31]"
