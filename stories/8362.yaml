text: "Pontiuses is the name given to the healthful and invigorating physical exercise\
  \ system devised by Joseph Pontius in the early twentieth century in Germany. It\
  \ is broadly similar to the rival system known as Pilates. Well, actually, it is\
  \ completely dissimilar, but I am all of a dither what with one thing and another.\
  \ Only a person in the throes of a dither could possibly confuse their Pontiuses\
  \ with their Pilates, for they have nothing whatsoever in common save for being\
  \ physical exercise systems developed in the early twentieth century in Germany\
  \ by men called Joseph whose surnames began with the letter P. I will try to stabilise\
  \ my dither so I can continue this essay in prose of glistening clarity.\nIf you\
  \ were to stumble upon a grouplet of Pontiuses-practising persons in a field, or\
  \ in a municipal leisure facility, the first thing that would strike you would be\
  \ their \u201Cgear\u201D. Not for the Pontiusesist the leotards favoured by Pilatesists.\
  \ No indeed. Here is a first-hand description of the outfit commonly worn when getting\
  \ into the Pontiuses groove:\nI had my feather in my cap as big as a flag in the\
  \ fore-top; my French dublet gelte in the bellie as though (like a pig readie to\
  \ be spitted) all my guts had bin pluckt out; a paire of side paned hose that hung\
  \ downe like two scales filled with Holland cheeses; my longe stock that sate close\
  \ to my docke, and smoothered not a scab or a leacherous hairie sinew on the calfe\
  \ of the legge; my rapier pendant like a round sticke fastned in the tacklings for\
  \ skippers the better to climbe by; my cape cloake of blacke cloth, overspreading\
  \ my backe like a thorne-backe, or an Elephantes eare, that hanges on his shoulders\
  \ like a countrie huswives banskin which she thirles hir spindle on; & in consummation\
  \ of my curiositie, my hands without glooves, all a more French, and a blacke budge\
  \ edging of a beard on the upper lip, & the like sable auglet of excrements in the\
  \ rising of the anckle of my chin.\nReaders of a Tudor bent may recognise that dandyish\
  \ apparel as being broadly similar to the costume worn by young Jack Wilton, the\
  \ narrator of Thomas Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller (1594). What am I saying,\
  \ \u201Cbroadly similar\u201D? It is identical. Clearly I have yet to subjugate\
  \ my dither. I must marshal my forces. Perhaps I ought to go and do some Pontiuses\
  \ myself.\nNow you might think it would be difficult, or at least inconvenient,\
  \ to perform invigorating exercises when dressed up to the nines like a foppish\
  \ Elizabethan roister doister. As indeed it is. But therein lies the key to the\
  \ magnificent efficacy of Pontiuses. Or at least, one of the keys. Apparently, there\
  \ are several, if we are to credit the title of the \u201Cguidance\u201D published\
  \ by Joseph Pontius, The Several Keys To The Magnificent Efficacy Of The Pontiuses\
  \ Physical Exercise System Devised By Myself On A Thursday Afternoon In D\xFCsseldorf\
  \ During A Downpour (1929). I give it in English, though the book, all nine hundred\
  \ pages of it, was written in Solresol, the artificial language devised by Fran\xE7\
  ois Sudre and expounded in Boleslas Gajewski's Grammaire du Solresol (1902), a signed\
  \ copy of which Pontius had committed to memory. Not being able to speak or read\
  \ Solresol myself, I have no idea what Pontius has to say in his \u201Cguidance\u201D\
  , but I am not going to let that stop me. I am manfully overcoming my dither and\
  \ shall press on.\nI said that the first thing that would strike you were you to\
  \ come upon a grouplet of Pontiusesists would be their clothing. Hard upon the heels\
  \ of that sensation would come a second, as you were made dizzy by the sight of\
  \ what at first glance would look like people engaged in haphazard jumping about\
  \ while having spasmodic fits. You might even cast your eyes about to spot a rabid\
  \ dog, foaming at the mouth, assuming all the people had been bitten by it. But\
  \ gradually you would begin to discern a pattern, indeed a profound order, in what\
  \ seemed to be mere frantic cavorting. If it turned out there was a rabid dog in\
  \ the vicinity, that would be mere coincidence, though you would be advised to report\
  \ its presence to a public health official on doggy duty in his booth or kiosk,\
  \ if you could find it. Sometimes these officials hide themselves away so they can\
  \ spend their days uninterrupted by hound-troubled citizens. It is quite scandalous.\n\
  Scandal was something that dogged Joseph Pontius too. But then, the Weimar Republic\
  \ was riddled with scandal, from top to bottom, so when the inventor of Pontiuses\
  \ was arrested and charged and convicted and imprisoned in a case of unseemliness,\
  \ it barely made the headlines. He did not waste his time in gaol, however, adapting\
  \ his physical exercise system for the confined space of a cell. Rather than seemingly\
  \ haphazard jumping about, the incarcerated Pontiusesist throws himself repeatedly\
  \ at the walls in a strictly regulated sequence of spasmodic lurching movements.\
  \ Reluctantly, Pontius had to discard the preening Tudor gallant's apparel and approve\
  \ the practice of Pontiuses while wearing the harsh grey sackcloth of Weimar prison\
  \ uniform.\nWhat this means is that there is a deal of difference between Pontiuses\
  \ In Prison and plain old Pontiuses. Even I can tell them apart, even when my senses\
  \ are muffled by dither. Which, I am pleased to say, they are not, any more, today,\
  \ for I have smashed the dither to bits, simply through willpower, and I did not\
  \ even need to perform any Pontiuses to get me this far, which makes me wonder if\
  \ the exercises are actually worth doing. Probably not, I would aver. I think I\
  \ shall put my feet up and have a cup of tea instead.\n[2012-02-13]"
