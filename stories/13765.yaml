text: 'From the porthole of your bathyscaphe, you see a pair of crabs scuttling across
  the floor of a silent sea. They are discussing the poetry of T S Eliot. It may be
  thought that critical analysis of modernist verse requires higher cognitive functions
  than those possessed by crabs, whose brains are tiny. Indeed, they are about the
  size of the tip of a ballpoint pen. But you might be surprised. The difficulty,
  for you, is one of translation. Crabs have fairly rudimentary communication skills,
  but they do communicate with each other, and sometimes the subject of those communications
  might be The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock. But you would not know this, behind
  the reinforced glass of your bathyscaphe porthole. You would just see a pair of
  scuttling crabs and have no idea what was going on in their strange little heads.
  What you would need is some sort of manual, clearly-written, to enable you to decipher
  the signals being passed from crab to crab. At time of writing, no such manual exists.

  But there you are, at the bottom of the silent sea, with a perfect view. Perhaps
  fate has decreed that you are the person to write that manual, to learn to communicate
  with crabs in their own language! It will probably take months, if not years, of
  study, and of course you do not have that much time, because before long your oxygen
  supply will be exhausted and you will have to return to the surface of the silent
  sea and return the bathyscaphe to the chandler from whom you hired it. So before
  surfacing, it will be a good idea to point your camera at the pair of crabs and
  film their discussion of T S Eliot for several minutes. You will then be able to
  study the film, oh so brow-furrowingly, in the comfort of your permanently-oxygenated
  seaside redoubt.

  We shall all look forward to the publisher''s announcement of A Clearly-Written
  Manual Of Rudimentary Crab Communication, including several chapters of crab-exegesis
  of the poetry of T S Eliot, translated into human.
