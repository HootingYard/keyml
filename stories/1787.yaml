text: "I have been much enjoying the Times Archive Blog recently. Old news can be\
  \ so much more appealing than new news\u2014that is, news\u2014particularly when,\
  \ as in this case which I belatedly bring to your attention, it features a postie\
  \ toppling into a ditch, a scene that could come straight from a Hooting Yard story:\n\
  About noon on Thursday as a labourer, in the employ of Mr Cooper, of Pyrford\u2014\
  a village about seven miles from Guildford\u2014was passing through Pondfield, in\
  \ the neighbourhood of his master's farm, he espied an object in the ditch, which\
  \ attracted his attention. On examination the object, which was nearly covered with\
  \ snow, turned out to be a man named Tappin, the messenger who delivers post letters\
  \ in the outlying districts of which Pyrford and Wisley form part. Mr Cooper was\
  \ at once communicated with, and he speedily arranged for the delivery of the letters,\
  \ while with equal promptitude the messenger was assisted from his bed of snow,\
  \ where he had been for some hours. Tappin's account is that he got into the drift\
  \ and pitched headlong into the ditch, when he was too exhausted to extricate himself.\n\
  As the Times\u2019 archivist notes, how pleasing it is that the reporter assures\
  \ us of the safe delivery of the post before\_mentioning the rescue of the hapless\
  \ Tappin. I suspect strongly that, almost a century and a half after his ditch trauma,\
  \ Postie Tappin may be resurrected as a Hooting Yard character.\n[2009-02-13]"
