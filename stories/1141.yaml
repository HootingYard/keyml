  \ waiting to be written on names\u2014how the Amalgamated Union of Wire-Drawers,\
  \ Fettlers and Allied Trades turns in thirty years into something called \u2018\
  Together\u2019 or \u2018Unity\u2019, British Insulated Cable and Radio Limited into\
  \ \u2018Xantippe\u2019 or \u2018Xenith\u2019, and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment\
  \ via \u2018Defence Research Agency\u2019 into \u2018QinetiQ\u2019. The key being\
  \ that the old, wordy, literate names actually described what the organisation did,\
  \ the new ones conceal it and are post-literate, logos in letter form.\u201D\nAnd\
  \ let us not forget the harebrained attempt by the Royal Mail to \u201Crebrand\u201D\
  \ itself as Consignia.\n[2008-12-21]"
