text: "Readers may recall my essay about the world-famous food-splattered Jesuit.\
  \ I imagined a music hall act of \u201Csheer simplicity. The curtains would open\
  \ and there, on stage, world-famous and splattered with food, stood a Jesuit. He\
  \ would extend his arms, almost in crucifixion pose, and gaze at a point slightly\
  \ above the heads of the audience. There were no frills, no \u2018business\u2019\
  \ with props. After a few minutes, the curtains would close, and\u2014barring the\
  \ inevitable encore\u2014that was that.\u201D\nIt has now come to my attention that,\
  \ as so often, the real world anticipated the supposedly wacky world of Hooting\
  \ Yard, and by many decades. Via Strange Flowers, I learned today of Weimar cabaret\
  \ artist Valeska Gert. \u201CIn the 1920s, Gert premiered one of her most provocative\
  \ works entitled Pause. Performed in between reels at Berlin cinemas, it was intended\
  \ to draw attention to inactivity, silence, serenity, and stillness amidst all the\
  \ movement and chaos in modern life. She came onstage and literally just stood there.\
  \ \u2018It was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema and stand there and\
  \ do nothing,\u2019 said Wolfgang Mueller.\u201D\nHere she is in more animated mode:\n\
