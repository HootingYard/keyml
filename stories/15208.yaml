text: "Lost trinket in ditch. Sky the colour of blubber. Elves darting from elm to\
  \ elm. Time for pancakes. First, obtain a pan. Not the Great God Pan. He has other\
  \ fish to fry. There are no fish in the ditch. It is a dry ditch, not a drainage\
  \ ditch. Ah, drainage! The Great God Pan is wearing drainpipe trousers. It is his\
  \ new look. He is standing next to a real drainpipe. The blubbery sky threatens\
  \ rain. It will send water pouring down the drainpipe. Across the road, a clairvoyant\
  \ is driving pigs to market.\nThe trinket is a pig-shaped trinket. It belonged to\
  \ one of the elves. The selves of elves are unreadable. They keep their distance.\
  \ They laugh in the face of death. They keep their chins up. One elf has warts on\
  \ his shins. They require ointment. That's right, oint.\nYou can oint elvish shins\
  \ with all manner of goo. Come get your goo, elf! It will cost a pretty penny. Or\
  \ in exchange for a trinket. Maps and atlases chocker with elms. Elves unseen, because\
  \ unreported by mappers. Soup and bridles. Bridles and soup. Odd sound of egg on\
  \ wafer. The Great God Pan is riding pillion.\nEgg? Wafer? Morse code for both.\
  \ What hath the Great God Pan wrought? Better drainage under blubber. It is no mean\
  \ feat. Cox in boat with hacking cough. Given a lozenge. Given shrikes. Blue boat\
  \ on Blubber Island Lake. Towelled down on Thursdays. To the sound of Petula Clark.\
  \ Elves\u2019 eggs. Oh such yolks as unseen for centuries past!\nDim, dim, dim.\
  \ Boisterous blips. Devil take the blue tail fly. These are the words of Piffleboy.\n\
