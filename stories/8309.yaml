text: "22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with\
  \ the princes of Moab.\n22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the\
  \ angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding\
  \ upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.\n22:23 And the ass saw the angel\
  \ of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass\
  \ turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass,\
  \ to turn her into the way.\n22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of\
  \ the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\n22:25 And\
  \ when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and\
  \ crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.\n22:26 And the\
  \ angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way\
  \ to turn either to the right hand or to the left.\n22:27 And when the ass saw the\
  \ angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled,\
  \ and he smote the ass with a staff.\n22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the\
  \ ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten\
  \ me these three times?\n22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked\
  \ me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.\n22:30\
  \ And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden\
  \ ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And\
  \ he said, Nay.\n22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel\
  \ of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed\
  \ down his head, and fell flat on his face.\n22:32 And the angel of the LORD said\
  \ unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went\
  \ out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:\n22:33 And the ass\
  \ saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely\
  \ now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.\n22:34 And Balaam said unto the\
  \ angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way\
  \ against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.\n22:35\
  \ And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word\
  \ that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes\
  \ of Balak.\nThere is more to the story of Balaam, but it need not detain us here.\
  \ The crucial point is that we have no evidence the LORD, having opened the mouth\
  \ of the ass\u2014that is, given the gift of human speech to Balaam's donkey\u2014\
  remembers to close the mouth of the ass, or take away the gift of speech, before\
  \ Balaam and the donkey trot away with the princes of Balak. We must therefore assume\
  \ that it continues to speak.\nThat, at least was the conclusion of the dipsomaniacal\
  \ Irish playwright Finbarr na [Unpronounceable Thicket of Consonants], who in 1959\
  \ produced his most famous work, The Donkey Dialogues. When the play begins, Balaam\
  \ and his ass have taken leave of the princes of Balak and gone a-wandering throughout\
  \ the Middle East and beyond, ending up\u2014surprise surprise!\u2014in Dublin.\
  \ They roam from bar to bar, drinking pints of porter, and regaling their fellow-drinkers\
  \ with what are supposed to be comic skits. Much of the so-called humour relies\
  \ on the idea that Balaam is a foolish glutton while the donkey is imbued by the\
  \ LORD not only with a human speaking voice but with His Ineffable Being. The donkey\
  \ is, in other words, in this reading, God.\nUnsurprisingly, the playwright was\
  \ accused of blasphemy and more than one priest personally socked him on the jaw.\n\
  Of more interest perhaps is what has been done with Finbarr's work in a new adaptation\
  \ for television. Balaam and his ass are no longer relocated to Dublin, they barely\
  \ drink at all, and the comedy dialogues are jettisoned entirely. Speaking in generic\
  \ BBC peasant accents (\xE0 la Lark Rise To Candleford) the pair traipse back and\
  \ forth across the sun-bashed verdant fields between Lark Rise and Candleford, exchanging\
  \ observations about the peasantry, the weather, and ancient hostilities between\
  \ the Israelites and the Moabites and the Amorites. Thankfully, there is no attempt\
  \ at humour.\nWhereas in the original, it was difficult for an audience to suspend\
  \ disbelief at the absurd picture of a talking donkey in an Irish bar, it seems\
  \ perfectly plausible, in the rustic setting, to have a man and a donkey trudging\
  \ across the fields chatting to one another. Plausibility alone does not make for\
  \ good drama, however, and there have been mutterings in the production suite. In\
  \ the planned second series, Balaam's ass will be stricken with a mysterious and\
  \ seemingly incurable donkey disease, allowing for the introduction of a new character,\
  \ a maverick young veterinary surgeon newly arrived in the countryside muck from\
  \ the urban metropolis.\nThere is also talk of giving the talking donkey its own\
  \ Saturday night television chat show, in which it will interrogate movers and shakers\
  \ (Rolf Harris, Benedict Cumberbatch, Yoko Ono) on their knowledge of peasants and\
  \ weather and Israelites and Moabites and Amorites and smiting with sticks.\n[2012-02-05]"
