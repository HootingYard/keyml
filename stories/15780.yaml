text: "\nSince this blog began in 2003, I have posted pretty much all the stories\
  \ which were originally published as Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets (out of\
  \ print) in the last century. The glaring exception is Obsequies For Lars Talc,\
  \ Struck By Lightning. A short extract has appeared, but the full text is unavailable\
  \ to all but the lucky (and sensible) few who bought the pamphlet back in 1994.\
  \ It was the longest tale I issued as a spineless short-run pamphlet, and also the\
  \ last. Shortly after it appeared, I descended into the Wilderness Years.\nIn a\
  \ few days\u2019 time I shall be heading off to foreign parts again. Rather than\
  \ leave you lot enmired in the unspeakable misery of No-Hooting-Yard-Updates-Land,\
  \ it occurred to me to take advantage of the WordPress feature whereby I can prepare\
  \ posts and set a future date and time for automated publication. Thus I have been\
  \ busy tippy-tapping the text of Obsequies \u2026 and it will appear, one chapter\
  \ per day, over the next fifteen days, starting tomorrow.\nAs ever when revisiting\
  \ my stuff from long ago, I have been tempted to revise and tweak and edit, to rid\
  \ the prose of infelicities and howlers and horrors. But I decided to leave this\
  \ intact, almost exactly as it was when published twenty-three years ago. It might\
  \ cause me\u2014and indeed you lot\u2014to groan from time to time, but, hey, I\
  \ was younger then, and more stupid, and a hopeless drunk.\nShould any typos have\
  \ crept in undetected, I am sure an eagle-eyed reader (you know who you are) will\
  \ alert me to them. I will correct them when I'm back in Blighty.\nFinally, remember\
  \ that you used to have to pay for this stuff, and a copy of the original pamphlet\
  \ would fetch a hefty price on eBay. So please consider whacking the \u201CMake\
  \ A Donation\u201D button over to your right, and shovelling some loose change in\
  \ my direction. It could help pay for a wreath for the grave of poor Lars Talc,\
  \ struck by lightning \u2026.\n\u2026 Chapter One of which will appear tomorrow.\n\
