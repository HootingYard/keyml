text: "And lo! there came unto Gath an man whose head was as the head of the otter.\n\
  And his body also was as the form of the otter and likewise his dimension.\nAnd\
  \ when the man spoke his voice was as the cry of the otter.\nNow the people of Gath,\
  \ seeing this, were much afraid.\nThey gathered about the man with their pointy\
  \ sticks and led him unto their Hierophant.\nNow the Hierophant of Gath dwelt in\
  \ a place of much mist and vapourousness unyielding.\nAnd the people said \u201C\
  O Hierophant of Gath, we bring you this man in form like unto the otter, what shall\
  \ we do with him?\u201D\nAnd with his mouth the Hierophant of Gath spoke mumbo-jumbo\
  \ unto them and they laid down their pointy sticks and returned to their fathers\u2019\
  \ fields where many tares were sown.\nAnd he took the man like unto the otter into\
  \ his house in the mists.\nAnd the next day there came tidings of the Hindenburg\
  \ disaster.\n[2018-02-25]"
