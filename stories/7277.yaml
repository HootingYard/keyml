text: "Among Sam's other attributes was the gift of divination. He was the primitive\
  \ man, a part of nature's self, and he looked upon the truth unblinded, undimmed\
  \ by the veil of knowledge formalized. In this respect he was absolutely uncanny,\
  \ a person to be discussed and analyzed in remote rooms or upon quiet walks. Sam\
  \ never talked about these supernatural powers, and so far as I know the Society\
  \ for Psychical Research never had him under inspection, but he had these powers,\
  \ abnormally, unhumanly developed, not only had them, but used them, nightly\u2026\
  \ Sam had but to cast one searching, secret-revealing glance at the luminaries of\
  \ the college heaven, and there was nothing that would fain be hid that was not\
  \ revealed, revealed not merely in broad outline, but in tiniest detail, threatening\
  \ disorders forecast to the very quarter of an hour.\nfrom Samuel Osborne, Janitor\
  \ by Frederick Morgan Padelford (c. 1913)\n[2011-09-13]"
