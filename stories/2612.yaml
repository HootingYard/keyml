text: "If Charles Montagu Doughty (1843\u20131926) is remembered today at all, it\
  \ is as the author of Travels In Arabia Deserta, a classic account of his wanderings\
  \ in northern Arabia, published in 1888. One hesitates to call it influential, for\
  \ it is written in a highly-wrought, archaic, often quite bonkers style that is\
  \ probably inimitable. But it has, at least, been more or less constantly in print\
  \ since T E Lawrence enthused about it in the 1920s\u2014unlike Doughty's later\
  \ works, mad epics written in verse so chunky and chewy and Anglo Saxon they make\
  \ virtually anything else read like pointyhead management-guff.\nThe titles include\
  \ The Dawn In Britain (Volume One of which has been recently reissued, I discover\
  \ with glee), Adam Cast Forth, The Titans, and Mansoul, Or The Riddle Of The World.\
  \ For your edification and enlightenment, Mr Key has picked some of his favourite\
  \ lines and phrases from Book One of the last-named. [Sic] throughout, by the way,\
  \ all checked and re-checked.\nSun-stricken inhuman wasteful ground\nI heard, hoarse\
  \ murmuring tumult as of sea / Deeps long-maned wave-rows, beating boisterous; /\
  \ And rushing billows, like to raging scour / Of ravening wolves; wide whelming\
  \ on sea-cliffs. / And creaking-winged mews\u2019 clamour, cleping loud,/ O'er long\
  \ fore-shore\nOf human souls such multitude He comprised; / As clustered blebs,\
  \ some greater and some less; / We see oft in wind-driven floc of foam, / In day\
  \ of storm, on some tempestuous strand.\nI slumbered till a turtles\u2019 gentle\
  \ flock, / \u2026 folding from flight / Their rattling wings; lighted on vermeil\
  \ feet; / Jetting, with mincing pace, their iris necks; / With crooling throat-bole;\
  \ voice of peace and rest\nGurgles from hid grot\nBroods o'er these thymy eyots\
  \ drowsy hum\nThey sound their shrill small clarions / And hurl by booming dors,\
  \ gross bee-fly kin\nDawns shrill medleyed babble of early birds ; / And Summers\
  \ breath, in the bleak poplar leaves.\nWhence fuming incense doth embalm his brain\n\
  Hewed as we sea-shells see within appear. / Whereon were laced, with curious device\
  \ / Of antique art, in purple leathern work ; / Buskins, whose shining knops were\
  \ Albans gold.\nThese unhewn sunless labyrinthine crypts\nThe temple-maiden had\
  \ aforetime scruzed, / Nepenthe and clary and moly\nA croc of nard, set on an aumbry\
  \ shelf\nNeath crumpled boughs, aye dripping baleful mist! / On sleep-compelling\
  \ canker-worts beneath, / Black hellebore and rank-smelling deadly dwale / And bryony,\
  \ and other more, I know not well ; / The Furies\u2019 garden-knots ; whose snaky\
  \ entrailed / Locks, wrapped about my feeble knees and feet.\n[2009-07-13]"
