text: "The title for this year's Old Farmer Frack Memorial Essay has been announced.\
  \ Entrants will be challenged to write fifty thousand words under the heading \u201C\
  My Favourite Pigsty\u201D. This follows on from previous years where there was terrific\
  \ interest in subjects such as \u201CMy Favourite Cow Byre\u201D, \u201CMy Favourite\
  \ Hen Coop\u201D, and \u201CStartle the poor sheep back! is the shipwrack then a\
  \ harvest, does tempest carry the grain for thee?\u201D\nAs usual, the rules of\
  \ the contest are onerous. To commemorate Old Farmer Frack, essayists must use his\
  \ own methods, which is to say that their fifty thousand words have to be either\
  \ scraped on slates with a pointed stick, or done as Powerpoint presentations. Entrants\
  \ have to assemble in a dilapidated barn in one of Old Farmer Frack's fields before\
  \ dawn on the designated date, and before putting stick to slate or fingertip to\
  \ keyboard, each takes it in turn to drive the surviving cows down to the drainage\
  \ ditch and back, bellowing all the while. The barn will be lit by a single Toc\
  \ H lamp hanging from the rafters.\nAs soon as it starts to rain, entrants can begin\
  \ their essays, and must continue writing indefatigably save for picnic breaks.\
  \ These will take place at allotted picnicking times, under tarpaulins, in one of\
  \ the puddle-riddled fields. Contestants may not discuss the progress, content,\
  \ general thrust, or stylistic flourishes of their essays during the picnics, but\
  \ confine themselves to talk of how great Old Farmer Frack was. It is permitted\
  \ to suggest he was mad, but not too forcefully.\nJudges for this year's competition,\
  \ who will also act as invigilators in the barn, include Wilf Self, Wilf Amis, Wilfette\
  \ Winterson and Pebblehead, the bestselling paperbackist who has been commissioned\
  \ to write the authorised biography of Old Farmer Frack and is a previous winner\
  \ of the Memorial Essay prize. He won in the year the subject was \u201CMy Favourite\
  \ Pebble\u201D.\nEntry is open to peasants, their friends and families. and those\
  \ with whom they have been embroiled in rustic blood feuds reaching back for untold\
  \ generations. The winner will be announced on the Muggletonian Little Holiday,\
  \ the nineteenth of July.\nThis year's prize is a muffin, and a pair of loaded pistols.\_\
