text: "Reviewing The Elements Of Eloquence by Mark Forsythe in The Spectator, Christopher\
  \ Howse notes:\nThe shiniest piece of information I picked up is that, in English,\
  \ adjectives go in this order:\nOpinion\u2014size\u2014age\u2014shape\u2014colour\u2014\
  origin\u2014material\u2014purpose\u2014noun. So you can have a lovely little old\
  \ rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word\
  \ order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac.\nThis knowledge is implicitly\
  \ mastered by all native speakers; to see it made explicit is an enjoyable revelation,\
  \ like learning to carry a tray on the flat of your hand.\n[2013-11-30]"
