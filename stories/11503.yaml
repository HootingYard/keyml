text: "My Uncle Tom was a wine snob. He was also a swine nob, \u201Cnob\u201D of course\
  \ being shorthand for \u201Cnoble\u201D. Uncle Tom's cabin, where he spent the summer\
  \ months, as also those of autumn, winter, and spring, was next to a pig sty, and\
  \ he was a sort of Lord of the Pigs, similar in some ways to the Lord of the Flies,\
  \ but with pigs rather than flies. Which is not to say there were no flies in his\
  \ realm, for god knows they were legion. But whereas the pigs were devoted to Uncle\
  \ Tom, and considered him their Lord and Saviour, the flies showed no such obeisance.\
  \ Why would they?\nUnderneath Uncle Tom's cabin was his wine cellar, bottle after\
  \ bottle after bottle after bottle after bottle in serried horizontal ranks on his\
  \ subterranean shelving racks. He was particularly fond of cabernet sauvignon, which\
  \ had a couple of shelves all to itself. None of the pigs ever got to go down the\
  \ iron spiral staircase into the cellar. Uncle Tom did not want any of his bottles\
  \ accidentally smashed by a clumsy lumbering and perhaps terrified pig.\nUncle Tom\
  \ was a great friend of the legendary Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin. They had formed\
  \ a close bond one day in the 1950s. My uncle never betrayed any of Lev's confidences,\
  \ no matter how much I badgered him, and boy did I badger him! Whenever he felt\
  \ my badgering became too much, he pushed me into the pig sty and locked the gate\
  \ so I could not get out. You would think I would have learned my lesson, and ceased\
  \ being such a pest about Lev Yashin, but that would be to impute a semblance of\
  \ sense to me, as a child. But I had none, and there are those who say I still don't.\n\
