  \ reader Carlo Randle, who says:\nDear Frank\nA few weeks ago, I spent a grim evening\
  \ playing some kind of Lovecraft-based collaborative boardgame with friends.\nTiny\
  \ plastic figures moving about on a dark board overprinted in near-black ink; the\
  \ prolix and apparently arbitrary rules, printed not in a handy booklet but on large,\
  \ flappy sheets tacked to the inside of the presentation box lid; the various stacks\
  \ of darkly-printed hazard cards, menace cards, threat cards, jeopardy cards and\
  \ so on; the strange anomaly of the \u2018taxis\u2019 by which one's avatar might\
  \ whisk about the region's gloomy mapscape; the massiveness of the dice and their\
  \ propensity to scatter the scrawny, lightweight playing pieces from their assigned\
  \ places; the confusing indistinguishability of those playing pieces, which meant\
  \ one frequently expended all one's half-understood strategic nous on moving the\
  \ wrong character, frustrating some ultimately crucial aspect of our glacially-paced\
  \ campaign to resist or repel the Old Ones; the swiftly-escalating despair that\
  \ (a) the game could not be won by the human players, because the resources of The\
  \ Game (our opponent) were so lavishly stacked against us and (b) that it would\
  \ nevertheless take a Troublingly Long Time before our inevitable, crushing defeat\
  \ was confirmed. In that respect, I suppose, it was a truly Lovecraftian experience.\n\
  I remember my avatar's being obliged to sidle down a kind of sewer pipe from Arkham\
  \ to Dunwich, or similar, to forestall some inexpressible catastrophe which was\
  \ about to be visited on the region by a tiny plastic \u2018monster\u2019 which,\
  \ had it tumbled from one's Cornflakes packet in childhood, would have been flicked\
  \ desultorily into the pedal-bin without a second glance.\nWe lost \u2026 the game\
  \ itself was declared the winner. But I don't want to give the impression that nobody\
  \ enjoyed it. Our host was cooing with delight all evening.\nYours shudderingly,\n\
  Carlo Randle (anag.)\n[2017-07-22]"
