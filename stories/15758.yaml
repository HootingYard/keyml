  \ on the radio, for obvious reasons. The show includes rather ramshackle recitations\
  \ of From The Mountains To The Sea, A Family Of Goatherds Unparalleled In Their\
  \ Rapacity, Two Sparrows, A Person Of Unhinged Mien, Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk,\
  \ and New Verse By Dennis Beerpint.\n[2017-10-06]"
