text: "Apart from her antipathy to bananas as \u201Ca very common fruit indeed\u201D\
  , her intense devotion to Aberdeen granite as a divinely-ordained medium for tombstones\
  \ and memorials, and her devotion to the particular Queen under whom she lived,\
  \ she was, in other respects, just as true to the reign of Anne or Elizabeth as\
  \ to that of Victoria; a Shakespearian character, a nurse of all time. Although,\
  \ perhaps, she belonged to the age of Webster more than to any later one, for there\
  \ was a certain quality about her at once robust and morbid. She loved the sea,\
  \ and all its smaller fruits, shrimps, prawns, and winkles (here her aristocratic\
  \ prejudices, as evinced in her horror of bananas, broke down); she loved the lanes,\
  \ then fuller of wild flowers than of charabancs, and could name any flower, bird,\
  \ or tree with its proper English name; she loved theatres and any form of pageantry;\
  \ but more, I think, than anything, did she love to read of a murder\u2014though\
  \ it was only in the Bible\u2014visit a friend dying of some lingering disease,\
  \ or roam at her ease in a well-ordered cemetery, observing every inscribed and\
  \ floral detail\u2026 it was this woman, with her \u201Cinvincible ignorance\u201D\
  , as those responsible for the welfare of the present writer termed it\u2026 together\
  \ with the old house in the shelter of which he lived, that nevertheless joined\
  \ everyday life for him on to that of previous ages, prevented the nineteenth century\
  \ from cutting itself off entirely from the past, and provided a healthy current\
  \ of red blood to that which otherwise might have seemed a dull, bloated, yet anemic\
  \ age.\nOsbert Sitwell, in the preface to Sober Truth\_: A Collection Of Nineteenth-Century\
