text: "It is rare for me to feel imbued with the entrepreneurial spirit, but that\
  \ is what happened this morning. I had a bright idea and envisioned myself as the\
  \ onlie begetter of a vast multinational chain of snackbar franchises. All I need\
  \ do now is draw up a business plan and make an appointment to see a friendly bank\
  \ manager, who will be awed by my business nous and give me a start-up loan.\nFor\
  \ some reason I was mulling over the success of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2014a success\
  \ to which I have not myself contributed, never having entered one of these establishments.\
  \ It suddenly occurred to me that a more civilised, more seemly version would be\
  \ Dunkin\u2019 Rich Tea Biscuits. Customers would enter, sit down, and order a cup\
  \ of tea and one, or perhaps two, of these plain and virtually flavourless biscuits.\
  \ Who could resist?\n\n[2014-04-26]"
