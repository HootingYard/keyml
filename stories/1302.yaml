text: "I read in the paper today that the governors of a new primary school in Sheffield\
  \ have decided the word \u201Cschool\u201D has \u201Cnegative connotations\u201D\
  \ and it will thus be known as a \u201Cplace for learning\u201D. No doubt staff\
  \ and pupils (or whatever euphemisms they use for them) will find their way around\
  \ the place by following the \u201Cdirectional pointing devices\u201D so favoured\
  \ by John Birt when he was in charge of the BBC. I am disappointed, of course, that\
  \ they neglected to use the correct phrase for \u201Cschool\u201D, which as we know\
  \ is \u201Ccommunity education hub\u201D.\nHorace Walpole wrote that \u201CSheffield\
  \ is one of the foulest towns in England\u201D, though he did buy a pair of \u201C\
  quite pretty\u201D candlesticks while he was there.\n[2009-01-03]"
