  \ partridge stuffed with a plover stuffed with a lapwing stuffed with a quail stuffed\
  \ with a thrush stuffed with a lark stuffed with an ortolan bunting stuffed with\
  \ a garden warbler stuffed with an olive. The puckish gastronome did not actually\
  \ recommend washing this down with a brimming tumbler of fresh warm starling's blood,\
  \ but that would be appropriate.\nThis year, however, in an act of right-on cultural\
