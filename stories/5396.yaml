  \ Style (2007), I note that his film director character Rex Hanway has a cat called\
  \ Cato. This served to remind me of a personal favourite from the implausibly vast\

  \ Deficiency by Istvan Scrimgeour\_:\_ \u201CHe had two pets: a cat called Doge\
  \ and a dog called Cato.\u201D\n[2010-10-12]"
