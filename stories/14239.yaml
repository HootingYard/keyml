text: "The offing of Nitty was a terrible, terrible thing. Calamitous, according to\
  \ some. Listen, for example, to what Monsignor Pivot had to say.\nOh, this is awkward.\
  \ I thought I had a tape recording, or at least a transcript, of that good man's\
  \ peroration, delivered after Nitty was offed but before all the papers were signed\
  \ and registered and copied and placed on the public noticeboards. But where I thought\
  \ it was, in my desk drawer, now there is only dust, dust and the detached leg of\
  \ a beetle, dust and the leg of a beetle and a single paperclip.\nI find myself\
  \ wondering about the beetle and the paperclip to the exclusion of Cadet Nitty.\
  \ Yes, cadet, for before his offing he had been stripped of his captaincy. His badge\
  \ had been crushed and his epaulettes burned. But he went to his offing with all\
  \ his arms and legs intact, unlike the poor beetle. How had its leg become detached\
  \ and fetched up in my desk drawer? Where was the rest of the beetle? Did it live,\
  \ lame, or had it died? And what did the paperclip have to do with anything? Had\
  \ it clipped together papers which, like the incomplete beetle, had since gone missing?\
  \ Would Monsignor Pivot ever deliver a peroration upon the beetle and the paperclip?\n\
  No, of course he would not. He is not that kind of man, and it is not that kind\
  \ of world. Instead, it is a world where Nitty has been offed, good and proper,\
  \ never to return.\nThat saddens me, of course it does, but somehow it is not so\
  \ sad as a maimed beetle and an abandoned paperclip. I do not set the priorities,\
  \ I simply feel them, and terrible as it is I know in my bosom that Cadet Nitty\
  \ will be forgotten, and sooner rather than later, perhaps even before the cows\
  \ are driven into their byre for the night.\nI have said nothing of the dust in\
  \ the desk drawer. What should I say? Dust is dust. Nitty will be dust soon, if\
  \ the procedures are followed correctly. As I recall, in his peroration, Monsignor\
  \ Pivot took pains to stress his hope that they would be. It would only add to the\
  \ tragedy of Nitty's offing if, in its aftermath, correct procedures were neglected,\
  \ or faffed with, as can happen sometimes, shamefully, though it is nobody's fault.\
  \ Say it is \u201Cthe system\u201D, and have done with it. At the end of the day,\
  \ the cows will still be driven in to their byre.\nNow Nitty is no more, and the\
  \ world, or at least a small corner of it, is reduced to a beetle's leg and a paperclip.\
  \ The more one examines them, the more they sing of something, something motley\
  \ and intangible, as intangible as the Monsignor's lost peroration, now that I have\
  \ mislaid the tape recording and the transcript.\nI have, somewhere, some glue.\
  \ If and when I can find it, I will glue the leg of the beetle to the paperclip.\
  \ While they are still sticky, I will sprinkle them with dust, so that the dust\
  \ adheres. It is said that the Dude abides, and likewise, the dust adheres. Nitty\
  \ would have known that, and perhaps, wherever he is, may know it still.\nI push\
  \ the desk drawer shut, and light my pipe, and gaze out of the window at the crows\
  \ on the lawn. If the crows know anything, they know there will be both a harrowing\
  \ and a reckoning. Fetch my gumboots. I am going to the dormitory of monkeys.\n\
