text: "Those very sensible people at Unit have released a new double CD entitled \u201C\
  Civil Disobedience\u201D, described by the fanzine Fracture as \u201Cthe most relentlessly\
  \ depressing pop album ever released\u201D. I am delighted to tell you that it includes\
  \ a three-minute instrumental entitled \u201CLittle Severin, The Mystic Badger (For\
  \ Frank Key)\u201D which you can listen to here:\n\u266A \u266A \u266A Little Severin,\
  \ The Mystic Badger \u266A \u266A \u266A\nI would urge you to go straight to the\
  \ Unit website and buy the album, but online purchase does not appear to be possible.\
  \ Perhaps a Unit-person will add a comment telling readers how they can obtain this\
  \ essential recording.\n[2012-03-15]"
