text: "As one of the world's leading monkey-annoyance experts, I am regularly pressed\
  \ by people to give handy hints on ways to annoy monkeys. For example, I might be\
  \ leaning against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and be importuned\
  \ by a sophisticated cocktail partygoer demanding to be told how he or she might\
  \ best annoy a monkey. Invariably, I reply that I do not actually spend my time\
  \ devising ways to annoy monkeys as a hobby or pastime, but that I am in fact a\
  \ serious and dedicated scientist whose object of study is the neurological complexity\
  \ of the monkey brain. No matter how sophisticated they are, my interlocutors are\
  \ always disappointed to hear this, and move off across the drawing-room to strike\
  \ up a new cocktail party conversation with somebody more amusing than me.\nPersonally,\
  \ I can think of few activities more foolish than to deliberately annoy a monkey.\
  \ When, for example, I shut a monkey in a room with a flying squirrel, I do so in\
  \ the interests of science, not because it gives me a big belly laugh to watch how\
  \ annoyed the monkey becomes. In any case, I am too busy keeping an eye on my monkey\
  \ brain-scan monitors and other precision gubbins even to crack a smile. Now and\
  \ then, it is true, one of my research assistants might chuckle at the monkey's\
  \ annoyance, but when that happens I punch the assistant on the jaw and transfer\
  \ them to janitorial mopping duties for a week. They soon learn.\nI recall first\
  \ becoming fascinated by annoyed monkeys when I was a small child. My parents kept\
  \ a pet monkey named Harrison, and it often became annoyed. Now I realise its annoyance\
  \ was due to the presence of my parents\u2019 other pet, a flying squirrel named\
  \ Birtwistle. It took many long years of gruelling study for me to discover this.\
  \ After all, Harrison might have been annoyed by many other things, such as my father's\
  \ habit of tapping his pipe on railings, or my mother's staple gun, or my sister's\
  \ frosty icing palaver, especially on Sundays. These things annoyed me, so why should\
  \ they not annoy the monkey? Only after enrolling in a baccalaureate in monkey annoyance\
  \ at a large and important seat of learning did it begin, slowly, to dawn on me\
  \ that Birtwistle the flying squirrel could be the primary cause of Harrison the\
  \ monkey's annoyance. By the time my studies were complete, and I published my world-shuddering\
  \ paper on monkey annoyance, both the pets were dead, as were my parents. My sister,\
  \ meanwhile, had run off to an ashram with a yogi.\nI have since published several\
  \ other papers, equally brilliant, on further monkey annoyances. Now I am ready\
  \ to go beyond annoyance to rage, and am investigating advanced methods of enraging\
  \ monkeys. So if you should encounter me at a sophisticated cocktail party, oh do\
  \ not ask \u201CWhat is it?\u201D let us go and make our visit to the enraged monkey\
  \ lab, where you can see for yourself how tirelessly I probe the inner workings\
  \ of the monkey brain, and your brain too, if your brain resembles that of a monkey,\
  \ which it probably does, judging by the people I meet at the sophisticated cocktail\
  \ parties to which I am invited.\nNow off you go and read the Christian Science\
  \ Monitor.\n(Thanks to Glyn Webster for alerting me to this important news item.)\n\
