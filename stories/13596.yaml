text: "I was exceedingly pleased to receive as a Christmas gift The New Annotated\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft, a splendid scholarly edition of selected works by the troubled\
  \ genius of Providence, Rhode Island. It is packed with informative footnotes, but\
  \ one was missing, so I am taking the opportunity to provide it here as an addendum.\n\
  Among my favourite snippets of Lovecraft is this passage from The Thing On The Doorstep.\
  \ My footnote is appended.\nIt began with a telephone call just before midnight.\
  \ I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the library. No\
  \ one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my\
  \ ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying\
  \ under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid\
  \ bubbling noise\u2014\u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub\u201D\u2014which had an odd\
  \ suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called\
  \ \u201CWho is it?\u201D But the only answer was \u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub-glub.\u201D\
  \nNOTE\_: In the early 1990s, \u201CGlub \u2026 glub \u2026 glub\u201D was the recorded\
  \ answerphone message of Ed Baxter, benevolent despot of ResonanceFM.\n[2014-12-26]"
