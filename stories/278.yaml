text: "Blodgett had a certain militaristic cast to his character, so when he was given\
  \ command of a pocket battleship it was understandable that he got slightly carried\
  \ away. He fretted and fussed over his epaulettes and other trimmings of his uniform\
  \ to a somewhat embarrassing degree, so much so that he neglected more critical\
  \ aspects of his duty such as keeping a proper log. Thus it is that we do not have\
  \ a reliable record of his one and only voyage.\nThis was a time of gunboat diplomacy,\
  \ and Blodgett's mission was to anchor his ship in a faraway bay, train his guns\
  \ on the coast, and to threaten to blow the township there to smithereens unless\
  \ certain conditions were met. All very straightforward, or it would have been had\
  \ the ship not had for its navigator a man who had lost his wits. This fellow's\
  \ name was Trubshaw, and it is a wonder that he still had the confidence of the\
  \ Admiralty, for he had been bonkers for years. Instead of steering the ship towards\
  \ the faraway bay, Trubshaw pored over his charts and barked instructions through\
  \ a pneumatic funnel that led to the ship becoming encased in pack ice thousands\
  \ of nautical miles away from its proper destination. There was no township upon\
  \ which to train the guns, leaving Blodgett at a loss what to do, other than to\
  \ preen his epaulettes and other trimmings with a little brush.\nTrubshaw, meanwhile,\
  \ was following his own demented star. He took to pacing up and down the poop deck\
  \ shouting at the sky. Icicles formed on the brim of his navigator's cap, but he\
  \ seemed impervious to the cold. Not so the rest of the crew, huddled below decks\
  \ wrapped in blankets and keeping their spirits up by playing board games and eating\
  \ sausages. Blodgett kept to his cabin, using his log as a pad for doodling. He\
  \ had lost radio contact with the Admiralty weeks ago. There was nothing for it\
  \ but to sit the winter out and wait for the ice to melt.\nAt this point, I expect\
  \ the majority of readers will be avid for further details of the board games and\
  \ the sausages, and I will not disappoint. However, before dealing with those crucial\
  \ topics, perhaps it is wise to say a few more words about Trubshaw. His insanity\
  \ was not in doubt, but what has never been established is whether he deliberately\
  \ stranded the ship in Antarctic waters, or whether within the vaporous murk of\
  \ his mad brain he honestly believed the ship was heading for that faraway bay.\
  \ There may be a clue in the words he was shouting at the sky while pacing the poop\
  \ deck, and by chance we do have a record, albeit fragmentary, of what they were,\
  \ or some of them at least. By chance an airship packed to the gills with the very\
  \ latest magnetic cylinder recording technology passed overhead one day, and some\
  \ of Trubshaw's shouting was picked up by its monitors and etched onto a cylinder,\
  \ preserved forever. If you get a special coupon for entry to the sound recordings\
  \ rooms of the Museum At-Or-Near-Ack-On-The-Vug, you can listen to this bewildering\
  \ caterwaul. Dobson once planned a pamphlet on Blodgett's voyage, and transcribed\
  \ part of Trubshaw's tirade, but abandoned the essay in favour of his justly famous\
  \ Bilgewater Elegies. Thanks to Dobson, though, we can reprint the shouting, and\
  \ gain an eerie insight into the crackbrained navigator pacing the poop deck of\
  \ that ice-girt pocket battleship so many, many years ago.\n\u201CWheat! Bulgar\
  \ wheat!\u201D begins the Dobson transcription, \u201CWheat and gravel and sand\
  \ and grit! Powdered paste! Paste in puddles! Gravel and sand a-criminy! Pitch and\
  \ tar and globules of black, black, blackened goo! Cracking pods squelching underfoot!\
  \ Pods of ooze and glue! Pitted black olives in a jar, pitted and black like a black\
  \ pit! Cracked bulgar wheat and cracking sand! Black pudding! Vinegar down your\
  \ throat! Malt and muck underfoot in vast paste puddles of goo!\u201D\nIt is difficult\
  \ to know precisely what to make of this, except to conclude that Trubshaw was completely\
  \ off his head and that, charts and barked instructions to the crew notwithstanding,\
  \ navigation was not uppermost in his mind. That being so, we can get on to the\
  \ more diverting business of the board games and the sausages, as promised.\nThe\
  \ ship's cook was a follower of the dietary theories of Canspic Ougat, and that\
  \ being the case there was little if any animal flesh in his sausages. One might,\
  \ when munching, occasionally sink one's teeth into a fragment of pig or goat or\
  \ starling, but only a tiny fragment, often so tiny as to go unnoticed. The cook\
  \ made his sausages from an Ougat-approved compaction of mashed up turnips and marshland\
  \ reeds and grasses, leavened with some sort of secret curd. They came in two sizes,\
  \ jumbo and cocktail, although the latter were not served on cocktail sticks due\
  \ to Ougat's stern prohibition of sausage-piercing. Holes, even the very wee ones\
  \ made by the average cocktail stick, were anathema to the dietician, for reasons\
  \ propounded in the preface to his magisterial Codex Sausageiana. Even if you are\
  \ not particularly interested in sausages, this book is a fantastic read, and I\
  \ cannot recommend it too enthusiastically. I try to read a few paragraphs every\
  \ day, much as some people dip daily into the Bible, or into Prudence Foxglove's\
  \ Winsome Thoughts For The Dull-Witted. Much of the ship's cargo hold was occupied\
  \ by the cook's crates of sausage ingredients, and he was forever puffing and blustering\
  \ about his galley, kneading the turnip and marshland reeds and grasses and secret\
  \ curd and occasional bits of pig and goat and starling into the sausages in which\
  \ he took such pride, inspecting every single one with a powerful microscope to\
  \ ensure that it was free of even the most minuscule hole. And of course, the crew\
  \ gobbled them down greedily at mealtimes, both jumbo and cocktail varieties, for\
  \ they had nothing else to eat. That's quite enough about sausages.\nBlodgett had\
  \ made it a condition of his command of the pocket battleship that it be stocked\
  \ with lots and lots of board games. And so three entire cupboards below the orlop\
  \ deck were stacked with them, from family favourites such as Plutocrat!, Dentist's\
  \ Potting Shed and To The Finland Station to more obscure games like Treat The Dropsy\
  \ With Leeches, Butcher's Shop Railings, and Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol Cement\
  \ Running Track Challenge Cup Heat Four. On the rare occasions he popped his head\
  \ into the cabin where the crew huddled together for warmth through that freezing\
  \ polar winter, Blodgett was always pleased to see that they were kept fully occupied\
  \ by one board game or another. The gang of sailcloth patchers took particular pleasure\
  \ in Patch That Sail!, a fast and furious yet at times slow-moving game involving\
  \ equal measures of cunning and luck. The board itself represented a piece of sailcloth,\
  \ and indeed was made of sailcloth, and the players took it in turns, by throwing\
  \ dice and moving their counters, to patch up the various rips and rents in the\
  \ cloth with needle and thread. Meanwhile, over in one corner of the cabin, Blodgett\
  \ was sure to find the crows\u2019 nest men playing a sprightly game of Groaning\
  \ Widow, a contest so fiendishly complicated that only the superior brainpans of\
  \ the crows\u2019 nest men had a chance of understanding it. Other, less bright\
  \ sailors would watch, gawping, for hours, as counters flew around the board, spinners\
  \ were spun, card-packs consulted, and little plasticine models of characters from\
  \ The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann were put in place, knocked over, taken to pieces,\
  \ remodelled, repainted, and had the heads pulled off them and substituted with\
  \ special bonus tokens. Only a fresh pan of sausages from the galley would interrupt\
  \ the crows\u2019 nest men's concentration, when they would sulkily take a break\
  \ to feed, having taken snapshots of the board from several different angles to\
  \ prevent cheating.\nAnd so the winter wore on, until one day the ice melted away\
  \ and the pocket battleship sailed home. Trubshaw had abandoned ship by this time,\
  \ stomping off across the ice floes in curiously subdued fashion, no longer shouting\
  \ at the sky, his face barely visible behind the thick row of icicles dangling from\
  \ the brim of his cap, stooping occasionally to pluck some kind of primitive edible\
  \ life form from the cold, cold sea with his fur-bemittened fist. Blodgett watched\
  \ from the prow of the battleship as his navigator vanished into the white nothingness.\
  \ Weeks later, they began the return voyage, guided by the stars, which one of the\
  \ crows\u2019 nest men knew how to read.\nBlodgett was of course hauled before an\
  \ Admiralty Star Chamber to account for himself. Why had he failed to sail to the\
  \ faraway bay for a spot of gung ho gunboat diplomacy? He burbled and babbled and\
  \ preened his epaulettes and other trimmings, but at no point did he ever mention\
  \ Trubshaw. He had even expunged the navigator's name from the list of crew pinned\
  \ up on a post at the entrance to the Star Chamber, and inevitably there was no\
  \ reference to Trubshaw in Blodgett's hopelessly inadequate captain's log. Which,\
  \ I suppose, begs the question: did Trubshaw ever actually exist? Or was he a wraith\
  \ or phantom, or even a ghoul, of the kind known to haunt ships of the line as they\
  \ ply the oceans, sailing round and round and round, into the maelstrom?\n[2007-11-07]"
