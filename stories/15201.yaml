text: "Modern cinema is in a sorry state. Increasingly, it seems Hollywood is only\
  \ interested in witless superhero franchises, so the same film is recycled time\
  \ and time again, with ever diminishing returns. These are films for adolescents,\
  \ not adults, and such basic elements as plot, character, and genuine drama are\
  \ sacrificed in the interests of mere spectacle. Why bother with, say, snappy dialogue\
  \ when the audience will be happy with an endless series of big noisy explosions?\n\
  Which makes it all the more puzzling that Hollywood has thus far neglected the one\
  \ superhero who I would love to see depicted on the big screen. I am talking, of\
  \ course, of Piffleboy. Piffleboy was the creation of maverick comic-book genius\
  \ Lars Talc, and his adventures were recounted, between March and July 1974, in\
  \ the pages of the now extremely rare Piffleboy! comic.\nSet in a generic American\
  \ metropolis, the stories tell of a young mild-mannered milksop who is passionately\
  \ devoted to his button collection. Yet he has a secret life as a crime-fighter,\
  \ righting wrongs, taking out the hoodlums, and keeping the city streets safe. He\
  \ does this by using his superpower, with which he was imbued following a bizarre\
  \ chemical reaction caused by some of the buttons in his collection being dropped\
  \ in a puddle.\nPiffleboy's superpower is an ability to spout absolute piffle, extempore\
  \ and at length, which drives those listening crackers, leaving them confused and\
  \ befuddled, like decapitated chickens. In a typical adventure, Piffleboy will be\
  \ sitting at home with his buttons when he receives an alert on his Pifflephone,\
  \ telling him that ne'er-do-wells are bent on villainy somewhere in the city. Immediately,\
  \ Piffleboy minces to the scene, and starts babbling utter piffle. The evil miscreants\
  \ are soon reduced to a state of discombobulation, whereupon the coppers arrive\
  \ and drag them, unprotesting, off to prison.\nEach episode ends with the captain\
  \ of detectives saying \u201CGee, thanks Piffleboy! If it weren't for you we'd never\
  \ have rounded up these hoods and made the city safe again!\u201D to which Piffleboy\
  \ replies \u201CGlad to be of service, captain. Now I must get back to my buttons\u201D\
  .\nDevoted fans of Piffleboy memorise long passages of his most piffling piffle\
  \ and meet at conventions where they recite it to each other in loud yet curiously\
  \ weedy voices.\nLars Talc was taught by the noted hyperrealist artist Rex Hyper,\
  \ and not the least of the charms of the Piffleboy! comics are his hyperrealist\
  \ illustrations, one of which is reproduced below. This shows Piffleboy in the immediate\
  \ aftermath of the famous episode in which he foils the criminal schemes of bootlegger\
  \ Slugger McGrew and his gang by wittering piffle at them for several hours until\
  \ the tardy cops eventually show up.\n\n[2017-02-01]"
