text: "\nThe willow warbler is a type of bird. As its name suggests, it hangs around\
  \ in the vicinity of willow trees and it warbles. In the notebook you keep in a\
  \ waterproof pochette on a lanyard around your neck, there is probably a page headed\
  \ Birds Beginning With \u201CW\u201D I Have Seen, on which you have written a list\
  \ of birds beginning with \u201CW\u201D. When you see one of these birds, you either\
  \ make a tick next to the name, or cross it out, decisively, with your propelling\
  \ pencil. In order to achieve this result for the willow warbler, then, you need\
  \ to be near willow trees, or possibly just one willow tree. And you also need to\
  \ listen out for warbling.\nIf there are no willow trees in sight, and you cannot\
  \ hear anything resembling a warble, you are very unlikely to spot a willow warbler.\
  \ The first thing to do, then, is to get yourself close to some willows. Do not\
  \ forget to take your binoculars with you, unless you are blessed with uncommonly\
  \ piercing vision, in which case you probably have not bothered to buy, or rent,\
  \ a pair of binoculars.\nIt may be that you live far, oh! so far, from any willows,\
  \ and congenital infirmity forbids you from lengthy travel. In such circumstances,\
  \ you need not give up all hope of spotting a willow warbler. The thing to do is\
  \ to obtain, and plant in the ground in your garden, some willow saplings. If you\
  \ do not have a garden, choose a patch of commons as close to your domain as possible,\
  \ and plant the saplings there. You will, of course, have to wait some years for\
  \ the saplings to grow into the kind of lush verdant willow trees likely to attract\
  \ a willow warbler, but while you wait you can spend profitable time reading up\
  \ on the bird, so you can be all the more certain you know one when you see one.\
  \ And of course, reading books about birds can be done in the comfort of your armchair,\
  \ if you have one, and you need not strain your feeble and debilitated limbs. If\
  \ you do not have an armchair, you can simply sprawl on the floor.\nSeveral other\
  \ types of birds are known to hang around in the vicinity of willows. This is where\
  \ your ability to recognise the warbling of a willow warbler becomes critical. Bear\
  \ in mind, however, that not only do several other types of birds lurk in the willows,\
  \ but several other types of birds also warble. I am not going to give you a complete,\
  \ or even a partial, list of such birds, so do not ask. What you need to do is learn\
  \ the distinctive warbling sound made by the willow warbler, which differentiates\
  \ it from other warbling birds. There might be some tape recordings in your local\
  \ lending library, or you can interrogate an ornithologist.\nAfter much diligent\
  \ study, you should be able to recognise the willow warbler with both your eyes\
  \ and your ears. What you then have to do is drag yourself towards the patch of\
  \ willows, peer intently and prick up your ears, and wait for a bird to appear that\
  \ matches both the sight and sound of the willow warbler insofar as you have rammed\
  \ those concepts into your head. You can then take your notebook out of its pochette,\
  \ flip to the required page, and either tick or cross out the name of the bird.\n\
  As we have seen, depending on your physical robustness, or lack thereof, this may\
  \ take many years to accomplish. But, boy oh boy, it will be worth it, with icing\
  \ on top!\nThis is a second extract from Mr Key's Book Of Birds, a work in progress.\n\
