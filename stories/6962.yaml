  touches are put to your favourite book of the year, the annual Hooting Yard paperback.

  Meanwhile, never resting on our laurels, and determined always to extend our global
  reach, possibly into extraterrestrial zones, the thought occurred to present one
  of the new and gorgeous Hooting Yard lapel accoutrements to a living luminary. This
  lucky luminary could then act as our ambassador when hobnobbing with the great and
  good and with that Fry person. But upon which luminary should we bestow this signal
  honour? Readers, you decide!
