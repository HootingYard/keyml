text: "After I posted the piece entitled Denktash Fugue Syndrome, in which mention\
  \ is made of Mrs Gubbins and her knitted tea cosies, I was deluged with mail from\
  \ younger readers who complained that they had no idea what I was talking about.\
  \ The general tone of these missives was along the lines of \u201COi, Mr Key, what\
  \ in the name of heaven is a tea cosy, for crying out loud, innit?\u201D\nIt would\
  \ appear that today's youth have been seduced by something called \u201Ctea in a\
  \ bag\u201D, and no longer make use of teapots and, thus, of tea cosies. This is\
  \ a sorry state of affairs. However, here at Hooting Yard we occasionally make attempts\
  \ to be \u201Cwith it\u201D and \u201Cgroovy\u201D, so we decided to track down\
  \ some of these so-called \u201Ctea bags\u201D and see what all the fuss is about.\n\
  Our delegated rapporteur, decked out in trendy East European clothing, strode manfully\
  \ into an indoor retail-and-leisure consumer park and, selecting a boutique at random,\
  \ went up to a counter and said, politely yet forcefully, \u201CI would like a bag\
  \ with tea in it, please\u201D. He had chosen an inappropriate boutique to make\
  \ such a request, however, for the only bags for sale at this counter were empty\
  \ ones, with handles, made of leather or plastic or cotton or the pelts of various\
  \ endangered animals. Surmising, not unreasonably, that bag and tea had to be purchased\
  \ separately, our doughty rapporteur picked from the display a small dimity pippy\
  \ bag and, having paid the criminally expensive asking price with his Hooting Yard\
  \ Card\u2122, made off along the rattling pneumatic pedestrian express walkarama\
  \ in search of somewhere to buy tea.\nLocating an emporium packed to the gills with\
  \ grocery items, our chap hunted the aisles until he found a cardboard box of shredded\
  \ tea leaves. After paying for this at a bleeping self-service console, he wasted\
  \ no time in ripping open the box with his gnarled fingers, until it looked as if\
  \ it had been savaged by a squirrel. He then poured the contents of the box into\
  \ the pippy bag.\nThe next step was to eke from the bag a lovely cup of piping hot\
  \ tea, so our rapporteur repaired to a yard where he knew he would find an outside\
  \ spigot. Holding the pippy bag open under the spigot, he filled it with brackish\
  \ water, then zipped it shut. He then caught the bus back to Haemoglobin Towers,\
  \ where Mrs Gubbins was waiting with her array of giant bunsen burners. Using a\
  \ contraption of coat-hangers to suspend the pippy bag over the fearsome flames,\
  \ crone and rapporteur waited for the tell-tale sight of steam escaping from the\
  \ partly-unzipped bag to alert them that the bag's innards were coming to the boil.\
  \ From there, it was a simple matter of detaching the bag from its coat-hangers\
  \ and placing it under a tea cosy. Of course, Mrs Gubbins used a pair of heat-resistant\
  \ padded mittens to perform this action.\nGiving the infusion a few minutes to brew,\
  \ the rapporteur then borrowed the mittens from La Gubbins, fully unzipped the pippy\
  \ bag, and upturned it, sloshing the tea inside into a couple of dainty tea cups.\
  \ There was a little spillage, but that was soon mopped up by a passing factotum\
  \ armed with a mop and a pail. A dash of milk added, and the duo sat on a threadbare\
  \ ottoman to enjoy their well-earned cuppa.\nAll in all, and in spite of the sterling\
  \ efforts of both the rapporteur and Mrs Gubbins, this seems to be a frankly foolish\
  \ way of obtaining a cup of tea, and it is not an experiment we will be repeating.\n\
