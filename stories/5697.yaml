text: "I am delighted to report that there is a school in this land, or perhaps in\
  \ another land, where a pedagogue uses Impugned By A Peasant & Other Stories as\
  \ a teaching text. A class of young teenpersons was supplied with tales from the\
  \ book and asked to provide a brief introduction and an additional paragraph as\
  \ an imitation or extension of the prose. My understanding is that their work was\
  \ intended to be read aloud, rather than as finished pieces of writing. Herewith\
  \ some of their contributions. A second selection will follow. [N.B. sic throughout.]\n\
  Woodcutter\nThe characters consist of The Woodcutter, The Charcoal burner, The Popinjay,\
  \ and the Creatures of The Wood.\nThe story is about a woodcutter. This woodcutter\
  \ has a \u201Cburning sense of injustice\u201D and doesn't like talking to people\
  \ or letting them visit. He has hatched a plan to take over the forest by training\
  \ some forest creatures which he had stolen from a nest of a forest being matriarch.\
  \ And taking over the forest. While the charcoal burner and the popinjay have a\
  \ plan to get back at the woodcutter. But they are all oblivious of the fact that\
  \ the eggs are hatching below them in the cellar. And the woodcutter also doesn't\
  \ know that the creatures, (who can grow to the size of trees) cannot be trained.\n\
  The tone is rather descriptive, especially of the creature. \u201CCreaky and crumpled\
  \ and covered in hoar frost\u201D or \u201Ccan grow to the size of trees.\u201D\
  \ From the extract, it also makes the story sound like the creatures are going to\
  \ kill the woodcutter, the popinjay, and the charcoal burner. Although from the\
  \ extract I don't know what will happen to them. But again, the tone is rather suggestive\
  \ that there is no hope for the other creatures in the wood and the strange forest\
  \ beings are going to destroy everything.\nAlthough the story sounds rather dark\
  \ and makes the future look gloomy, the title is called \u201CThe Woodcutter\u201D\
  \ so I would imagine he has a further part to play yet. Personally. I think this\
  \ would be and interesting and enjoyable to read. And I think I would probably buy\
  \ this book. Although I found it hard to grasp the whole idea of the storyline at\
  \ first, after reading it through a couple more times I began to grasp the idea\
  \ of it.\nA Trip From Throm To Bosis\nThe \u201CLord\u201D, described in paragraphs\
  \ 2 and 3, was often mistaken as the \u201CGod of the Christians,\u201D but in fact\
  \ he was a native of Throm, and is thought to have dug the \u201Cvery first shaft\
  \ of what was to become the fantastic sewage system.\u201D\nClothgard, a Bosisite\
  \ of the highest peasantry, the very person who was entrusted with the Lord's sack\
  \ full of all the insects in the world. She is instructed to \u201Ctake this sack\
  \ and throw it into the sea.\u201D\nThe tone is very inflated, with this small event,\
  \ the meeting between the Lord and Clothgard, being exaggerated to make it seem\
  \ as if it was some spectacular event which changed the course of history. This\
  \ whole event is summed up by the sentence at the beginning of the fifth paragraph\
  \ \u201CThus is the close link between Throm and Bosis explained.\u201D The close\
  \ in that extract is the word which led me to this conclusion, because without it,\
  \ this phrase could mean anything from extremely close link to a weak link between\
  \ these two places.\nImitation:\nBut this was not the end of this tale, for the\
  \ Lord had many adventures in the lands in and around Throm. One day a small man\
  \ of whom if any smaller, would be classified as a dwarf. His beard was followed\
  \ by a swarm of flies, which acted as a shroud that covered his jaw and mouth. His\
  \ hair appeared to contain red mud of the highlands of which Throm and Bosis were\
  \ first erected. His clothes were no more than rags draped over his small, bony\
  \ frame. His skin was pale, with flecks of mud and horse faeces. His voice was surprisingly\
  \ deep for meagre height.\nAdvice Regarding Vinegar\nI think the tone of this piece\
  \ is comical. The story itself is based on a strange subject but written in a very\
  \ serious way which, I think, is what makes it so outrageous and indeed so funny.\
  \ \u2018When the cows come home they may be disconcerted to find you in their meadow,\
  \ with your tilted head, and some of them may become fractious.\u2019 This is a\
  \ good example of the strange topic and serious feel that the author has given and\
  \ as a result has created something that is so funny.\nThe whole piece revolves\
  \ around how to deal with the certain problems which arise when one is having an\
  \ acolyte pour vinegar into one's ear. However, the reasons or benefits of having\
  \ this done are never actually explained.\nIt is not totally uncommon for the acolyte\
  \ to miss your ear, resulting in too little or none of the vinegar actually entering\
  \ the ear. Should this happen, it is advisable for you to return home having the\
  \ other acolytes carry both you and the vinegar-pouring acolyte, as he may be in\
  \ such a state that he is unable to walk himself. Actively choosing to stay in the\
  \ field may be dangerous to you and to the cows, if they did decide to come home,\
  \ as the vinegar-pouring acolyte may become so distressed that he may begin to scream.\
  \ For anyone who has never heard a vinegar-pouring acolyte scream, it is a bit like\
  \ a cross between nails being scraped down a black board and the spine-tingling\
  \ sound of cotton wool as it is pulled apart, but a thousand times louder. I do\
  \ not wish this experience upon anyone, not even my worst enemy.\nWhile you are\
  \ in the cows\u2019 field, led on your side, with your head tilted and an acolyte\
  \ is pouring vinegar into your ear, you may wonder why. This is a perfectly reasonable\
  \ thing to wonder, after all, you are led in a field, on your side while an acolyte\
  \ is pouring vinegar in your ear. The only problem being, there will be nobody with\
  \ you who is able to answer this question, except possibly the cows if they did\
  \ decide to come home and even if they did, I wouldn't imagine they would be able\
  \ to answer this question. Let's face it; there is nothing worse than going to huge\
  \ amounts of efforts such as the effort of arranging this whole process and then\
  \ wondering why on earth you did it and what benefits you will receive; so I will\
  \ tell you.\nUpon entering the ear, the vinegar travels along the ear canal and\
  \ coats the ear drum. This will result in the sweet sound of ant's feet pattering\
  \ ever so gently over a sticky surface but louder, as if they are actually in your\
  \ ear. Of course, this is because they are in your ear. They would have been attracted\
  \ by the scent of the vinegar and gather in their hundreds there.\nIf you are not\
  \ careful, this could lead to other small bugs being attracted, and then spiders,\
  \ and then small birds, and then cats, and dogs, and so on. To prevent this, I would\
  \ recommend ear muffs, or even better, an old piece of net curtain stapled to the\
  \ outside of your ear.\nBinder: The 49 Symphonies\nThis piece of writing, in my\
  \ opinion, could be called a poem or a story. It is set out like a story in the\
  \ way that one sentence follows another but it could be described like a poem because\
  \ there is repetition of the numbers in almost every sentence and when I read this\
  \ it was easier to read than the normal tone of writing of a story.\nIt is about\
  \ a man called Binder and his 49 symphonies. Most of it contains a list of the symphonies\
  \ with each one being described a little. Binder's character is rather odd based\
  \ on what his symphonies contain. For example symphony number seventeen ends with\
  \ the cracking of a plank. This is strange because the cracking of a plank is not\
  \ usually associated with symphonies or music.\nThis poem is comical because it\
  \ is strange. It manages to put sentences next to each other that don't link but\
  \ at the same time being funny. For example \u2018The twenty-second has to be heard\
  \ through a hat with flaps. The twenty-third is obstinate, like a mule.\nDisfigured\
  \ Nuncio\nThe tone of this piece of writing is serious yet it has a very distinctive\
  \ flavour; it is funny but supremely bizarre. It expects you to understand precisely\
  \ what it's talking about: \u201CSo when, on that blistering Thursday at the dog-end\
  \ of August, my factotae announced that a nuncio had come to see me,\u201D but I\
  \ mainly didn't. The author writes this piece as the narrator; it is strange to\
  \ a reader like me because it uses a wide range of vocabulary that is either foreign\
  \ words or just words that are hardly ever used in my dialogue.\nThe characters\
  \ in the piece range from a disfigured nuncio to the narrator's dad, who emptied\
  \ his bank account \u201Cand fled to Uruguay with his floozie.\u201D The narrator\
  \ of the story doesn't trust anybody, after what his dad did, and when the nuncio\
  \ comes to him he is rather quick to make the assumption that this nuncio would\
  \ be \u201Cof the Papal sort\u201D, which, at the time, made no sense to me, it\
  \ only made sense after I had finished the story and I had put two and two together.\
  \ The range of characters is vast, something I have been told never to do when writing\
  \ a story, keep it simple, as I was always told. But this writer breaks this rule,\
  \ as the story gets stranger by the paragraph.\nThe world in the story I read, is\
  \ rather strange; it includes strange people who carry messages to each other, which\
  \ shows a lack in technology, unlike our world. The place the story is set, I believe\
  \ it is Rome, is very religious. The narrator talks about his practising religion\
  \ and his thoughts on the nuncio's religion.\nA paragraph I have written to slip\
  \ into the story somewhere:\nI first met Ned, Ned and Ned when I was exploring the\
  \ possibility of hiring a top-of-the range factotae, I didn't know what to expect,\
  \ as the human race outside of my own four walls are a weird lot, they are corrupt\
  \ and evil, and spending time with them is like a trip to the waxing parlour. I\
  \ visited a \u201Cvisitor's centre\u201D in the vague hope of finding somebody on\
  \ my wavelength, but three strange men waddled up to me and I knew they were the\
  \ ones, I named them Ned, all of them. My three little factotums fill me with the\
  \ heavenly joy that all semi-human beings deserve; their miserable faces, ruffed-up\
  \ clothing and long forgotten feelings just fill me with glee.\nImpugned By A Peasant\n\
  The tone of this piece of writing seems sarcastically serious, as it describes what\
  \ is happening in great detail, but with words not normally used by the average\
  \ person. For example, it uses impugned, invective, and argot, all of which are\
  \ not used on a day to day basis by most people. The subject is quite different\
  \ from most books which makes it compelling to read, as it is unexpected. For example,\
  \ during the piece is the sentence \u201CWould my peasant still be there? Would\
  \ he impugn me again?\u201D. Another interesting point to make would be that the\
  \ time in which this is set is rather confused. This is shown because the man in\
  \ the story is wearing a cravat, something normally associated with the sixteenth\
  \ to seventeenth centuries, and he has a bouffant, a hair style that was very popular\
  \ in the eighteenth century. He also however talks about the book Death in Venice\
  \ which was written in 1912, and Love And Death On Long Island, which was written\
  \ in 1990. This makes me think that either this person is living in a parallel world\
  \ in which the timings of these particular things collide, or he is simply very\
  \ old fashioned in his style of dress.\nThe main character in the story has been\
  \ written to speak in a way that people do not normally speak. He also seems very\
  \ self obsessed, as he likes to \u201Cprimp his bouffant, and modify his trudge\
  \ to a flouncing prance\u201D. This is odd as he becomes so engrossed with the peasant\
  \ who is so filthy and ancient. That is the twist is the story, the way in which\
  \ he is different from the average human being. I think that however great he thinks\
  \ he is he still isn't pleased with himself. For example, after being impugned by\
  \ the peasant, he says that he is a milksop (a timid and indecisive person), and\
  \ a weakling. At the end of this story our character tells us about a model that\
  \ he built of this peasant. This is a bizarre twist, because why would you want\
  \ to remind yourself in so much detail of a time which was very humiliating? I believe\
  \ that he does this because he wants to remember that day exactly as it was. He\
  \ wants to remember becoming so obsessed with something so different from himself.\n\
  The very next day, after meeting my peasant, I returned to see if had come back\
  \ to inhabit his fence, or if would simply be those impossibly attractive youngsters.\
  \ As I approached, my mouth dry with unwanted anticipation, I found myself almost\
  \ praying for his presence. His filthy clothes and hair almost seemed attractive\
  \ as I saw him in my minds eye, walking between those aspens and larches.\nChucking\
  \ Out Time At The Cow And Pins\nI read through \u201CChucking Out Time At The Cow\
  \ And Pins\u201D with little difficulty, except for a few unknown words. E.g. salubrious.\
  \ The feel of the story is satirical and shows the way that pubs change under new\
  \ \u201Cmanagement\u201D. The story starts off by describing the pub as it was;\
  \ this is very brief. The story then continues to describe its current owner Babinsky.\
  \ He was an ex-customer who now operates the pub due to the fact that the killed\
  \ the old owner \u201Cchopping up the existing incumbent with an axe and feeding\
  \ him to the pigs\u201D. He is also described as being \u201Cpsychopathic\u201D\
  .\nThe second chapter shows the way that the pub itself changes under new management;\
  \ it's primarily bad changes. Babinsky starts with the decorations, the \u201Cshowbiz\
  \ memorabilia\u201D which are all taken down and replaced with psychotic scribblings.\
  \ This is being satirical by talking about the way that pubs change the traditional\
  \ decor into what some would describe as \u201Cmodern tat\u201D After describing\
  \ this Key continues with the jukebox. It shows the way that Babinsky smashes the\
  \ jukebox with his axe and changes its output to the screams of hell. This is satirical\
  \ of the way that pubs change their music into newer things for good or for worse\u2026\
  \ it continues along these lines. From the way that pubs change from their usual\
  \ brew into a new modern \u201Cbilge\u201D.\nInput\nUpstairs, Babinsky took his\
  \ axe and smashed all of the beds and chairs and nailed the pieces together in a\
  \ huge, twisted totem, upon which he would carve a chunk out for every person he\
  \ killed. And would hammer in another nail for every night that he survived the\
  \ rounds of the\nFrom Wivenhoe to Cuxhaven By Way Of Ponders End\nThis is one of\
  \ the short stories written by Frank Key. This story was odd; the storyline was\
  \ not completely told which left you confused to why the main character had to get\
  \ to Cuxhaven and the subject changed randomly, for example \u2018Should the bees\
  \ in Cuxhaven have at me with their stings. I hoped they would not, for I resolve\
  \ not to take their honey. In Cuxhaven, I had sausages.\u2019\nKey uses unusual\
  \ language for everyday objects; this makes the story harder to understand, but\
  \ it also makes it more interesting, for example \u2018Other than the sea crossing,\
  \ for which I commandeered the skiff and its skiffer.\u2019 This adds character\
  \ to the story. The story also concentrates on things that people normally find\
  \ completely irrelevant, for example \u2018When it was humid my goggles steamed\
  \ up. I carried on walking, as if in a mist.\u2019\nKey also uses the towns Wivenhoe\
  \ and Cuxhaven. I think that he chose these places because they both have large\
  \ names with complicated sounds; also these places are not very well know so they\
  \ could be invented by the author. It is only when you research these towns that\
  \ you realise how far away they really are; Wivenhoe is in Essex and Cuxhaven is\
  \ in north Germany.\nThis story was based on one character and his journey from\
  \ Wivenhoe to Cuxhaven. He seems to be very odd, carrying a bicycle pump to blow\
  \ away midges and a wooden god to beseech whenever his goggles steam up.\nImitation:\n\
  I had paid the skiffer an extra pouch of honey to skiff me faster. He was so easily\
  \ persuaded; the honey that I had kept aside had clearly done me a large amount\
  \ of good. Once the skiffer had skiffed me across the sea I hurried towards Cuxhaven.\
  \ I had no time to take in the sights of my travels for I had to get to Cuxhaven\
  \ in time. Instead I fantasised about the things that awaited me in Cuxhaven; the\
  \ sights, the people and the sausages. I'd never been so excited in my life.\nWith\
  \ My Fife and My Drum\nWhen I first read this story I found it imaginative, \u201C\
  I was happy in the hills until I was attacked by a flock of putti\u201D, but still\
  \ realistic at the same time, \u201CI took shelter in a recently-vacated bivouac\u201D\
  . I think that it is aimed to be an interesting folk story because it shows how\
  \ you can be rewarded and it contains parts that are like folk stories, \u201Cwith\
  \ my fife and my drum I wandered in the hills\u201D. I could see it being passed\
  \ down traditionally through word of mouth, through many generations. This story\
  \ is very interesting and to my surprise, it was very gripping. When I first saw\
  \ the title I thought that it would be a boring and diary styled piece but in fact\
  \ it was very well written. This story is based upon the real world, \u201CI was\
  \ wondering in the hills, for I had been banished from town\u201D, but it still\
  \ contains parts where it is completely unreal, \u201CI was attacked by a flock\
  \ of putti.\u201D\nThe main character is calm, \u201CI accepted this and wandered\
  \ into the hills,\u201D and he/she seems to be reasonably annoying and talkative,\
  \ \u201CIt was an actual line\u201D. He/She narrates in a chatty tone, \u201CI am\
  \ as happy as a sandboy, although I am not entirely sure what a sandboy is\u201D\
  , and I like the way that the author has kept the main character private so that\
  \ you can imagine how they look but at the same time have given you characteristics\
  \ and the attitude of this character. This is a good balance between your own imagination\
  \ and views and how the author is conveying the feel of the character, this then\
  \ influences the feel/tone of the story. Without the characters annoying tone the\
  \ story would be uninteresting and repetitive. This character also seems intelligent\
  \ or at least they think that they are, \u201CYou should always take care, in the\
  \ hills, when occupying a vacant bivouac\u201D, and he/she uses some complex words,\
  \ \u201Csuch ogres are averse to a din\u201D, this adds to the feel of the character.\
  \ The only other individual character in the story is the well educated and successful\
  \ but grumpy, Horst Gack. This character is a German film director who the main\
  \ character speaks of very highly, \u201Cpresiding genius of the cinema of Belligerence,\u201D\
  \ but at the same time the main character seems slightly surprised and shocked at\
  \ the attitude of this film director \u201Cgiven his grim demeanour\u201D.\nExtension\n\
  At the film festival in \xDClm, I saw Horst glide down the steps of his flashy private\
  \ jet; I waved to my acquaintance but through the crowds of paparazzi I was hardly\
  \ visible. I suddenly found myself feeling small and unimportant to anyone, except\
  \ my mother, who to everyone's surprise was fussing over me like a bee collecting\
  \ pollen! Yet on the flight she had truly embarrassed herself in front of the apparent\
  \ \u201Cstrapping young steward\u201D by talking to him about her brand new florist\
  \ shop and the Rose's tournament in the summer, which I had already heard about.\
  \ Still, she seemed not to care, yet the steward looked at me with utter fear that\
  \ he would never escape the rambling on from my mother.\nGravediggers\u2019 Glade\n\
  It is unbelievable, it is not a magical story, it is not a religious story but it\
  \ is almost historical and very repetitive. I say almost historical because it would\
  \ not really happen. If the gravediggers came form far away every night then that\
  \ would be pointless, they'd have no time for their families or tending to their\
  \ donkeys so that the donkeys would be ready for the next days work. It, also, is\
  \ almost historical because it is not a historical story like \u201CThe life of\
  \ the Tudors\u201D but it shows what gravediggers used to do after work, yeah right!\
  \ The historical side of it is that the writer says \u201Cthere used to be\u201D\
  \ (a gravediggers\u2019 glade). It is in the past tense. It is very well written\
  \ in the sense that it uses tremendous vocabulary. Mr Key says words like trudge\
  \ instead of walk or venture or journey and pannier instead of fixed baskets or\
  \ boxes and wending where I would use winding or long and twisting.\nThe characters\
  \ are all gravediggers, hence the name of the piece of writing. Line 7 suggests\
  \ that some of the diggers, coming from far away, are almost \u201CChristlike\u201D\
  . Donkeys are mentioned, a very little amount. It mentions Christ a lot on the first\
  \ page, only in reference. The story also mentions Thomas Hardy, it says \u201C\
  Thomas Hardy wrote about such things\u201D, referring to the sentence before that\
  \ which was talking about \u201Cpeasants lolling about and tilling their crops and\
  \ patches\u201D.\nIt is very much detailed and structured. For example he does not\
  \ just say that they lean their spades against the trees, he says \u201Cleaning\
  \ their spades against the larches, laburnums and sycamores\u201D. He uses specification\
  \ and says the names instead of colours or relating objects. The feel is almost\
  \ boring because I don't care about a gravediggers meeting place from many years\
  \ ago. Nothing exciting happens in it. It is simply an explanation of a journey\
  \ that is not likely to ever happen.\nPotter's Arch or Potter's Crank?\nThis story\
  \ is about the arch of a bridge. Under this bridge is the only way to get down to\
  \ the train station and it is the tobogganist's favourite hill. The title is very\
  \ obscure and misleading \u201CPeople walk down the hill but if you crash into the\
  \ pillar of the arch, you will never be found.\u201D This is what the story is about\
  \ and is repetitive but serious.\nThe station officers are very strange characters\
  \ and are mysterious. The reader doesn't get very much detail about them. They seen\
  \ very accounted to their job, and don't worry about anyone else who might have\
  \ nearly made it to the train station but they crashed into the arch, and even when\
  \ you are expected to be at the train station, they wont come looking for you. This\
  \ is odd because we generally we think that we should help other people in need.\
  \ You know nothing about the tobogganist, except they toboggan\nImitation\nWhen\
  \ the passengers do get down the hill, they usually find out that the train is delayed\
  \ and they will have to wait, in the poor company of the officials in the hut if\
  \ your lucky, but outside if your not. This treatment is expected everywhere on\
  \ the north line track.\n[2010-12-14]"
