text: "One of the tragedies of our Age of Pap is that some of the greatest entertainers\
  \ of the past have been largely forgotten and consigned to oblivion. And none more\
  \ so than the titans of our seaside past, those who used to dazzle and delight teeming\
  \ thousands of holidaymakers. The piers where once they trod the boards are themselves\
  \ now mostly in ruins, if not vanished utterly. Yet once the roaring of the sea\
  \ was drowned out by the roaring and cheering and laughter of the crowds gathered\
  \ to see entertainments the like of which we shall surely never witness again. Now,\
  \ all we have left are brittle, yellowing newspaper cuttings, such as this one,\
  \ clipped from The Pointy Town Bucket & Spade, dated 18 November 1913.\nYour correspondent\
  \ trudged to the end of the Pointy Pier in Pointy Town for an out of season variety\
  \ show. In spite of the torrential rain and bitter winds and the pervading stench\
  \ of bilgewater and rotting fish, dozens of doughty holidaymakers packed out the\
  \ Miss Blossom Partridge Memorial Variety Theatre for an afternoon of tiptop entertainment.\n\
  Top of the bill were those stars of the Pointy Pier, Mr Peevish And His Lovely Wife\
  \ Gwendolyn. They did not disappoint. Mr Peevish was peevish and his lovely wife\
  \ Gwendolyn was lovely. The \u201Cbusiness\u201D with the darned sock, the table-napkin,\
  \ the funnel, and the screeching pipistrelle bat brought the house down. I myself\
  \ was in floods of tears when lovely Gwendolyn sang the sentimental ballad \u201C\
  Oh bring me your winding-sheet, mother of mine\u201D, for the performance of which\
  \ she was wrapped in her mother's actual winding-sheet, still bearing the bloodstains\
  \ coughed up by that good woman in her extremity. That Mr Peevish remained thoroughly\
  \ peevish during his lovely wife's rendition is proof indeed of his consummate peevishness.\n\
  The evening ended with a magic trick, or at least what I took to be a magic trick.\
  \ Several members of the audience were of a differing view, and believed that Mr\
  \ Peevish And His Lovely Wife Gwendolyn had indeed produced, in material form, emerging\
  \ from a puff of smoke, the Great Beast itself, as described in the Book of Revelation.\
  \ The police constable on duty was trampled underfoot as the audience fled in fear\
  \ for their lives.\nLater that evening I noticed that the streets in the immediate\
  \ vicinity of Pointy Pier were covered in some kind of vile noisome sludge. Small\
  \ fires were burning, and every sprig of vegetation was blackened and charred and\
  \ dead, along with a goodly number of puppies and kittens which had unwisely strayed\
  \ from the comforts of hearth and home.\n[2014-11-18]"
