text: "Conducting my regular Hooting Yard Prose Audit, I was dumbstruck to discover\
  \ that only once have I written about fubbed pannicles, and that was five years\
  \ ago. In lieu of anything new to say about this most important of topics, here\
  \ is a timely repost.\nIn an appreciative review of the second, expanded edition\
  \ of Harmonium (1931), R P Blackmur remarked that \u201Cthe most striking if not\
  \ the most important thing\u201D about Stevens's verse was its vocabulary, a heady\
  \ confect including such rarities as \u201Cfubbed\u201D, \u201Cgirandoles\u201D\
  , \u201Cdiaphanes\u201D, \u201Cpannicles\u201D, \u201Ccarked\u201D, \u201Cructive\u201D\
  , \u201Ccantilene\u201D, \u201Cfiscs\u201D, and \u201Cprincox\u201D.\nFrom Wallace\
  \ Stevens\_: Metaphysical Claims Adjuster by Roger Kimball, collected in Experiments\
  \ Against Reality (2000)\nIt was a dark and stormy night. Off the Kentish Knock,\
  \ on the wild and churning waters, the HMS Whither Art? was being tossed about like\
  \ so much flotsam. The ship's captain, Captain Plunkett, was all too aware that\
  \ it was here off the Kentish Knock on a similarly dark and stormy night in 1875\
  \ that the SS Deutschland had been wrecked, and five Franciscan nuns, including\
  \ a peculiarly tall one, had suffered death by drowning. Captain Plunkett had no\
  \ Franciscan nuns aboard his ship, unless there were stowaways of whose presence\
  \ he was ignorant, but well he knew the HMS Whither Art? was in equal danger of\
  \ wreckage on so dark and stormy a night. It would take all his mastery of the nautical\
  \ arts to bring the ship and its crew safely through to dawn, and port.\nClinging\
  \ to the wheel, he cried out for the first mate, First Mate Hoon. Weedy and neurasthenic\
  \ yet impossibly valiant, Hoon came staggering on to the bridge. He was sopping\
  \ wet, drenched by both the teeming rain and by sloshing seawater.\n\u201CHoon!\u201D\
  \ yelled the captain over the howling gale, \u201CIt has suddenly occurred to me\
  \ that we may have stowaways aboard of whom I am ignorant, nuns, Franciscan nuns,\
  \ hiding in the pannicles! Detail a detail of deckhands to search every last inch!\u201D\
  \n\u201CAye aye, captain!\u201D yelled Hoon, \u201CBut I've just had a report over\
  \ the ructive hooter from the princox that the pannicles are fubbed!\u201D\nCaptain\
  \ Plunkett took one hand off the wheel, curled it into a sort of perch, turned it\
  \ towards his head, and bent forward, resting his mouth and chin on his hand, striking\
  \ an attitude almost identical to Rodin's Thinker. He was thinking. He was thinking\
  \ how it could have happened, on his watch, that the pannicles had been fubbed.\
  \ He was thinking how it had come about that he had not heard the princox's message\
  \ over the ructive hooter. He was thinking that he had completely forgotten the\
  \ name of the princox. And he was thinking that, if there were any stowaway Franciscan\
  \ nuns hiding in the pannicles of the HMS Whither Art?, then they would surely have\
  \ been carked by the fubbing. When he had finished thinking, he lifted his head,\
  \ put his hand back to the wheel, and cried aloud again to Hoon.\n\u201CHoon! Scrub\
  \ that last command to detail a detail of deckhands!\u201D\n\u201CAye aye, captain!\
  \ I have obliterated it from my brain so rapidly and thoroughly that already I have\
  \ forgotten to what the word \u2018it\u2019 refers!\u201D\nThe wind continued to\
  \ howl and rage, the rain to teem, the sea to slosh, and the storm to toss the ship\
  \ upon the waters.\n\u201CHoon!\u201D cried the captain, \u201CWhat is the princox's\
  \ name?\u201D\n\u201CI know him only as Alan,\u201D shouted the first mate, \u201C\
  As in Ladd or Whicker or Freeman, known as Fluff.\u201D\n\u201CThe princox is called\
  \ Fluff?\u201D cried Captain Plunkett.\n\u201CAye, captain, by those of the crew\
  \ who are radio enthusiasts.\u201D\n\u201CDetail Fluff to man the diaphanes, Hoon!\u201D\
  \n\u201CAye aye, captain!\u201D.\nAnd Hoon left the bridge, staggering below decks\
  \ in search of the princox. The storm did not abate. The captain struggled manfully\
  \ with the wheel. His head was now empty of thought. He was engaged in an elemental\
  \ battle, man versus sea, or man versus storm, or better, perhaps, man versus stormy\
  \ sea.\nMeanwhile, on one of the decks, poop or orlop, one of the girandoles had\
  \ been torn loose from its cantilene and was clattering about perilously. First\
  \ Mate Hoon, making his slow unsteady way to the princox's nest, saw what had happened\
  \ and realised he had to make an instant decision. There was no time to think. He\
  \ could not afford to curl one hand into a sort of perch, turn it towards his head,\
  \ and bend forward, resting his mouth and chin on his hand, striking an attitude\
  \ almost identical to Rodin's Thinker. He staggered back to the bridge.\n\u201C\
  Captain Plunkett!\u201D he screamed, \u201COne of the girandoles has been torn loose\
  \ from its cantilene and is clattering about perilously on the poop or orlop deck!\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhere is Fluff the princox?\u201D cried the captain.\n\u201CStill in his\
  \ nest I expect,\u201D yelled Hoon, \u201CFor when I saw that one of the girandoles\
  \ had been torn loose from its cantilene and was clattering about perilously on\
  \ the poop or orlop deck, I made an instant decision to tell you about it as soon\
  \ as I possibly could!\u201D\n\u201CYou should have used the ructive hooter!\u201D\
  \ cried Captain Plunkett.\n\u201CBelieve me, captain, I would have done had you\
  \ heard the ructive hooter message regarding the fubbed pannicles. But you did not,\
  \ and I dared not risk that a second ructive hooter message would go unheard by\
  \ you!\u201D\n\u201CThat shows good seamanship, Hoon,\u201D cried the captain, \u201C\
  Let me pin a golden star to your cap.\u201D\n\u201CThank you, captain. I appreciate\
  \ such recognition, it compensates for the lack of pay and the worm-riddled biscuits.\u201D\
  \nAnd all of a sudden there was a lull in the storm, and the captain and the first\
  \ mate looked up at the stars in the sky. For a few precious moments, the HMS Whither\
  \ Art? was safe upon the sea. And down below in the pannicles, the sudden calm prompted\
  \ five stowaway Franciscan nuns of whose presence Captain Plunkett was ignorant,\
  \ one peculiarly tall, to pop their heads out from the rickety fiscs wherein they\
  \ were hiding, and to sing a hymn of thanks to Almighty God, that He had delivered\
  \ them from the fubbing.\n[2017-11-15]"
