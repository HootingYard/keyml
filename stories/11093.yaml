text: "As somebody who refuses to carry a mobile phone, I found myself nodding in\
  \ agreement with this passage from Simon Raven's memoir Boys Will Be Boys. He was\
  \ writing half a century ago, in 1963, about what we now call old-fashioned \u201C\
  landlines\u201D, but how right\u2014and prescient\u2014he was:\nCheap and easy systems\
  \ of communication simply promote cheapness in what is communicated. If people have\
  \ to pay 5/- for a telegram or take the trouble to write and post a letter, they\
  \ think twice before they bother you at all. If they have a telephone, however,\
  \ even the most trivial information takes on urgency. The telephone dispenses irrelevance\
  \ like a tap which won't turn off; it is also a dangerous instrument of interference\
  \ and even persecution; but like most other so-called amenities of modern life,\
  \ the telephone is essential for dealing with complexities which the telephone itself\
  \ has caused, and it is quick to assert its tyranny at the expense of those who,\
  \ like myself, would ignore it.\n[2013-02-28]"
