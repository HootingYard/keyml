text: "Life belts An excellent and cheap life belt, for persons proceeding to sea,\
  \ bathing in dangerous places, or learning to swim, may be thus made: take a yard\
  \ and three-quarters of strong jean, double, and divide into nine compartments.\
  \ Let there be a space of two inches after each third compartment. Fill the compartments\
  \ with very fine cuttings of cork, which may be made by cutting up old corks, or\
  \ (better still) purchased at the corkcutters\u2019. Work eyelet holes at the bottom\
  \ of each compartment, to let the water drain out. Attach a neckband and waist strings\
  \ of stout bootweb and sew them on strongly.\nInvaluable advice from Grandmother's\
  \ Household Hints, As Good Today As Yesterday by Helen Lyon Adamson (1963). I bought\
  \ this yesterday in a charity shop, and find myself ready not only to make my own\
  \ life belt but to remove sweat-stains from hatbands, use hay in my kitchen, deal\
  \ quickly and effectively with fainting, hysterics, apparent death from drunkenness,\
  \ and nails growing into the flesh, make baked custard cabbage and stewed watercress,\
  \ understand the significance of clouds, inflict sure death on insect pests, and\
  \ iron bobbinet laces.\n[2011-08-07]"
