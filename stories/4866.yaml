text: "Here is another project to keep the tinies occupied during the summer holidays.\n\
  Get your pippy bag, and cram it full of kapok. Using a length of butcher's string,\
  \ or an old bootlace, tie the pippy bag tightly closed so that none of the kapok\
  \ will fall out. Now stick innumerable pins into it, and voila! you have a splendid\
  \ homemade pin cushion.\nIt may be that your interests do not run to needlework\
  \ or embroidery, in which case you will not find much use for a pin cushion. So\
  \ let me show you how easy it is to turn it into something far more exciting!\n\
  Fashion a few pipe cleaners into the basic shape of a human body\u2014arms and legs\
  \ and torso. Then poke this into your pin cushion, which serves as the head. Depending\
  \ on the size of your pippy bag, the proportions will be all wrong, and it will\
  \ look a bit like a three-dimensional stick person with a huge bloated hydrocephalic\
  \ head, but don't worry about that. Think of it as a voodoo dolly.\nThe next thing\
  \ you need to do is to force your mind into believing that the dolly is genuinely\
  \ imbued with the spirit of a real person, just as Francis Galton convinced himself\
  \ that Mr Punch was a god. Bear in mind that the dolly has innumerable pins stuck\
  \ in its head, which almost guarantees that the person you choose, whether it is\
  \ David Blunkett, for example, or Gore Vidal, will shortly afterwards have their\
  \ actual head attacked by a swarm of bees.\n[2010-07-28]"
