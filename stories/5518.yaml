text: "\nIn 1922, Charles Ives self-published his collection of 114 songs. Now, almost\
  \ one hundred years later, Mr Key has self-published a collection of 114 stories.\
  \ Yes, at last, wrenched from the innermost core of his creative innards, Impugned\
  \ By A Peasant & Other Stories is available for you to buy, to fawn over, to stroke\
  \ tenderly with your fingertips just like Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa in The\
  \ Royal Hunt Of The Sun, in dazzling sunlight, strokes the Holy Bible. Or you may\
  \ prefer to keep your copy locked away in a lead-lined cabinet, submerged in a pit,\
  \ cordoned off by an electric fence patrolled by wolves and hogs. It's up to you,\
  \ really. The important thing is that you buy as many copies of the book as a sensible\
  \ person would, what with Christmas coming up, and all those birthdays and anniversaries\
  \ and saints\u2019 feast days on which you will want to present your nearest and\
  \ dearest with a treasurable gift. So get with the programme, readers, and hike\
  \ over to Lulu at once to make your purchase!\n[2010-11-03]"
