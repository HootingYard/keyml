  \ as ever, live, had to be abandoned after ten minutes. I am sorry to say I felt\
  \ queasy and dizzy and faint, and was unable to continue babbling into a microphone.\
  \ I think I explained the situation before my dulcet tones were replaced by Erik\
  \ Satie, but as the one piece I did manage to recite was On A Plague Of Boils it\
  \ occurred to me that some listeners may have been given to understand that I had\
  \ to truncate the show because I had broken out in a plague of suppurating boils.\
  \ I am happy to reassure you that this is not the case. As it was, though I did\
  \ not faint, I felt very close to doing so, and still today do not feel tiptop.\
  \ I am bolting clementines as an aid to recovery. Meanwhile, rather than writing\
  \ about Fainting Mr Key, here is a 2008 piece about a fainting goat.\nYou would\
  \ do well to remember, if ever you are out walking in the vicinity of the farmyard\
  \ at Scroonhoonpooge, that you may come face to face with the fainting goat. If\
  \ you encounter it on the lane leading out of the farmyard towards the orchard,\
  \ and as soon as it sees you it topples over in a swoon, you must not be alarmed.\
  \ You must certainly not think that the goat has fainted because you have caused\
  \ it fright, by dint of something alarming in your appearance. Even if there is\
  \ something terrifying about you, such as a twisted-up face or a too-brightly coloured\
  \ clinker jacket or your being armed with a mail order Mannlicher-Carcano sniper's\
  \ rifle, none of these things will be what causes the goat to faint. The goat will\
  \ faint for the reason it is known as the fainting goat, which is that it is constantly\
  \ fainting, dozens of times a day, even dozens of times an hour.\nThis constant\
  \ swooning is a mystery as far as the local vets are concerned. There are several\
  \ vets with practices in walking or short bus journey distance of Scroonhoonpooge\
  \ farmyard, and all of them at one time or another have been called to tend to the\
  \ fainting goat. They have tried all sorts of treatments, from goat-friendly smelling\
  \ salts to the deployment of Peruvian whistling vessels to simply shouting very\
  \ loudly into the goat's ear, and though such techniques may revive the goat from\
  \ its faint, none have served to stop it clattering over in a dead swoon again and\
  \ again as the long countryside day draws on towards dusk and rainfall. When it\
  \ is conscious, the goat seems hale and hearty, even frisky, and engages in all\
  \ the normal activities one might expect of a farmyard goat. I would list these\
  \ activities but I am sure you are thoroughly up to speed with the doings of goats,\
  \ given the demographic of the Hooting Yard readership.\nThere has been a certain\
  \ amount of bickering among the local vets, as each of them grows frustrated at\
  \ their inability to stop the continual fainting of the fainting goat. When they\
  \ passed out of their veterinary colleges, they were all brimming with confidence,\
  \ armed, as they thought, with the knowledge and expertise to handle all sorts of\
  \ bestial maladies, from the workaday to the exotic. Whether it be a cow with a\
  \ pox or an ostrich beset by Von Straubenzee's Gruesomeness, these vets believed\
  \ they could march into a farmyard or menagerie and win the undying gratitude of\
  \ farmers and menagerists by weaving their vetty spells. An injection here, a siphoning\
  \ off of fluid there, and to the gasps of their keepers the cow or ostrich or whatever\
  \ beast it may be would leap up, restored to vigour, and there would be a round\
  \ of applause and the discreet passing of banknotes into the pocket of the smug\
  \ vet.\nBut the fainting goat goes on fainting, day in day out, and not one of the\
  \ vets has a clue what to do about it. When they gather of an evening on the balcony\
  \ of the Caf\xE9 Simon Schama, at first they boast of their breakthroughs, the splint\
  \ affixed to the leg of the sparrow, the gunk drained from the badger's boils, the\
  \ palsied pig unpalsied. But as they sip their fermented slops, tempers fray, and\
  \ the talk soon turns to the fainting goat, that damned intractable fainting goat,\
  \ and harsh words are said and there is spitting and chucking and fisticuffs, black\
  \ eyes and bruises and the odd dagger slash. And so it goes on, night after night.\n\
  Now curiously enough, during the night the fainting goat never faints. It remains\
  \ wide awake all night every night, either in its comfy pen or out in some field,\
  \ doing goaty things, things other goats do in daylight. Apprised of this singular\
  \ information, some have posited that the goat's swoons are not swoons so much as\
  \ its repeatedly falling asleep from exhaustion. It is indeed a cogent case, but\
  \ it is nevertheless mistaken, for reasons crystal clear to those, such as some\
  \ among the vets, who have made studies of the goat's neurological peculiarities.\
  \ It sleeps not, yet it faints. The one is understood, and explicable, the other\
  \ not. There are more curious cases among the goat population, as among other farmyard\
  \ beasts, but not many, sure enough. That is why the vets fret so.\nBut you will\
  \ not fret, will you, as you wander past Scroonhoonpooge farmyard, on your way to\
  \ the orchard, to pluck persimmons from the trees, illegally, and you come upon\
  \ the fainting goat upon the path and it faints at your feet? You will pat its little\
  \ horns and lift it to its feet, and send it tottering off along the lane to its\
  \ next collapse, for you are wiser than the vets, you are wiser than the farmer.\
  \ The only thing wiser than you is the fainting goat itself. No goat was ever wiser,\
  \ nor had so explosive a brain.\n[2012-06-01]"
