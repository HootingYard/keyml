text: "In Victoria Of England (1936), Edith Sitwell tells us\nthe Queen's sympathies\
  \ were aroused when, towards the end of August 1892, Mr Gladstone had a miraculous\
  \ escape from the sinister attentions of a cow. It appears from a letter written\
  \ to the Queen by Mrs Gladstone that this highly reprehensible animal rushed at\
  \ Mr Gladstone and threw him upon his back, after which she stood over him, glaring\
  \ in a most threatening manner. Mr Gladstone glared back, and some moments had been\
  \ spent in this mutual pursuit before the statesman, who, according to his wife,\
  \ had never lost his presence of mind for a moment, was able to rise to his feet\
  \ and dart behind a tree\u2014whereupon the cow forgot him immediately and strolled\
  \ away. The cow was shot.\nIn this respect, if no other, David Blunkett is the Gladstone\
  \ de nos jours.\n[2013-09-07]"
