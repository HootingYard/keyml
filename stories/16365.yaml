text: "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed\
  \ in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his back, and as he lifted\
  \ his head slightly, he could see several tiny, stick-thin legs wriggling helplessly.\
  \ He realised that, at some point during the night, he had become some kind of beetle.\
  \ His brain could not cope with this horror, and promptly shut down, propelling\
  \ him back into merciful unconsciousness.\nWhen, eventually, he woke from his stupor,\
  \ he was shocked to discover that he had undergone a second transformation. He was\
  \ no longer a beetle. He was a Beatle! Somehow, he had now become Ringo Starr, or,\
  \ more precisely, a perfect replica of Ringo Starr circa 1964. Cautiously, he ran\
  \ his hands over his hair, now become a moptop. He called out, quietly, for his\
  \ Mama, and heard a lugubrious Liverpudlian accent. But Mama did not come, and in\
  \ his despair he picked up a pair of drumsticks which had appeared on his bedside\
  \ table, and bashed himself on the head, repeatedly and rhythmically, with a characteristic\
  \ \u201Cfill\u201D, until, once again, he lost consciousness.\nThere were more uneasy\
  \ dreams, and when he awoke again he discovered he had undergone a third transformation.\
  \ Now he had become an entirely new being. Outwardly\u2014indeed, inwardly\u2014\
  he was exactly the same as he had been the previous day, no longer a beetle or a\
  \ Beatle. Yet it was clear to him, as he leapt out of bed and plunged his head into\
  \ a bucket of icy water and shuffled into the kitchen for a breakfast of jugged\
  \ eels and reconstituted marmalade and turned on the radiogram to listen to an early\
  \ morning concert of argumentative German improvised racket, that something had\
  \ changed, something decisive and irreversible. But what?\nNeither Mama nor Papa,\
  \ nor his young sister Sophonisba, gave any indication that he was in any way different.\
  \ But then they barely noticed his presence at all, as they sat at the kitchen table\
  \ stuffing their gobs with cornflakes and hardboiled eggs in jelly. So concentrated\
  \ were they on their munching and chewing they did not even hear the frankly godawful\
  \ din from the radiogram.\nHe decided that the simplest way to work out what had\
  \ happened to him would be to go about his usual routine, but to monitor himself.\
  \ So he spent a profitable three or four hours faffing about with the inner workings\
  \ of his wristwatch. When he was done, it would not only tell the time, but it would\
  \ keep a continuous check on the state of his soul and his vitals. If all his tweakings\
  \ were correct, then at nightfall, when the day was done, his watch would spit out\
  \ a printed report, with handy bullet points. The next day, he could pass this to\
  \ a consultant for analysis.\nThe difficulty would be to find a competent analyst.\
  \ He did not require the services of a brain-quack, but of someone learned in such\
  \ fields as ornithology, geology, origami, athletics, trellis work, and rustic wisdom.\
  \ If necessary, he would have to consult separate experts and then correlate their\
  \ findings. It was going to be an uphill struggle.\nFortunately, Gregor Samsa was\
  \ no stranger to uphill struggles, for the chalet where he lived with his Mama and\
  \ Papa and sister Sophonisba was at the foot of an important mountain. Every day\
  \ he had to clamber across scree and up treacherous snow-covered slopes to get to\
  \ the newsagent's. That was the first part of his routine. He purchased a copy of\
  \ The Daily Voodoo Dolly and a pint of warm untreated goaty milk sloppings, and\
  \ then he climbed ever further up the mountainside, panting, until he reached his\
  \ other chalet. He had always thought it best to have two chalets, one in which\
  \ to sleep and ablute and eat breakfast, and another as a bolt-hole away from his\
  \ family, in which he could while away the day staring out of the window at snow\
  \ and sky and the various types of birds which flit and swoop in that sky.\nBut\
  \ on this day he was only part of the way across the scree when his head became\
  \ filled with uncertainty and doubt. His legs were like jelly. On impulse, he turned\
  \ back, back to the family chalet, and he unlatched the door and slammed it shut\
  \ behind him and collapsed on the carpet, across which he could see a beetle scurry.\
  \ An insect, that is, not Ringo.\nHe lay on the floor wondering if the newsagent\
  \ would be alarmed by his unaccustomed absence, and by the unsold copy of The Daily\
  \ Voodoo Dolly. Would the newsagent call the helicopter police? Would they come\
  \ in search of him, swooping across the sky, just like the birds? Unlike the birds,\
  \ would they come scrambling down on rope ladders and kick in the chalet windows\
  \ and Taser him and hoist him up into their chopper and ferry him across the important\
  \ mountains to a sinister compound? Would he be dragged to a cellar and tied to\
  \ a chair and interrogated under Klieg lights? Would they mistake him for Ringo\
  \ Starr? Would he be forced to sing Octopus's Garden, or would they demand that\
  \ he tell them tales of Thomas The Tank Engine? All these, and other panicky questions\
  \ throbbed in his brainpans until he remembered that he was not Ringo, he was neither\
  \ a Beatle nor a beetle. But what in the name of Saint Spivack had he become? He\
  \ got up from the carpet and went to his cupboard and took out a hammer and nails\
  \ and planks and barricaded himself into the chalet. Mama and Papa and Sophonisba\
  \ were out, attending an all-day archery tournament in a nearby village.\nHis barricading\
  \ had blotted out the daylight, so he deployed an array of blubber candles here\
  \ and there, on sideboards and mantelpieces and tabletops and counters. He gazed\
  \ at the flames, one by one, and pondered how curious it was that this light was\
  \ produced by what was once the innards of that mighty sea beast, the whale. He\
  \ asked himself if his own innards might, in some future dispensation, shed light\
  \ upon the world. Was that to be his destiny, as a new kind of being, in his transformed\
  \ state?\nHours passed, with no hint of police helicopters, and one by one the blubber\
  \ candles sputtered and guttered out, and he was left in darkness. Rather than shedding\
  \ light, then, was his fate to become some kind of nocturnal being, like an owl\
  \ or a bat?\nHe rummaged through the nooks of memory to try to recall what he had\
  \ learned of the bat and the owl through years upon years of study. He remembered\
  \ little, save for sounds of squeak and hoot and that both bat and owl have the\
  \ gift of flight. Could he now, in his transformation, fly? He flapped his arms,\
  \ testing the air, and discovered that, yes!, he could indeed fly. He rose so fast\
  \ that he crashed right through the skylight in the chalet ceiling. Now he was up\
  \ in the cold moonlit air, wheeling and swooping, a human starling.\nNow it so happened\
  \ that down below, on the path from the village, his parents and his sister were\
  \ returning from the archery tournament. Looking up at the moon, they were startled\
  \ to see so strange an airborne being.\n\u201CLet us fell that highly unusual flying\
  \ creature,\u201D said Mama, \u201CWe can sell the corpse to a museum and make a\
  \ tidy sum. We will be able to pay for Gregor to be put in a Mercy Home for the\
  \ Feckless & Bewildered.\u201D\nAnd the three of them each took their bows and arrows\
  \ and shot him out of the sky. He plummeted to earth at their feet, thrice pierced\
  \ and stone dead, and they saw that it was Gregor.\n\u201CCrikey!\u201D said Mama,\
  \ \u201CWe've bollocksed things up good and proper. As soon as the helicopter police\
  \ find out what we've done we'll be in hot water and no mistake. There's only one\
  \ thing for it. We'll have to flee, all three of us. If we turn around now and go\
  \ back to the village, we should be just in time to catch the night train to that\
  \ dilapidated seaside resort a hundred miles away. There is an unseemly hotel there,\
  \ where we can hole up until this kerfuffle blows over, or for the rest of our lives,\
  \ depending on the pertinacity of the coppers. Let's go!\u201D\nThey made it to\
  \ the railway station with seconds to spare, first dumping their bows and arrows\
  \ in a skip next to the signal box. As the night train chugged out towards the seaside,\
  \ they sat in their carriage, stuffing their gobs with a supper of lemon meringue\
  \ pie \u2018n\u2019 boiled liver. And it was like a confirmation of their new dreams\
  \ and excellent intentions that at the end of their journey their daughter sprang\
  \ to her feet first and stretched her young body.\nMuch, but not all, of this piece\
  \ is recycled, with tweaks, from On My Transformation, which appeared here in March\
  \ 2012. The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Willa\
  \ and Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-03-18]"
