text: "\nThe noted mezzotintist Dot Tint was born in the Year Dot. Some researchers\
  \ argue that she was named for the year in which she was born, while others, conversely,\
  \ claim the year was so named in honour of her. On the face ot it, the latter seems\
  \ unlikely. Noted Dot Tint may be, but do enough people care enough about mezzotints\
  \ or their makers to start naming entire years after them? But those who take this\
  \ side of the argument are indefatigable, relentless, and occasionally physically\
  \ violent when propounding their case.\nAnd admittedly, they have a number of points\
  \ in their favour. No one knows what the Year Dot was called before it was designated\
  \ the Year Dot. They are also able to point to the Year Kuryakin, which all authorities\
  \ agree was named after Ilya Kuryakin, the Russian agent in the television seiies\
  \ The Man From U.N.C.L.E. played by the Scottish-American actor David McCallum.\
  \ Poignantly, there is not, and never has been, a Year McCallum. Thus, the calendar\
  \ recognises his fictional persona rather than the man himself.\nA question well\
  \ worth asking, whichever side of the Dot Tint fence you are on, is\_: what kind\
  \ of blather is this?\n[2018-03-21]"
