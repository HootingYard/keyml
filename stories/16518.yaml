text: 'Sick at heart and improperly trousered, the vicar galumphed across the fields
  towards the viaduct. Not for nothing was he known as the vicar of the viaduct. Air
  wafted about his head, tiny little flying insects perched ephemerally in his hair.
  He had his sermon all prepared, committed to memory, for the service of the blessing
  of the crutches. The sun blazed down. Brave Helios!
