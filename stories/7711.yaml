text: 'There are many ways of arranging a water-party at yachting stations and at
  all riverside places. At yachting stations, for instance, a sailing yacht is hired
  to convey a party of from eighteen to twenty-five to some point of interest on the
  coast, in which case luncheon and tea are provided at an hotel in the vicinity of
  the place where the party have landed, and the expenses are equally divided. Not
  unfrequently, on the return journey, the yacht is becalmed, and does not reach its
  destination until between two and three the following morning. If it happens to
  be a fine moonlight night, this prolongation of a water-party is an additional source
  of enjoyment; but if there is no moon as well as no wind, and the calm betokens
  a storm, it is the reverse of pleasant. But these little contretemps, when they
  do occur, rather lend a zest to the day''s pleasure, and are something to talk about
  afterwards.
