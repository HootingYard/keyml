text: "Dear Mr Key\n  Down the pub the other night\u2014the Cow & Pins, if you want\
  \ to know\u2014me and my mates fell to discussing Hooting Yard. Though we broadly\
  \ approve of your work, we all agreed that, going forward, you need to be more diverse\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 vibrant, in keeping with the diversity \u2018n\u2019 vibrancy everybody\
  \ keeps going on about these days. So what are you going to do about it, chummy?\n\
  \  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Thank you for your measured letter. You may not have\
  \ bothered to measure it before sending, but I took a tape measure to it as soon\
  \ as I opened the envelope. It pains me to say it, but I suspect you are correct\
  \ about the need to be more diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant. This is partly out of\
  \ self-interest, as I am sure that if I could prove my diversity \u2018n\u2019 vibrancy\
  \ I might become eligible for lots of grants from the kinds of organisations that\
  \ hand out grants to diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant initiatives. Then I would be\
  \ rolling in cash and could put my feet up while the diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant\
  \ elves got on with all the hard work and drudgery that makes Hooting Yard such\
  \ a well-loved community resource. I am stymied, however, by not knowing quite how\
  \ to become diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant. Perhaps you and your mates could give\
  \ me some tips?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  We had a good old natter about your\
  \ letter down at the Cow & Pins last night. We all agreed that elves were a good\
  \ start if you intend to be more diverse going forward. A diverse intake of elves\
  \ would be even better, so try to recruit different types. Somewhere there is a\
  \ list of goblin types, and I'm sure you could adapt this for elves. Well done,\
  \ and keep up the good work!\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  I think you have misunderstood,\
  \ perhaps wilfully, my earlier letter. I cannot afford to recruit a single elf until\
  \ I get one of those lavish grants awarded to diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant community\
  \ initiatives, but I can't get a lavish grant until I prove how diverse \u2018n\u2019\
  \ vibrant I am. What a dilemma! Please resolve it.\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n \
  \ I feel your pain, I really do. We all do, sat here in the snug of the Cow & Pins\
  \ downing our pints. We had a long and detailed discussion about your case, and\
  \ came to the view that you might be able to get a grant if you were vibrant. Then\
  \ you could pay for some elves, and hey presto!, you'd be diverse too! Everybody\
  \ wins.\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Many thanks for your considered advice. I\
  \ would act on it immediately if I had the merest clue of what \u2018vibrancy\u2019\
  \ consists, precisely. The word is bandied about willy-nilly, but I confess I have\
  \ never understood what on earth it means. Please explain.\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr\
  \ Key\n  You don't need to know what it means, you just need to get with the programme,\
  \ buster!\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Point taken. How?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr\
  \ Key\n  I hope the following information is of help. Costa Coffee planned to open\
  \ a branch in Totnes, home of the vilified undertakers\u2019 mute. The company has\
  \ now withdrawn from the fray after meeting objections from middle-class people.\
  \ However, while their plans were still active, they issued a press statement saying\
  \ they aimed \u201Cto add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community\
  \ \u2026 by adding vibrancy\u201D. That is clear enough, Mr Key, so what's stopping\
  \ you?\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Now I have received your latest letter, all\
  \ that is stopping me from becoming vibrant is my woeful lack of design skills.\
  \ If I had the wit, I would immediately change the logo at the top of the page to\
  \ read \u201CHooting Yard\_: A Website By Frank Key\_: Now With Added Vibrancy!\u201D\
  \ (I thought the addition of the exclamation mark would be a particularly vibrant\
  \ masterstroke.) If I understand you correctly, I could then apply for a grant,\
  \ on the basis of my vibrancy, then use that money to employ a gaggle of elves,\
  \ if of course \u2018gaggle\u2019 is the correct collective noun for plural elves.\
  \ I would then be both diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant and money would pour in to\
  \ my coffers. Is that right?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  Yes.\n  Tim Thurn\nDear\
  \ Grant-Awarding Body\n  Hooting Yard is a diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant website\
  \ going forward. Can I have a large amount of money please?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr\
  \ Key\n  No you may not. In order to qualify for a grant, you must not only be diverse\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 vibrant going forward but robust \u2018n\u2019 transparent to boot.\n\
  \  A. Git\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Please see the enclosed letter from A. Git. I have an\
  \ intractable problem, in that I am both puny and opaque. Do you have any suggestions?\n\
  \  Frank Key\nBut answer came there none. . .\n[2012-10-26]"
