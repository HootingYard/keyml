text: 'I bought a new washing machine yesterday. The workman who plumbed it in engaged
  me in a vigorous discussion about the Kennedy assassination. His sole source of
  information seemed to be the preposterous Oliver Stone film. I brandished a copy
  of Case Closed by Gerald Posner at him and tried to convince him that all the conspiracy
  theories are twaddle. I do not think I succeeded. He did a splendid and efficient
  job, and I gave him a tip. I ought to have given him the Posner paperback.
