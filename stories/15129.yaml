text: "Yesterday I mentioned, in passing, Will Self. This is never a good idea. I\
  \ am reminded, however, that I really need to stamp my big black boot down and make\
  \ something very clear. First, back in 2009, we had the question posed \u201CIs\
  \ Frank Key Will Self?\u201D And now, just the other day, this:\n\nWhile I am flattered\
  \ by Mr Bugs\u2019 complimentary remarks, I am equally appalled to find myself compared\
  \ in any way with the preposterous figure of Self. Perhaps the most laughable thing\
  \ is the idea that he is some kind of edgy intellectual maverick. From his many\
  \ appearances in the Grauniad and on the BBC, I think it is clear that he is in\
  \ possession of the Middle-Class Student Wanker's starter pack marked \u2018This\
  \ is what you think\u2019. All his opinions are predictable and orthodox. If there\
  \ is such a thing as the \u201Cmetropolitan liberal elite\u201D, he is a card-carrying\
  \ member. For example, he believes that everyone who voted for Brexit is probably\
  \ a racist. Such simplistic twaddle will always get you applause and whooping from\
  \ a Question Time audience, a fairly reliable indicator of vacuous dimwittery.\n\
  I fear, however, that I will forever be linked with the wretched Self, given that\
  \ his one useful contribution to the world was giving Mr Key a light for his cigarette\
  \ in the midst of a downpour in south London.\n[2017-01-18]"
