text: "The painter Duff Painter was known as \u201Cthe painter of painters\u201D.\
  \ This was not because he was considered the greatest of painters, nor that he was\
  \ held in the highest of esteem by his fellow painters. Rather, he was dubbed \u201C\
  the painter of painters\u201D because of the single-minded intensity of his vision.\
  \ During his long career, Duff Painter confined himself to one subject. All he ever\
  \ painted was painters, that is, the lengths of rope attached to the bows of boats\
  \ for tying them to the quayside, or to bigger ships.\nPainter's paintings of painters\
  \ were done in an incoherent jumble of styles, and he worked fast, often completing\
  \ several paintings of painters in a single day. He might do an impressionistic\
  \ daub in the morning, an expressionistic daub in the afternoon, and a quite frankly\
  \ cack-handed impasto mulch in the evening. When one considers that he lived to\
  \ the age of ninety, and was active up to the very end, it comes as no surprise\
  \ to learn that a complete catalogue raisonn\xE9 of his output has yet to be compiled\u2014\
  though not for want of trying.\nThe art critic Godolphin Weems has spent years devoting\
  \ himself to the project, trying to track down every single Painter painter painting\
  \ in existence, photographing it with a superduper high resolution camera, writing\
  \ a brisk yet captivating thousand word essay on it, and ranking it in order of\
  \ both painterliness and importance. So tireless and unstinting has Weems been that\
  \ today he cuts a sorry figure, sprawled on a municipal park bench in a dilapidated\
  \ seaside resort, swigging turps from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag. Now almost\
  \ ninety himself, Weems is no more than half-way through his mighty task.\nHe has\
  \ not yet, for example, managed to locate the astonishing works of Painter's late\
  \ period, where he took to daubing paint directly on to painters. Many of these\
  \ so-called \u201Cropey paintings\u201D are probably attached to the bows of boats,\
  \ tied to quaysides or ships, and God alone knows where they are scattered upon\
  \ the waterways of the world.\n\nA hyperrealist painting of a painter by Duff Painter\
