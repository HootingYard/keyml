text: "\u201CBooks on \u2018Hindu feats\u2019 became available throughout the twentieth\
  \ century, explaining such classic Indian wonders as snake charming and \u2018the\
  \ bed of nails\u2019, but also including a wide range of potentially dangerous demonstrations\
  \ that were less obviously Indian. These were the books to read if you were interested\
  \ in \u2018Driving a spike into your head\u2019, \u2018Eating a ball of fire\u2019\

  \ pastimes would do well to read the instructions carefully. \u2018Chewing molten\
  \ lead\u2019, for example, required a special compound that \u2018melts at approximately\
  \ 160 degrees. If you wish a lower melting point, add to the above a small amount\
  \ of quicksilver\u2026 When melted, this mixture may be poured on the tongue which,\
  \ it goes without saying, must be moist with saliva.\u2019 And if the student was\
  \ not convinced by that explanation, the following assurance of the author was given:\
  \ \u2018Personally, I have never developed enough courage to try this, although\
  \ several have told me it is OK.'\u201D\nPeter Lamont, The Rise Of The Indian Rope\
  \ Trick (2004), quoting from Thrilling Magic by Leonard H Miller (1959)\n[2010-05-24]"
