text: "We know the identities of six of the octogamist Medea Blenkinsop's husbands.\
  \ There is the nobleman Blenkinsop himself, his horse trainer, the Emperor of China,\
  \ the postman, the circus giant, and the maniac in the cellar. But what of the remaining\
  \ two? Who were they?\nOver the years, students of this kind of thing have toiled\
  \ fruitlessly. This should not surprise us, as there are only certain kinds of toil\
  \ which bear fruit, and even then, much of the fruit will be rotten and eaten away\
  \ by canker-worms, at least in the orchards I frequent, with my stick and my lantern\
  \ and my bird-scarifier.\nLately, however, evidence has come to light suggesting\
  \ Medea Blenkinsop's seventh husband was none other than the dwarf Crepusco, confidante\
  \ of the composer Binder. How like Medea Blenkinsop to be married to both a giant\
  \ and a dwarf at the same time! This revelation, in a recent issue of the Bulletin\
  \ Of Blenkinsopiana, has already stirred up a vipers\u2019 nest of controversy in\
  \ the field. When I say \u201Cfield\u201D, I am referring to an academic field,\
  \ that of Blenkinsop studies, not the field adjacent to one of the orchards in which\
  \ I skulk, at night, breathing in the heady scent of rotting pears and persimmons.\
  \ I cross the field to reach the orchard gate. There are many cows living in the\
  \ field, it is their home, and though, after the Blunkett incident, the government\
  \ has warned us of cow peril, I know the cows and the cows know me, and we have\
  \ reached an understanding, and let me tell you here and now it is a fine, fine\
  \ thing to have an understanding with cows, a finer thing than all else under the\
  \ boundless firmament.\nMuch of the controversy centres upon the idea that Crepusco\
  \ is being counted twice, in that he is the same husband as the maniac chained in\
  \ the cellar. This is clearly gibberish. Crepusco was no maniac, at least not habitually,\
  \ and it is absurd to suggest that Binder, a Triton among minnows in the world o\u2019\
  \ symphonic composition, would have had to creep down to the subterranean reaches\
  \ of the Blenkinsop country pile every time he sought counsel from his confidante.\
  \ In any case, what kind of composer would have a maniac for a confrere?\u2014apart\
  \ from Harrison Birtwistle, that is.\nNo, I think we may safely assume Crepusco\
  \ was indeed a separate, seventh husband. The case is compelling. We know Medea\
  \ Blenkinsop and Crepusco went a-walking together along perilous clifftop pathways,\
  \ in all weathers, she in her kagoul and he in his amusing knitwear. We know there\
  \ were clinches in grottos. We know they swapped railway timetables, something Medea\
  \ never did with her fourth husband, the suspicious postman. And we know that Crepusco's\
  \ torso was emblazoned with a tattoo, Rococo in design, spelling out the legend\
  \ \u201CGod help me for I am besotted with Medea Blenkinsop and I worship the very\
  \ spittle with which her lips are flecked\u201D.\nIt is, actually, this last point\
  \ that bolsters the otherwise worthless arguments of the anti-Crepuscoists. When,\
  \ they ask, with some justification, were Medea Blenkinsop's lips ever spittle-flecked?\
  \ Not a trace of spittle is ever depicted in any of the hundreds of portraits of\
  \ her, whether they be photographs or paintings or crayon scribbles or pencil drawings\
  \ or primitivist daubings or mezzotints by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint or hyperrealist\
  \ linocuts by the noted hyperrealist linocutter Rex Hyper. It may be that, battered\
  \ by wild gales as they clung to one another upon a stormy clifftop, shouting their\
  \ heads off to be heard above the screeching of auks and gulls and kittiwakes, a\
  \ fleck or two of spittle might have appeared, fugitively, upon Medea Blenkinsop's\
  \ lip, without a Rex Tint there to record it for posterity. We shall never know.\n\
  Nor, it seems, are we likely to know the identity of husband number eight. The author\
  \ of the essay in the Bulletin admits as much, when she writes:\nThe more I have\
  \ studied this kind of thing, the more convinced have I become that Medea Blenkinsop's\
  \ eighth husband was but a phantom, a chimera, an invention of her madcap brain,\
  \ woven from whole cloth, a life-sized rag doll she carted about with her, to the\
  \ opera and to cocktail parties, much as Oskar Kokoschka did with the Alma Mahler\
  \ doll he had made for him at the end of their affair. But I am not one hundred\
  \ per cent sure, even now, even now, oh baby, twenty-four hours from Tulsa.\n\n\
