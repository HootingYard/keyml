text: "So fatuous, Snigsby, preening in his periwig and epaulettes. Fatuous, too,\
  \ his fat friend the king, standing on the pier, beckoning gulls. His royal hand\
  \ is raised, palm upwards, and on the palm a scattering of millet. When the gulls\
  \ swoop, the fatuous fat king will chuckle and call to Snigsby to execute a hurried\
  \ pencil sketch which can later be worked up into a huge oil painting for the king's\
  \ gallery.\nBut no gulls swoop, today, for it is one of those birdless days in the\
  \ kingdom. The sky is empty of birds, as happens on the birdless days, which alas\
  \ the king's prognosticators can never predict with any accuracy. Where the birds\
  \ go, on these days, has not yet been ascertained, though several philosophers are\
  \ hard at work in the king's tower trying to account for the circumstance.\nThe\
  \ philosophers\u2019 previous task was to explain the workings of railway timetables,\
  \ a job they performed so well that the king presented every man jack of them with\
  \ periwigs and epaulettes and special coins to keep in their pockets. They were\
  \ toy coins, not legal tender, but they glistened brightly and pleased the philosophers,\
  \ who were easily pleased by kingly gifts.\nSnigsby was too fatuous to be a philosopher\
  \ or prognosticator and to be frank he was something of a butterfingers with his\
  \ sketching pencil. But so fatuous was the fat king that he thought Snigsby's cack-handed\
  \ scribbles were surpassing in loveliness.\nWhen the king called him, Snigsby scampered\
  \ forwards along the pier, but he tripped and toppled and plunged into the sea.\
  \ Mermaids snatched away his pencil and his sketchpad, his periwig and his epaulettes,\
  \ and poor poor Snigsby, flailing in the water under a birdless sky, was dragged\
  \ below the surface by the mermaids\u2019 pet scavenger fish. They fixed him with\
  \ limpets to a seabed rock, there to perish.\nThe king, who had not noticed Snigsby's\
  \ fall, grew tired of calling, grew tired of holding out his upturned millet-scattered\
  \ palm at the end of the pier on a birdless day. He tossed the millet into the sea\
  \ and turned on his heel and minced back to the promenade where his horse waited\
  \ with the immense patience of a horse. The king mounted his steed and galloped\
  \ along the coast to an ice cream kiosk.\nWould tomorrow be birdless too?\n[2013-11-19]"
