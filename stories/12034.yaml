text: "Flouncing along the insalubrious streets of my bailiwick the other day, I passed\
  \ a shop, the windows of which were plastered with a riot of signage announcing,\
  \ I supposed, the goods and services available within. Among these, the one I took\
  \ particular note of was BUTCHERS\u2019 TRAVEL CARDS.\nIt had never occurred to\
  \ me that butchers required special permits to roam beyond their immediate premises,\
  \ but the more I thought about it the more it seemed a sensible measure. After all,\
  \ there are few experiences more unnerving than boarding a bus and finding that\
  \ the only spare seat is next to a butcher in his bloody apron, waving his bloody\
  \ cleaver. In such circumstances, it would be reassuring to know that the butcher\
  \ had special permission to be aboard the bus, and had not just taken it into his\
  \ head to go riding around on a whim. Freely roving butchers, on the look out for\
  \ a cow or a pig to hew, are a menace.\nHere I am making the assumption, of course,\
  \ that butchers are vetted for soundness of mind and moral probity before their\
  \ travel passes are issued. Otherwise the system falls apart at the seams, much\
  \ in the way the carcass of an ox does when, spotting the living ox in a field from\
  \ the window of the bus, the free roaming butcher forces the driver to halt, uses\
  \ the emergency knob to open the doors, charges across the field towards the ox,\
  \ fells it with a blow from his axe, and then chops it to pieces.\nIt follows, then,\
  \ that the shopkeeper has a duty to check the credentials of a butcher before handing\
  \ over his travel card. Butchers cleared for travel must be in possession of a certificate\
  \ or warrant, signed by a person authorised to allow butchers to travel, and stamped\
  \ with an official mark. The bureaucracy of all this is bewildering but admirable.\n\
  Just as there are rogue butchers who will sneak out of their premises and go a-wandering\
  \ without a pass, it seems likely that there are also rogue shopkeepers who are\
  \ prepared to hand out butchers\u2019 travel cards like confetti, without first\
  \ making the proper checks. I sincerely hope my local shopkeeper is not such a moral\
  \ pygmy, but given the general insalubriousness of my bailiwick, it would not come\
  \ as a surprise.\nIt occurred to me that I could test the shopkeeper by prancing\
  \ into his shop and asking to buy a butchers\u2019 travel card. But by the time\
  \ I was struck by this thought I had passed far beyond the stretch of street where\
  \ stood the shop, and I was reluctant to turn back. I had come to a different string\
  \ of shops, one of which was a butchers\u2019. As I approached it, the door was\
  \ flung open and out came the butcher, in his bloody apron, waving his bloody cleaver,\
  \ roaring and shouting. He had spied a small pig at the trough in the square.\n\
  I was about to intervene, with mad yet civic-minded bravery, when I spotted, slotted\
  \ into the band of his butchers\u2019 hat, in full view, a blue and yellow laminated\
  \ plastic rectangle. It was his butchers\u2019 travel card! I waved him on his way\u2014\
  though in truth he was taking no notice of me\u2014and he fell upon the small pig\
  \ with horrible inhuman cries, dismembering it where it stood.\nIt was only later,\
  \ back at home, that I realised the butcher may have obtained his butchers\u2019\
  \ travel card under false pretences. Legally, he may have been properly confined\
  \ within the walls of his butchers\u2019 shop. I resolved, next time I went flouncing\
  \ about my bailiwick, to call in at the Central Butchers\u2019 Registration Office,\
  \ to report my suspicions. You may think me an interfering busybody, but better\
  \ safe than sorry.\n[2013-10-01]"
