text: "There is a phrase I recall from my childhood, regularly used by my mother when\
  \ I\u2014dippy and dreamy\u2014was getting ready for school in the mornings.\n\u201C\
  One of dese days,\u201D she would say, in her Flemish accent, \u201CYou will go\
  \ out widout your own head.\u201D\nPish!, I thought, That is alarmist talk!\nBut\
  \ then one winter's morning my mother's prediction came true. I set off for school\
  \ in the wind and snow, having left my head snoozing on the pillow. I suspect the\
  \ people I passed in the street must have been astonished at the sight of a boy\
  \ without a head, but I cannot say for sure, because of course I was completely\
  \ unaware of them. My ears and eyes, lodged as they were in my head, were warm and\
  \ snug and still abed.\nSo familiar was I with the route to school, along the lane\
  \ and past the duckpond and the fireworks factory and through the tunnel under the\
  \ motorway and then along the canal towpath and past the aerodrome and the vinegar\
  \ works, that I had no need of my head to get me there. It was only when I sat down\
  \ at my desk in the classroom that things went awry.\nIn those days, you see, we\
  \ were taught such piffle as reading and writing and arithmetic and Latin and history,\
  \ so my not having a head sent the teachers into a kerfuffle. I'm told there was\
  \ some kind of emergency meeting in the staffroom\u2014a fug of pipe-smoke then,\
  \ of course\u2014and I was put in isolation in the sickroom while they worked out\
  \ what to do. How much more enlightened would things be today! Head or no head,\
  \ I am sure there would be no attempt to exclude me from the diversity and self-esteem\
  \ lessons. Indeed, my headless presence would be seen as a benefit, both to myself\
  \ and to my fellow pupils, and to the teachers themselves. In fact, I would probably\
  \ get a prize, just for not having a head. On the rare occasions prizes were dished\
  \ out in those far off days, they were invariably book tokens, and I would certainly\
  \ not have got one for not having a head. Now, I could expect something useful like\
  \ a new app for my iPap, or a voucher for Pizza Kabin.\nBut back then I was kept\
  \ locked in the sickroom, excluded and with my self esteem crushed, all because\
  \ I'd come to school without my head. I would like to say that I sat there reflecting\
  \ ruefully that my mother had been right all along, but any reflection, rueful or\
  \ otherwise, wasn't possible without my head, resting happily on the pillow back\
  \ home.\nWhat happened was that the school called in a local doctor, who made a\
  \ snap diagnosis after looking at me for about three seconds. He didn't even use\
  \ his stethoscope. Puffing on his pipe, he informed the headmaster in a grave doctorly\
  \ voice that I showed all the symptoms of not having a head, and the best treatment\
  \ was brisk exercise in the open air. So they sent me running round and round the\
  \ athletics track all day, until the bell rang at home time. I got a ticking off\
  \ from the gym teacher, to which I was thankfully oblivious, and then I was pointed\
  \ in the direction of the canal towpath and told not to forget my head again or\
  \ there would be ramifications. Yes, they used to use long words like \u201Cramifications\u201D\
  \ even with headless tinies! What a different world it was.\nI trudged home in the\
  \ wind and snow, went up to my bedroom, plopped my head back on to my neck, and\
  \ sat down to warm myself in front of the gas fire. How could it be, I wondered,\
  \ that the school was even open in such inclement weather?\nSoon it was time for\
  \ tea. We had sausages and mash. It was only as I sat down at the table and tucked\
  \ my serviette under my chin that I realised I'd put my head on back to front.\n\
