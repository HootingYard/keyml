text: "On the day Hattie Jacques died, Dobson was slumped in the vestibule of a large\
  \ and shabby hotel, to which he had been summoned by a captain of industry. The\
  \ out of print pamphleteer was on the verge his dotage, but was not quite there\
  \ yet. If anything, his lucidity was terrifying. There were egg stains on his cravat.\n\
  The captain of industry failed to turn up, leaving Dobson in the lurch. At a loose\
  \ end, and with barely a penny in his pockets, he slumped in the vestibule. The\
  \ hotel did not have a commissionaire, or indeed anybody who cared that a pamphleteer\
  \ was blocking the entrance, smelling faintly of egg.\nHattie Jacques died of a\
  \ heart attack on the sixth of October 1980. The captain of industry whom Dobson\
  \ was expecting to meet had died a day earlier. Nobody thought to look in his appointments\
  \ diary. Even if they had, it would have beflummoxed them, for the captain of industry\
  \ used an unbreakable code. He did this to lend himself an air of importance.\n\
  Of Norman Wisdom, with whom she appeared in The Square Peg and Follow A Star, Hattie\
  \ Jacques said he was \u201Cdifficult and self-centred\u201D. The same could be\
  \ said of Dobson. Indeed, he wrote as much, in a pamphlet entitled Why I Can Be\
  \ Difficult And Self-Centred (out of print). Presenting an obstacle to anyone who\
  \ wanted to enter or leave the semidilapidated hotel that afternoon was but one\
  \ instance of this.\nA number of people stepped over the slumped pamphleteer that\
  \ day. Some even trod on him, so frantic was their haste. Dobson did not complain,\
  \ for he was past caring. He was composing an essay in his head, as he often did,\
  \ so that when he returned eventually to his escritoire he could scribble away at\
  \ high speed. Sometimes he wrote so quickly that he scorched his notepaper.\nThe\
  \ dead captain of industry had arranged to meet Dobson because he wanted the pamphleteer\
  \ to write his biography. As we have seen, he had a massive and delusional sense\
  \ of his own importance, and felt that only a master of majestic sweeping prose\
  \ such as Dobson could do justice to his life. By any objective measure it had been\
  \ a colourless and godawful life, devoted almost entirely to the manufacture and\
  \ sale of buttons.\nHattie Jacques sported many buttons made by the captain of industry's\
  \ button company during the second world war, when she worked as an arc welder.\
  \ The company provided the welding factory with all its buttons, and made its fortune\
  \ in so doing. It was in the factory that Hattie Jacques nurtured her comic talents.\n\
  Dobson had been apprised of the reason for his abortive meeting, and, slumped in\
  \ the vestibule, was tussling with a title. The Life Of A Buttoneer appealed to\
  \ him, but there was already a book of that name, an adventure story by the bestselling\
  \ paperbackist Pebblehead set in Wivenhoe and Cuxhaven. \u201CA rip-roaring and\
  \ emotionally wrenching rollercoaster ride!\u201D exclaimed the review in Book Reviews\
  \ With Lots of Exclamation Marks magazine.\nLike Hattie Jacques\u2019 ex-husband\
  \ John Le Mesurier, the captain of industry had arranged his own death notice to\
  \ appear in the newspaper. It read \u201CDecisively Important Maker Of Buttons Is\
  \ Dead. Keep buying his buttons so his name lives on for thousands of years.\u201D\
  \ One of the people who trod on Dobson in the hotel vestibule dropped his newspaper\
  \ as he did so, and the page with the buttoneer's death notice came to rest upon\
  \ the pamphleteer's egg stained cravat. He made no attempt to move it.\nHattie Jacques\
  \ was buried in St Paul's Churchyard in London. The captain of industry's body lay\
  \ undiscovered in his captainy penthouse flat, where it was gnawed by rats and mice.\
  \ Eventually it was tossed into a furnace by a feckless janitor. The shabby hotel\
  \ vestibule was not Dobson's final resting place, thank god. At some point in the\
  \ evening of that October day, he bestirred himself, scrunched up the newspaper\
  \ that had fallen on him and shoved it into his pocket, finessed the cravat about\
  \ his neck, and plodded home, difficult and self-centred, like Norman Wisdom, along\
  \ lamplit streets. He had a while left before his dotage descended upon him.\n\n\
