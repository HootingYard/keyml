text: "\u201CIt has been observed that in their treatment of the Western frontier\
  \ Bret Harte made the prevalent contempt for the law picturesque and Mark Twain\
  \ found it humorous, but Ambrose Bierce labeled it for what it was\u2014murder,\
  \ armed robbery, assault with intent to kill. His occasional essays into Western\
  \ crime were as bluntly stated as a police blotter: no chivalrous gamblers, just\
  \ cardsharks; no courtly gunfighters, just homicidal psychopaths; no golden-hearted\
  \ dancehall girls, just pathetic whores; no gallant soldiers nor stouthearted pioneers,\
  \ just men on the government payroll bored by routine and farmers looking for a\
  \ better piece of land. The Western legend was, to use his favourite word, bosh.\u201D\
