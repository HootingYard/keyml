  \ the last century I produced four or five calendars. Each of these had a specific\
  \ theme, thus the 1992 Hooting Yard Calendar was entitled Accidental Deaths Of Twelve\
  \ Cartographers, while its 1993 successor commemorated The Golden Days of the Bodger's\
  \ Spinney Variety Theatre. In 1994 I thought to illustrate a fictional work of fiction\
  \ (Fangs In The Mist\u2014a phrase stolen from J. P. Donleavy) and, in casting about\
  \ within my bonce for a suitable name for the fictional author, I lit upon Chlorine\
  \ Winslow. \u201CChlorine\u201D, it seemed to me, sounded like it might well have\
  \ been a popular girl's name in Victorian times, and I recall that I chuckled immoderately\
  \ to myself having decided upon it.\nNow, years later, I discover this:\nMrs [Leonora]\
  \ Piper had become a medium in 1883. The thing had happened in the usual way\u2014\
  by contagion. She had been suffering from a tumour and had gone to visit a medium\
  \ who gave medical consultations, but who also specialized in developing latent\
  \ mediumship in others. At her first sitting Mrs Piper felt very agitated and thought\
  \ she was going to faint. On the next occasion, the medium put his hands on her\
  \ forehead. Once more she was on the point of losing consciousness. She saw a flood\
  \ of light, unrecognisable faces, and a hand which fluttered before her own face.\
  \ She then passed out. When she came to, although she could remember nothing, she\
  \ was told that a young Indian girl named.,incredibly, Chlorine, had manifested\
  \ through her and had given a remarkable proof of survival after death.\nFrom The\
