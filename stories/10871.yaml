  \ Mary Wilks -\u201D\nSince the turn of the year I have been immersing myself in\
  \ the novels of Ronald Firbank. The quotation above, from Valmouth (1919), is a\
  \ list of the centenarians of the eponymous townlet, where something in the air\
  \ means \u201CValmouth centenarians will be soon as common as peas!\u201D This is\
  \ the only one of Firbank's books I have read previously, and because I have a chronological\
  \ list of every book I have read over the past thirty years, I can date that earlier\
  \ reading to 1989.\nTwo years earlier, in 1987, under the Malice Aforethought Press\
  \ imprint, I published a set of twenty-six alphabetic potted biographies entitled\
  \ A Zest For Crumpled Things. The fifth of these was named . . . Violet Ebbing.\
  \ I still remember the weird tingle of surprise as I read Firbank in 1989 and saw\
  \ that name, which I had plucked out of the aether. What spooky forces were at work?,\
  \ I wondered, and still wonder.\nI don't think I have ever put the text of A Zest\
  \ For Crumpled Things online, so I shall endeavour to do so at some point. Meanwhile,\
  \ it seems you can pick up a copy for the bargain price of \xA388.44 here.\n[2013-01-21]"
