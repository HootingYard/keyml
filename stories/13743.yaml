text: "Peter Blegvad, from \u201CThe Unborn Byron\u201D:\nSpread the word, tomorrow\
  \ morn\n  A future poet shall be born.\n  From my mother I shall fall\n  Into the\
  \ womb that holds us all.\n  My life shall be a meteor\n  Which generations shall\
  \ adore.\n  For my unbuttoned liberty\n  The unborn will remember me.\nMr Key, from\
  \ \u201CThe Tiny Newborn Mr Key\u201D:\n1959, this very morn\n  The tiny Mr Key\
  \ was born\n  He was a full month premature\n  When he knocked his fist upon the\
  \ door\n  Of the world beyond his mother's womb\n  A tiny bright spark in the gloom\n\
  \  And soon the words poured out of him\n  They pour out still, with ceaseless vim.\n\
