text: "I had some guns and I had some butter. Early in life, one learns to put guns\
  \ before butter, even though if one were to follow the alphabet strictly, one would\
  \ put butter before guns. But I learned my lessons well, so whenever I buy a new\
  \ dictionary, and I often do, I turn immediately to the section of words beginning\
  \ with G, find the entry for \u201Cguns\u201D, snip it out with a sharp pair of\
  \ scissors, then leaf back through the dictionary to the section of words beginning\
  \ with B, locate the entry for \u201Cbutter\u201D, then paste in the snipped-out\
  \ section just above it, with mucilage. Of course, what this all means is that I\
  \ have a hole in my dictionary and a gap on the reverse of the page where \u201C\
  guns\u201D appeared, and also I have obscured the text just above the entry for\
  \ \u201Cbutter\u201D by pasting my snippage over it. But this is a small price to\
  \ pay for following the edict drummed into me by my parents and my schoolteachers\
  \ and my military chaplains, one which I have never called into question, though\
  \ at times I have been tempted to do so.\nYes, sad to say there was a time when\
  \ I was beset by anxiety dreams, in which I was poised, with a sharp pair of scissors,\
  \ to cut out \u201Cguns\u201D and its definition from a brand new dictionary, the\
  \ pot of mucilage and a spatula beside the dictionary on the desk, and my hand trembled\
  \ and I could not make the snip. I had this dream, or nightmare, over and over again\
  \ for a number of years. In a more alarming variant, I dreamed that I managed to\
  \ cut out the \u201Cguns\u201D entry, but then mislaid it, or dropped it into a\
  \ wastepaper bin, or it was consumed by flames and I had but a pile of ash, which\
  \ I then painstakingly tried to paste, atom by atom, into the dictionary, with mucilage,\
  \ and I would wake up shrieking.\nOddly, it never occurred to me to snip out the\
  \ definition for \u201Cbutter\u201D and paste it, with mucilage, immediately after\
  \ \u201Cguns\u201D in the dictionary. Had I ever done so, the net result would have\
  \ been the same. I would still have had a hole and a gap and an obscured definition,\
  \ one for a word beginning with G rather than with B.\nI have always made it a habit\
  \ to be in possession of both guns and butter, but to be very clear about which\
  \ takes priority. When laying my breakfast table of a morning, for example, now\
  \ I can no longer afford a valet and have to fend for myself, I always place a pair\
  \ of pistols on the tablecloth first, and the butter dish second. All other necessaries\u2014\
  toast-rack, plate, bowl, nutcracker, and so on\u2014can be laid out in any old order\
  \ I choose, as haphazard as you like. But I have learned through experience that\
  \ if I put the butter dish on the breakfast table before the guns, I suffer from\
  \ terrible indigestion thereafter. Such is the power of the mind. Clearly there\
  \ is no physiological reason why I will be stricken with gastric horrors in such\
  \ circumstances, for breakfast is the same every morning, with minor variants. Special\
  \ K, buttered toast, a handful of filberts and a pot of tea are the four essential\
  \ items, to which I might add some eggs or porridge, or eggy porridge, but rarely,\
  \ rarely.\nI will usually handle the firearms while chewing my toast, checking they\
  \ are well oiled and primed, the chambers fully loaded with bullets, and the safety\
  \ catches on. When I had a valet, I liked to amuse myself by taking pot shots at\
  \ him, first with one pistol and then with the other, while chewing my toast. He\
  \ was a lithe valet, as valets go, and he always managed to leap and vault and jump\
  \ and shimmy out of the paths of the bullets, until that Thursday morning when he\
  \ did not.\nAnother instance of my putting guns before butter is when packing my\
  \ things for a camping and hiking trip. First I pack my guns, then, following Gould's\
  \ system, in order, my axe (in cover), axle-grease, bacon, barometer (pocket), bean-pot,\
  \ beans (in bag), beef (dried), beeswax, Bible, blacking and brush, blankets, boxes,\
  \ bread for lunch, brogans (oiled), broom, canned goods, chalk, cheese, clothes-brush,\
  \ cod-line, coffee and pot, comb, compass, condensed milk, cups, currycomb, dates,\
  \ dippers, dishes, dish-towels, drawers, dried fruits, Dutch oven, envelopes, figs,\
  \ firkin, fishing-tackle, flour (prepared), frying-pan, guide-book, half-barrel,\
  \ halter, hammer, hard-bread, harness (examine!), hatchet, haversack, ink (portable\
  \ bottle), knives (sheath, table, pocket and butcher), lemons, liniment, lunch for\
  \ day or two, maps, matches and safe, marline, meal (in bag), meal-bag, medicines,\
  \ milk-can, molasses, money (\u201Cchange\u201D), monkey-wrench, mosquito-bar, mustard\
  \ and pot, nails, neat's-foot oil, night-shirt, oatmeal, oil-can, opera-glass, overcoat,\
  \ padlock and key, pails, paper, paper collars, pens, pepper, pickles, pins, portfolio,\
  \ postage stamps, postal cards, rope, rubber blanket, rubber coat, rubber boots,\
  \ sail-needle, salt, salt fish, salt pork, salve, saw, shingles (for plates), shirts,\
  \ shoes and strings, slippers, soap, song-book, spade, spoons, stove (utensils in\
  \ bags), sugar, tea, tents, tent poles, tent pins, tooth-brush, towels, twine, vinegar,\
  \ watch and key, and then at the very last the butter-dish and cover, with the butter\
  \ in it. An unfortunate consequence of this system, and one which still occasionally\
  \ has me tempted to wonder if my parents and my schoolteachers and my military chaplains\
  \ were indeed correct in their insistence on guns before butter, is that if one\
  \ needs one's guns as a matter of urgency, there is a great deal of unpacking and\
  \ rummaging and faffing in order to get at them.\nI remember that once, for example,\
  \ I set out on a hike, and had got no further than a few yards beyond my garden\
  \ gate when I was saw, looming ahead of me, a sleuth of ferocious bears. Frantically,\
  \ I unpacked and rummaged and faffed, but by the time I lay hold of my guns I had\
  \ had one of my arms torn off and a bloodied lip. Luckily, one shot of my pistol\
  \ into the air and the ferocious bears became cowardly, and scattered. When I told\
  \ this tale to a military chaplain in the clinic where they fitted my prosthetic\
  \ arm, he explained to me that I ought to have used the easily-accessible, because\
  \ last packed, butter to smear a greasy patch between myself and the bears, upon\
  \ which they would have slipped and toppled over, giving me plenty of time to unpack\
  \ and rummage and faff for the guns.\n\u201CBut then,\u201D I protested, \u201C\
  I would have no butter for my toast during the hike, Padre.\u201D\n\u201CYou are\
  \ clearly unfamiliar, my child,\u201D he said, \u201CWith that piece of countryside\
  \ wisdom which goes: \u2018In river, stream and rill catch thee perch and pike,\
  \ But never butter your toast when you're going on a hike\u2019.\u201D\nI had not\
  \ heard that, but it made a lot of sense. I did wonder where a military chaplain\
  \ had picked up rustic lore, but he further explained to me that before taking religious\
  \ orders he had, for many years, been a peasant, and still from time to time had\
  \ bits of straw stuck in his hair. I felt very fortunate indeed to have him as my\
  \ spiritual adviser. My late valet, bless his cotton socks, had also tried to dispense\
  \ pearls of wisdom, and he too had been a peasant before going to valet school,\
  \ but one thing that always struck me was that he had no view at all on the primacy\
  \ of guns over butter. I would, for example, summon him to fetch my snippy scissors\
  \ and pot of mucilage and spatula whenever I bought a new dictionary. Rather than\
  \ simply doing as he was bidden, like an ideal valet, he would sigh and shuffle\
  \ from foot to foot, even going so far as to suggest that I might for once leave\
  \ my dictionary unmodified, with \u201Cbutter\u201D before \u201Cguns\u201D, and\
  \ employ my time instead with a less exacting activity, such as playing the harmonica\
  \ or doing conjuring tricks. I had but to lay hold of one of my pistols, in easy\
  \ reach on the table just in front of the butter, and point it at his head, and\
  \ he scarpered in search of the scissors and mucilage and spatula. I suspect he\
  \ would not have been so attentive had I picked up and pointed at him a knob of\
  \ butter, which just goes to show how right my parents and my schoolteachers and\
  \ my military chaplains were all along.\n[2011-10-15]"
