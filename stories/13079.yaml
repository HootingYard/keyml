text: "Hail to thee, O mighty Mr Key!, writes Tim Thurn, sarcastically, before lapsing\
  \ into his usual embittered petulance, I've got a bone to pick with you. It is a\
  \ good few years now since you revealed, without warning, the existence of the hideous\
  \ bat-god Fatso, a god so hideous and batty and fat that I suffered from awful nightmares\
  \ for weeks, nay, months. Eventually, with the help of several psychiatrists and\
  \ a larder's-worth of bottles of Dr Baxter's Brain-Calming Syrup, I managed to get\
  \ a grip on my life. Nowadays my sleep is relatively untroubled, except for those\
  \ nights when I wake with a start and seem to see the hideous bat-god Fatso looming\
  \ malevolently at the foot of my bed.\nImagine my horror, then, to read your postage\
  \ the other day entitled The Smashed God and to learn that there is another bat-god,\
  \ called Slosher. I don't know what the opposite of blessing my little cotton socks\
  \ is\u2014I leave that for your readers to ponder\u2014but that is what you have\
  \ done, Mr Key. Maddeningly, you provided no description of the bat-god Slosher,\
  \ save for telling us that he is a bat-god and his name is Slosher. In the absence\
  \ of any other detail, my mind has been running riot, picturing a god even more\
  \ hideous, more batty, and fatter than Fatso. Now they visit me nightly, Fatso and\
  \ Slosher, or their ghostly apparitions, one on either side of the bed. I swear\
  \ I can hear them squeaking. I have emptied the chemist's shop of bottles of Dr\
  \ Baxter's Brain-Calming Syrup, and glugged the lot, but my brain is by no means\
  \ calm.\nWhat rankles is that you make passing mention of Slosher, in among all\
  \ sorts of other, non-terrifying, gods, for all the world as if you were innocently\
  \ listing the contents of your picnic hamper. I presume you have a picnic hamper.\
  \ If not, I have a couple of spares, for I am\u2014or was\u2014a very keen picnickist.\
  \ In a fit of wild generosity, I would almost be prepared to send you one of my\
  \ extra hampers, empty of course, in spite of the chaos you have wrought in my brain.\
  \ That is the kind of decent picnickist I am. Unlike you, I issue warnings. When\
  \ I plan to enter a field to lay out my picnic blanket, I first alert any cows,\
  \ sheep, grasshoppers, etcetera of my intentions by hoisting a placard and sounding\
  \ a picnic-klaxon. That is what you ought to do, or the prose equivalent thereof,\
  \ when you are about to tell us about yet another hideous bat-god, be it Fatso or\
  \ Slosher or, Christ have mercy upon us, any others you have up your sleeve that\
  \ you have not yet divulged to your fanatically devoted readers who treat every\
  \ syllable scribbled by your pen as holy writ.\nThere. I have said my piece for\
  \ the time being. Now I am going to go and stand, windswept, embittered, and petulant,\
  \ upon a suspension bridge, gazing into the distance, into a sky I hope will be\
  \ innocent of bats and bat-gods.\nYours ever, Tim Thurn\nI would like to reassure\
  \ Tim that the bat-god Slosher is only ever to be spotted in the vicinity of the\
  \ drearier and more squelchy marshes, places where he is unlikely to practise his\
  \ picnicking.\n[2014-08-21]"
