text: "\nThe picture above is a still from Alan Bridges\u2019 1985 film The Shooting\
  \ Party, based on Isobel Colegate's novel of 1981. James Mason plays Sir Randolph\
  \ Nettleby, landowner, enthusiastic bird-shooter, and budding pamphleteer. John\
  \ Gielgud's character is giving him some pamphleteering tips, having had his tract\
  \ on animal rights printed by an \u201Canarchist in Dorking\u201D. Earlier, Gielgud\
  \ has been marching about the field brandishing a placard in an attempt to disrupt\
  \ the bird-shoot. Intriguingly, the name of Gielgud's character is Cornelius Cardew.\
  \ Mere coincidence, or was Isobel Colegate gently teasing another upper class Englishman\
  \ given to protest and to the brandishing of placards? And are there any other instances\
  \ of fictional characters being given the names of English Maoist avant garde composers?\n\
