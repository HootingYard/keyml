text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis of\
  \ classic songs, starting with \u201CSuzanne\u201D by Leonard Cohen. And when I\
  \ say \u201Cclose\u201D, I mean close\u2014in my attempt to winkle out the deep\
  \ meaning of the song I concentrate on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the\
  \ rest of it. And when I say \u201Cwinkle\u201D, well, as you will discover when\
  \ you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy organic life-forms of the tide\
  \ pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore hidden deep structure of the\
  \ song.\nOne unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation that\
  \ there is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent lobster\
  \ research. I make no great claims for what we might call \u201Cthe Suzanne lobster\u201D\
  , but it suffices, I think, that the word \u201Clobsters\u201D appears, not at all\
  \ gratuitously, in my analysis.\nThese are hideously complicated matters, but I\
  \ hope I have been able to shed some little light on them.\n[2011-09-09]"
