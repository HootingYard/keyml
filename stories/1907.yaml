text: "Yesterday, V I Foxglove mentioned a ruffian from Klosterheim, or The Masque,\
  \ and I notice that the day before, over at Laudator Temporis Acti, Michael Gilleland\
  \ posted a marvellous bit of De Quincey:\n\u201CTo begin with his figure:\u2014\
  \ Wordsworth was, upon the whole, not a well-made man. His legs were pointedly condemned\
  \ by all the female connoisseurs in legs that ever I heard lecture upon that topic;\
  \ not that they were bad in any way which would force itself upon your notice \u2014\
  \ there was no absolute deformity about them; and undoubtedly they had been serviceable\
  \ legs beyond the average standard of human requisition; for I calculate, upon good\
  \ data, that with these identical legs Wordsworth must have traversed a distance\
  \ of 175 to 180,000 English miles \u2014 a mode of exertion which, to him, stood\
  \ in the stead of wine, spirits, and all other stimulants whatsoever to the animal\
  \ spirits; to which he has been indebted for a life of unclouded happiness, and\
  \ we for much of what is most excellent in his writings. But, useful as they have\
  \ proved themselves, the Wordsworthian legs were certainly not ornamental; and it\
  \ was really a pity, as I agreed with a lady in thinking, that he had not another\
  \ pair for evening dress parties \u2014 when no boots lend their friendly aid to\
  \ masque our imperfections from the eyes of female rigorists \u2014 the elegantes\
  \ formarum spectatrices. A sculptor would certainly have disapproved of their contour.\u201D\
  \nFrom Literary Reminiscences, chapter X (William Wordsworth)\nDe Quincey seems\
  \ to think that the wearing of boots can pull the wool over the eyes of female rigorists,\
  \ but this was certainly not the case with Marigold Chew. Indeed, it was the boots\
  \ Dobson trudged around in that often caused her acute, even physical, disgust.\
  \ The out of print pamphleteer had a huge and unlikely collection of boots, including\
  \ those of the Austrian Postal Service and the Nova Scotian Seabird Tagging Patrol.\
  \ Unlike John Prescott, he usually managed to pair them up correctly.*\n* NOTE\_\
  : In his forthcoming mem-wa A View From The Foothills, Chris Mullin MP writes: \u201C\
  [Prescott's] black mood is compounded by the fact that he has come to work this\
  \ morning wearing unmatching shoes. We are permitted a brief giggle at this. Towards\
  \ the end of the meeting a minion appears with a plastic bag containing an assortment\
  \ of shoes.\u201D\n[2009-02-25]"
