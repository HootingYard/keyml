text: "\u201CA rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\u201D is perhaps Gertrude Stein's\
  \ most memorable utterance. It first appeared in the 1913 poem Sacred Emily (published\
  \ in 1922 in the collection Geography And Plays) as \u201CRose is a rose is a rose\
  \ is a rose\u201D, the first Rose being a proper name. There are other lines in\
  \ the poem of which I am very fond, including:\nIt is rose in hen\u2026 Weeds without\
  \ papers are necessary\u2026 Humming does as humming is\u2026 Electrics are tight\
  \ electrics are white electrics are a button\u2026\_ A very reasonable berry\u2026\
  \ A coral neck and a little song so very extra so very Susie\u2026 Cow come out\
  \ cow come out and out and smell a little\u2026 Websters and mines, websters and\
  \ mines\u2026 Cunning piler\u2026 Thimble of everything.\nADDENDUM\_: For more about\
  \ Gertrude Stein and cows, go here.\n[2010-06-16]"
