text: "The first in our Occasional Graveyards series is a shrine to a graveyard rather\
  \ than a graveyard as such. You can read about the Cross Bones Graveyard here. It\
  \ is about five minutes walk from the ResonanceFM studio on Borough High Street,\
  \ so next time you listen to Hooting Yard On The Air, bear in mind that Mr Key may\
  \ well have been pondering the Eternal Verities at the shrine just beforehand, or\
  \ possibly soon afterwards. The photographs were taken by Pansy Cradledew, who has\
  \ not posted them on a flickr page, because she's not that kind of girl.\n\n\_\n\
