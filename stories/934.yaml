text: "It\_was the month of January, 1516.\nThe night was dark and tempestuous; the\
  \ thunder growled around; the lightning flashed at short intervals: and the wind\
  \ swept furiously along in sudden and fitful gusts.\nThe streams of the great Black\
  \ Forest of Germany babbled in playful melody no more, but rushed on with deafening\
  \ din, mingling their torrent roar with the wild creaking of the huge oaks, the\
  \ rustling of the firs, the howling of the affrighted wolves, and the hollow voices\
  \ of the storm.\nThe dense black clouds were driving restlessly athwart the sky;\
  \ and when the vivid lightning gleamed forth with rapid and eccentric glare, it\
  \ seemed as if the dark jaws of some hideous monster, floating high above, opened\
  \ to vomit flame.\nAnd as the abrupt but furious gusts of wind swept through the\
  \ forest, they raised strange echoes\u2014as if the impervious mazes of that mighty\
  \ wood were the abode of hideous fiends and evil spirits, who responded in shrieks,\
  \ moans, and lamentations to the fearful din of the tempest.\nIt was, indeed, an\
  \ appalling night!\nAn old\u2014old man sat in his cottage on the verge of the Black\
  \ Forest.\nHe had numbered ninety years; his head was completely bald\u2014his mouth\
  \ was toothless\u2014his long beard was white as snow, and his limbs were feeble\
  \ and trembling.\nfrom Wagner, The Wehr-Wolf by George W M Reynolds\n[2008-11-11]"
