text: "Readers will recall the podcast Airy Persiflage, wherein from time to time\
  \ its onlie begetter, Walter O'Hara, turns his attentions to scribblings by Mr Key\
  \ and the recitation thereof. In his latest outpourings for podpersons, Mr O'Hara\
  \ tackles Ambrose And Signor Ploppo (accompanied by \u201Cyoung Gar\u201D) and The\
  \ Cruel Sea.\nIt is perhaps worth giving some background to Mr O'Hara's choice of\
  \ the latter piece. The other day, he \u201Cbefriended\u201D me on Facebookcloth.\
  \ There, I noted that he can lay claim to having posted the most sensible status\
  \ update ever to appear on the social networking site, a transcription of The Cruel\
  \ Sea in its entirety. Several of his Facecloth friends wondered what he was wittering\
  \ on about and made various (wrong) guesses before he revealed the sordid truth.\
  \ At which point I stepped in to say how delighted I would be were he to recite\
  \ the piece on his podcast. And lo! it came to pass!\nComplete and (initially) unattributed\
  \ transcription of Hooting Yard texts as Facecloth updates is clearly the way forward.\
  \ Let us hope it catches on.\n[2011-07-28]"
