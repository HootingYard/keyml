  it is territory where Brit at Think Of England stands proudly alone, far above the
  petty doings of mere mortals.

  I do think it worth mentioning, however, that next month I shall be taking a trip
  to Mortlake, where I shall be served with a nice cup of tea accompanied by a cupcake
  emblazoned with the Monas Hieroglyphica of the Elizabethan magus Dr John Dee. See
  below, for the mystic symbol, if not the cupcake, which I assume has yet to be baked.
  A full report on this extremely sensible outing will follow in due course.
