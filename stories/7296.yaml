text: "I have often asked myself if I was born to boogie. Born to mewl and puke, yes.\
  \ To scratch and gobble and preen, most certainly. And in the end, to kick the bucket,\
  \ and feed the worms, or, wedged in my final box, ignited, to blaze in glory. But\
  \ inbetweentimes, must I, can I, boogie? Was it writ in the stars, spread out across\
  \ the firmament in their particular alignment at the moment of my birth, that I\
  \ should boogie?\nOnce, on a Wednesday I recall, I studied and studied a chart of\
  \ those stars, but I learned nothing. Partly that was because I did not really know\
  \ what I ought to be looking for, partly because the chart had been dropped in a\
  \ puddle and was smudged. I gazed at it for hours on that Wednesday, hoping for\
  \ enlightenment of a boogie-related kind, but eventually I gave up and crumpled\
  \ the chart in my fist and tossed it into a dustbin.\nI was told, also on a Wednesday,\
  \ but a different Wednesday, that to properly boogie one had to wear a boogie-hat\
  \ and a shirt with boogie-cuffs and a pair of boogie shoes. But the person who told\
  \ me this was unreliable, in matters boogie at any rate, for he had never, to the\
  \ best of my knowledge, himself boogied. He just spouted off about boogie, one of\
  \ those boogie-spouters who were so tiresomely prevalent at one time. Some people\
  \ feel nostalgic for that time, of course, even weep when they think of it, but\
  \ not me. I couldn't give a monkey's.\nIt was another person who told me, and not\
  \ on a Wednesday this time, but a Sunday, that if I wanted to witness proper boogie\
  \ I should make a beeline for the monkey house. Apparently, monkeys boogie better\
  \ than any other creature on earth. They truly were born to boogie. I am not sure\
  \ this is the truth. I hoped to study a chart, not dissimilar to the chart o\u2019\
  \ stars, but a chart of monkeys, one that had not been dropped into a puddle and\
  \ smudged, but try as I might I could not get my mittens on one. The whole monkey\
  \ boogie business is still up in the air as far as I am concerned. And I cannot\
  \ quiz the person who told me to get me hence to the monkey house, for in a quite\
  \ unrelated development, he was found hanging from a bridge over an important river,\
  \ his pockets weighted with stones. They said he had boogie in his eyes at the last,\
  \ but what in heaven's name that might mean I have no idea.\nIt has been pointed\
  \ out to me, more than once, that had I been born to boogie I would have boogied\
  \ by now. Well, frustum dustum, as they say, that is a persuasive point. If I started\
  \ to boogie today, or next week, or in whatever years are left to me, would there\
  \ not be something forced and artificial about my boogie, a knowingness that would\
  \ be fatal to the boogie itself? Thereagain, some have posited the idea of the past-it\
  \ boogie, or the creaking wizened boogie, as not uncommon variations on the classic\
  \ boogie, which I suppose might be defined as the boogie practised by monkeys, if\
  \ indeed monkeys do actually boogie, and I was not being lied to, yet again.\nI\
  \ shall retrieve that smudged star-chart from the dustbin, and hop it down to the\
  \ monkey house, and perhaps, perhaps, things will become clear to me, at least in\
  \ terms of boogie.\n[2011-09-15]"
