text: "Today is the first day of the Muggletonian Great Holiday, celebrated on the\
  \ third, fourth and fifth of February each year. On those three days in 1652, the\
  \ tailor John Reeve (1608\u20131658) received his commission from God, and was told\
  \ that his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton (1609\u20131698) was to be his \u201Cmouth\u201D\
  . Reeve learned that he and Muggleton were the two witnesses referred to in Revelations\
  \ 11:3, and that God had empowered them to pronounce upon the fate of individuals.\
  \ As Muggleton wrote in his 1663 tract The Neck of The Quakers Broken, \u201CHe\
  \ hath put the two-edged Sword of His Spirit into my Mouth, that whosoever I pronounce\
  \ cursed through my Mouth, is cursed to Eternity\u201D.\nIt was long thought that,\
  \ of all the sects which sprang up in the English Civil War period, only the Quakers\
  \ survived into the twentieth century. During the 1970s, however, one Philip Noakes\
  \ came to light in Kent, a living Muggletonian in possession of a huge archive of\
  \ material covering the sect's entire history.\nThe Muggletonians believed that\
  \ human reason was unclean. This led them to reject physical science. They refused\
  \ to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of mathematics, and they considered\
  \ astronomy to be wrong. The stars, they said, were only as big as God made them\
  \ appear from earth. In later years, Muggletonians banned hot air ballooning, because\
  \ the balloons would crash into the sky, a solid band around the earth.\n\nPortrait\

  \ Andy Hopton, whose 1988 essay in Small Press Gleanings is my source\u2014and was\
  \ my introduction to the sect.\n[2012-02-03]"
