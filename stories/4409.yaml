text: "For those of us whose knowledge of the world is gleaned almost exclusively\
  \ from the out of print pamphlets of Dobson, it comes as a crushing blow to learn\
  \ that he was absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong in the matter of the mythical island\
  \ o\u2019 werewolves. You will recall that in his pamphlet The Mythical Island Where\
  \ Werewolves Think They Come From (out of print), Dobson claims there is, within\
  \ the brain of every werewolf, some sort of false memory nugget which throbs with\
  \ the sights and sounds and smells of a wholly imaginary island. This, he says,\
  \ is thought by all werewolves to be their homeland, to which they are driven to\
  \ return, with an impulse as savage and unassuageable as their hunger for blood\
  \ and guts. Hence the danger of docks and harbours, where werewolves roam, trying\
  \ to stow away aboard ships and clippers and ocean liners.\nYou will also recall\
  \ that in the 1956 film Bigger Than Life, James Mason, as cortisone-addled schoolteacher\
  \ Ed Avery, declaims, as only James Mason could, the line \u201CGod was wrong!\u201D\
  \ Shocking that may have been to a 1950s audience, but how much more shocking is\
  \ it, today, to utter the words, or even to entertain the thought, \u201CDobson\
  \ was wrong!\u201D? Yet, unbelievably, that indeed appears to be the case, according\
  \ to a new study by jumped-up young Dobsonist Ted Cack. In five hundred pages of\
  \ densely argued and pretty prose, the wet behind the ears little squirt pulls apart\
  \ the pamphleteer's pronouncements upon werewolves, demonstrating them to be complete\
  \ drivel.\n\u201CAh!\u201D you may cry, \u201CBut what about all those footnotes?\u201D\
  \ It is true that The Mythical Island\u2026 is one of Dobson's most heavily annotated\
  \ works, bulging with an apparatus of footnotes and references and scholarly appendices.\
  \ So bulky did all this stuff make the first edition of the pamphlet that, when\
  \ running off the first few copies in the shed, Marigold Chew broke her Gestetner\
  \ machine and had to call out a person from Porlock to repair it. That is why the\
  \ additional material was published as a separate pamphlet thereafter, the pair\
  \ of pamphlets bunged together into a cardboard box, to which was stuck with glue\
  \ a mezzotint of a werewolf done by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. It is perhaps\
  \ the most sought-after Dobson rarity coveted by collectors, which makes Ted Cack's\
  \ revelations all the more dispiriting.\nWhat on earth can have made Dobson deceive\
  \ his readers so? It is not a question Ted Cack tries to answer, but then he is\
  \ young and callow and has not yet gained a proper apprehension of Man's fallen\
  \ state. The fruit of the tree of knowledge is not a fruit Ted Cack has bitten,\
  \ yet. His time will come, as it does to us all, as it certainly did to Dobson.\n\
  Because the pimpled youngster does not address Dobson's motives for churning out\
  \ this screed of twaddle, we are forced to draw our own conclusions. For what it\
  \ is worth, and despite the evidence piled up against him, I think it is legitimate\
  \ to ask if Dobson actually believed the absurdities he wrote of werewolves. It\
  \ would not be the first time he was subject to delusions, hallucinations, and general\
  \ brainpan dislodgement. The critic Bernard Levin wrote of Beatleperson John Lennon\
  \ that \u201Cthere is nothing wrong with [him] that could not be cured by standing\
  \ him upside down and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls\
  \ out.\u201D The same was true of Dobson, if not more so. In fact, Marigold Chew\
  \ designed, but never got round to building, a sort of hoist, of deal and wicker\
  \ and gutta percha, into which the pamphleteer could be pinned, upended, and shaken\
  \ about. Had such treatment been applied, perhaps on Thursday mornings, before breakfast,\
  \ Dobson might never have cast so ineradicable a blot upon his reputation as The\
  \ Mythical Island Where Werewolves Think They Come From.\nSo did he think it was\
  \ true? Did he just wilfully misread all those quotations and references with which\
  \ the pamphlet is packed? The problem here is that he seems to have invented most\
  \ of his sources, from ancient texts in Latin and Greek and Ugric, to scripts from\
  \ films and radio plays, and a paragraph about werewolves apparently copied down\
  \ from the back of a carton of breakfast cereal. Tellingly, Dobson does not say\
  \ what the cereal was, and in any case, the pamphlet was written at a time when\
  \ we know he only ever ate bloaters for breakfast. Oh, it is a puzzle to be sure!\n\
  A clue may be found by close reading of his earlier werewolf pamphlet, The Hidden\
  \ Wealth Of Werewolves (out of print), the one where he bangs on about werewolves\
  \ living in caves wherein are kept toads in hanging cages, the toads having jewels\
  \ embedded in their heads. It all sounds a bit unlikely, doesn't it? Did he invent\
  \ that, too? Ted Cack ignores this pamphlet completely, but then perhaps he has\
  \ never heard of it. To gain a familiarity with the entire corpus of Dobson's work\
  \ takes years and years, as I know to my cost. And I have decades yet to live, God\
  \ willing, before I am as ancient and craggy and stooped and wizened as Aloysius\
  \ Nestingbird, the greatest Dobsonist of all, who is well into his second century\
  \ and has collected several free bus passes from the government. He sells the spare\
  \ ones on a website called Nestingbird-Bay, and spends the proceeds on gruel, which\
  \ is all he is able to digest after long years of debauch.\nThe point about the\
  \ first werewolf pamphlet is that Dobson always denied having written it. He claimed\
  \ it was a forgery, wrought by sinister and shadowy associates of international\
  \ woman of mystery Primrose Dent. If this is indeed the case, it would be a fool\
  \ who would dare to investigate further. Let us not forget that the last person\
  \ to probe the doings of La Belle Dent, a television reporter even more pimply and\
  \ callow than Ted Cack, was pinned, upended, and shaken about in a hoist umpteen\
  \ times more terrifying than Marigold Chew's unrealised design. I am not joking.\
  \ That is why I am going to stop writing about the whole confounded business, and\
  \ go for a walk down by the docks, where I may or may not be set upon by marauding\
  \ werewolves. And if I am, it will be a fate far less horrifying than Primrose Dent's\
  \ hoist.\n[2010-05-04]"
