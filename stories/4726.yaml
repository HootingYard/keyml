text: "It is quite some time since I have heard from Dr Ruth Pastry, but at last she\
  \ has broken her silence. Here is her letter:\nDear Mr Key\_: Last week I read your\
  \ postage Poultry Yards Of The Grand Archdukes and, though I was not impressed,\
  \ I could not help but be intrigued by your reference to a breakfast recipe which\
  \ involves, and I quote, \u201Cmore eggs than you can shake a stick at\u201D. How\
  \ many eggs is that?, I wondered. The only indication you give, and I quote again,\
  \ is \u201Ca goodly number of eggs\u201D. This is less than helpful. \u201CA goodly\
  \ number\u201D, in and of itself, is not a measurable quantity. A writer with more\
  \ concern for his or her readers would be precise in these matters, and tell us\
  \ plainly how many eggs we would have to assemble before we were no longer able\
  \ to shake a stick at them.\nBecause of your laxity, I was put in the position of\
  \ having to find out for myself. I went for a walk in the woods and came back carrying\
  \ a stout and sturdy stick. I think it was a branch from a hornbeam. It was a very\
  \ shakeable stick, as I ascertained by shaking it experimentally a few times while\
  \ still in the woods. Squirrels scattered as I shook it, and there was movement\
  \ in shrubbery as if a small woodland creature had been startled. Had I had with\
  \ me my net, I would have used it to entrap the creature, whatever it was, and then\
  \ rained blows upon it with the stick until 'twere dead, and taken it home with\
  \ me to boil for a snack, garnished perhaps with a tomato and some basil. As it\
  \ was, I was netless, so I returned home with just the stick.\nI then set to preparing\
  \ my test area. You know, I think, how thorough I am. I shoved the kitchen table\
  \ back against the kitchen wall, thus creating sufficient space for me to be able\
  \ to shake the stick without risking damage to my many and various kitchen appurtenances.\
  \ Next, I opened my refrigerator, and removed from it every single egg currently\
  \ in my possession, placing them, in their carton, on my countertop. I was somewhat\
  \ dismayed to note that I had only five eggs, from the carton's original complement\
  \ of six. My instinctive thought was that five was unlikely to be the \u201Cgoodly\
  \ number of eggs\u201D you prescribed. However, instinct is one thing, and empirical\
  \ evidence is another thing entirely. It was clear to me that the absolute minimum\
  \ possible indicated by \u201Ca goodly number of eggs\u201D was a simple plurality,\
  \ in other words, two eggs.\nBefore continuing, I fetched from a cubby a fresh ledger,\
  \ dozens of pages of creamy paper divided by faint blue lines into squares. In this,\
  \ I would tabulate my results, using several different coloured pencils, which I\
  \ duly sharpened with a pencil sharpener. I then removed two eggs from the carton\
  \ and placed them on the table, taking care to position them in such a way that\
  \ they would not roll off the tabletop and smash to squelchy ruin upon the floor\
  \ linoleum. I had already made certain the tabletop was level, using a Van Der Hoddle\
  \ Levelometer, a splendid device which I find far more effective than the common\
  \ spirit level, and which uses no spirits whatsoever.\nWith the two eggs in place\
  \ upon the table, as they would be were I to be embarking upon my breakfast preparation,\
  \ I shook the stick at them. I suffered no hindrance, and could have gone on shaking\
  \ the stick for hours upon end, had I been so minded. But I shook the stick only\
  \ for long enough to become convinced beyond any shade of doubt that two was not\
  \ the \u201Cgoodly number of eggs\u201D defined as \u201Cmore eggs than I could\
  \ shake a stick at\u201D. I noted the results in the ledger, painstakingly, and\
  \ then removed a third egg from the carton and placed it next to the original brace\
  \ of eggs on the table, proceeding to shake the stick once again.\nYou will, I suppose,\
  \ have worked out that soon enough I tried four, then five, eggs, with identical\
  \ outcomes. Pleased as I was with the severe beauty of the tabulation of results\
  \ in my ledger, I had now exhausted my supply of eggs. For a madcap moment, I considered\
  \ propping a mirror upon the kitchen table, thus doubling the visible number of\
  \ eggs, thinking by doing so I could somehow \u201Ctrick\u201D the stick. Two immediate\
  \ objections to such tomfoolery rapidly presented themselves. First, the positioning\
  \ of the mirror would be enormously complicated if I were to be able to present\
  \ the appearance of the intermediate egg numbers, from six through nine. Second,\
  \ the stick was just a stick, from a hornbeam, probably, and did not in itself have\
  \ sense perception, visual or otherwise. The impossibility of shaking a stick at\
  \ \u201Ca goodly number of eggs\u201D, whatever that number might be, was, I felt\
  \ sure, dependent not upon the stick itself, but on the quantity of eggs one was\
  \ attempting to shake it at. And in turn, that surely meant they had to be real\
  \ eggs, not mirror images nor any other eggs of illusion.\nNow, I was reluctant\
  \ to march off to my nearest egg shop to buy the extra eggs I would need. For one\
  \ thing, I had no idea how many eggs that might be. Also, what was I going to do\
  \ with them all when my experiment was done? One can only eat so many eggs before\
  \ becoming disgusted at the prospect of yet another egg-based meal, and it would\
  \ be a terrible sin, and a waste of money, to let them rot uneaten. I thought it\
  \ unlikely that the proprietor of the egg shop would be willing to allow me to return\
  \ any bought but unused eggs, for he is not the most amiable of shopkeepers. Indeed,\
  \ more than once I had had blazing arguments with him, and not always on the subject\
  \ of eggs.\nThen I recalled that there had been recent tidings from the farmyard\
  \ of Mad Old Farmer Frack. It was said that he was no longer devoting himself exclusively\
  \ to his bellowing cows, but had installed a hen coop, with hens in it, on the farm.\
  \ Where there's hens there's eggs, I said to myself, not wholly grammatically, but\
  \ memorably. I wondered if it was an old country saying. I resolved to ask Old Farmer\
  \ Frack if this were so, although the main business of the visit to him I now embarked\
  \ upon, without delay, was to borrow from him as many eggs as possible.\n\u201C\
  Hail to thee, Old Farmer Frack,\u201D I cried, within the hour, leaning against\
  \ his fence, \u201CI was wondering if it would be possible for me to borrow from\
  \ you as many eggs as possible? I will bring them back before nightfall.\u201D\n\
  The mad old farmer was standing in the middle of one of his fields, looking mad\
  \ and farmerly, doing something with a spade. When he heard me, he looked up, let\
  \ fall the spade, and came bounding over to me at inhuman speed. His eyes were bloodshot\
  \ and his hair was a tangle of filth.\n\u201CMy eggs are not for borrowing,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CUnder any circumstances. But for an old friend like you, Dr Pastry,\
  \ I might consider renting them out.\u201D\nAnd so we haggled. We had done so many\
  \ times before, over the years. The thing is, I have advanced haggling skills, whereas\
  \ Mad Old Farmer Frack is hopeless and inept in this area as in so many others.\
  \ Within a few minutes, I had him agreeing to let me take away hundreds upon hundreds\
  \ of eggs in return for a photocopy of my bus pass and a sprig o\u2019 myrtle. Of\
  \ course, I then had to scoot off to town to get the photocopy, and pop in to Myrtle\
  \ Sprigs R Us\xAE to get the sprig, but that was soon accomplished.\nWhen I returned\
  \ to the farm, Mad Old Farmer Frack was nowhere to be seen. I thought he might be\
  \ herding his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly, and went a-roaming\
  \ to see if I could spot him, and them. I found the cows, all of them, without their\
  \ farmer, standing around in a distant field beyond a drainage ditch, in the rain.\
  \ I trudged back through muck and puddles to the hen coop, and poked my head in\
  \ for a look-see. Lots and lots of hens, but no farmer, and, more to the point,\
  \ no eggs. A couple of the more savage hens made moves to attack me, but I remonstrated\
  \ with them in a sort of screechy hensprache I picked up from a hen person I met\
  \ on my travels, long ago, and they were immediately pacified, and not just pacified\
  \ but put into comas, from which they will only awake when next it is time for them\
  \ to lay an egg.\nThat done, I wandered aimlessly around the farm for a few hours\
  \ before giving up and going home, cursing Mad Old Farmer Frack and throwing pebbles\
  \ at crows in my annoyance. I unlatched the door of Pastry Cottage, and there, in\
  \ my kitchen, was the mad old farmer himself, waving a stick at the kitchen table\
  \ upon which teetered a gigantic pile of eggs. He looked around as I came in.\n\u201C\
  Ah, there you are, doctor,\u201D he said in his mad voice, \u201CI was so interested\
  \ in what you were telling me about your egg experiment during our haggling process,\
  \ I thought I'd carry on where you left off while you were fetching the agreed rental.\
  \ Speaking of which, do you have the photocopy of your bus pass and the sprig o\u2019\
  \ myrtle?\u201D\nNonplussed, I handed over the items without a word.\n\u201CSo far\
  \ I am up to a hundred and sixty-two eggs,\u201D said Old Farmer Frack, \u201CAnd\
  \ still nothing is impeding me from shaking the stick at them.\u201D\n\u201CHave\
  \ you been tabulating the results in the ledger?\u201D I asked, not unreasonably.\n\
  \u201COh\u2026 I forgot to do that bit,\u201D he said. At least he had the grace\
  \ to look shamefaced.\n\u201CThen we must begin again, from six upwards,\u201D I\
  \ said, \u201COtherwise the experiment will not have been conducted with sufficient\
  \ rigour.\u201D\n\u201CYes, yes, of course,\u201D said the mad old farmer, and I\
  \ was delighted to see that he immediately began to remove a hundred and fifty-six\
  \ eggs from the table, one by one, with surprisingly dainty movements, placing them\
  \ hither and thither about the kitchen wherever he was able to find space among\
  \ the many and various kitchen appurtenances I mentioned earlier, only a few of\
  \ which he had broken or dented when clumping about before suddenly remembering\
  \ his daintiness upon my arrival home.\nI have to say that tackling this as a two-person\
  \ job has been a marked improvement. I can concentrate on the majestic sweeping\
  \ penmanship of my ledger entries, while Mad Old Farmer Frack shakes the stick.\
  \ As a farmer, he is able to shake a stick with much more conviction than I can\
  \ muster, for of course he shakes a stick at something most days, whereas I only\
  \ rarely do so. We are taking it in turns to move the eggs from their temporary\
  \ storage places, one at a time, to join the eggs accumulated upon the table.\n\
  I am beginning to worry if the legs of my kitchen table will continue to support\
  \ the ever-increasing weight of eggs, and, as I write, have sent Mad Old Farmer\
  \ Frack off to fetch lengths of titanium cut to size, from Old Ma Purgative's Cut\
  \ To Size Titanium Reinforcement Rods Shoppe. I scribbled a note for him to take,\
  \ explaining to Old Ma Purgative that the table is currently supporting six hundred\
  \ and forty eggs, and asking that she supply titanium rods sturdy enough to support\
  \ twice that number. I added, of course, the relevant measurements, of both my table\
  \ legs and the approximate weight of eggs.\nFairly soon, however, we are going to\
  \ run out of eggs. Between us, I am sure we will work out how to get more, by hire\
  \ or theft or, as a last resort, cash purchase. Meanwhile, I am beginning to wonder\
  \ just how many eggs we will have piled on my reinforced table before I pause, coloured\
  \ pencil held steady over my ledger, and the time comes when Mad Old Farmer Frack\
  \ raises the hornbeam stick, to shake it yet again, and finds\u2014oh! sweet mystery\
  \ of life, or rather of egg-numbers\u2014that he is completely unable to do so.\
  \ When that time comes, Mr Key, I will write to you again, requesting further details\
  \ of your eggy breakfast recipe, which I have no doubt is both succulent and toothsome.\n\
  Yours waiting for Mad Old Farmer Frack to come crashing through the door,\nDr Ruth\
  \ Pastry\n[2010-07-10]"
