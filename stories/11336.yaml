  (see below), I noticed that the day before I had posted an extract from the magnificently-titled
  Withered Leaves From Memory''s Garland by Abigail Stanley Hanna (1857):

  Next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia Balcolm, with saddened expression of countenance
  and large deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression of melancholy
  in their glances than is usual to the merry age of childhood, and elicited your
  sympathy ere you knew her history. Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school
  by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly
  animated countenance, and carried into the school-room in the arms of her teacher,
  or some of the older scholars. And so she came, year after year, mingling with the
  merry group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heaped up earth covers her
  remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but
  hope she who was denied the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on angel''s
  wings. This dear child was obliged to crawl from place to place after her more favoured
  companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind her. But He who careth for
  us knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt His infinite wisdom.

  Would that Edward Gorey were with us still, to illustrate this tear-stained yet
  uplifting tale!
