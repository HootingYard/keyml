text: "Midway through our thrilling milk-based calendar, back in December, the Hooting\
  \ Yard website went kaput. Boffins worked tirelessly to repair whatever damage had\
  \ wrecked the innards, and I think it is now germ-free at last.\nUnfortunately,\
  \ at around the same time, Mr Key himself went kaput. There was general physical\
  \ debility, catastrophic problems with my eyesight\u2014still pitiable in spite\
  \ of ongoing injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs\u2014and, I am afraid\
  \ to say, a brain which came to resemble an empty vacant void or vacuum, in which\
  \ nothing stirred.\nIn the meantime, I celebrated my sixtieth birthday. I cannot\
  \ simply sprawl around peering vaguely at misty shimmerings and dribbling into a\
  \ tin cup. No! I must crack away at that damned keyboard again, however slowly and\
  \ fitfully, and try to unleash further sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose!\n\
  It's all a bit of a palaver, with ludicrously magnified screens and hit-and-miss\
  \ typing\u2014not to mention a compulsive desire to take a long snooze \u2013 but\
  \ I shall do my best to revivify your favourite website.\n[2019-04-23]"
