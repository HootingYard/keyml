text: 'A note arrives from my son Ed.

  Hey Pa, he writes, Did you realise that Not Hairy God is an anagram of Hooting Yard?
  I liked that, and I think you will too.

  And I do. I just wonder why I had not already been informed of this by R., the sort
  of anagrammatist-by-appointment to Hooting Yard. Those of you who keep a beady eye
  on the comments here will be familiar with R.''s stupendous work. Though R. remains
  resistant to being anagrammatised himself, for obvious reasons.
