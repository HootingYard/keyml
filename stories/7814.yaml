text: 'It''s pig time, at last, in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. Here is a picture
  of pigs doing what pigs do best. And let us not forget that if you gaze at these
  pigs for an hour or so, any mental or emotional turmoil buffeting your brain will
  be becalmed, for as we know, the contemplation of pigs in a pig sty is greatly soothing
  to the frantic.


  The snap is from the Animal Photos! website. I like the breezy gusto of that exclamation
  mark. Perhaps I should rename this site Hooting Yard!
