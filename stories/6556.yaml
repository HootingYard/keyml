text: "The house is frame, painted gray with green shutters. A wire fence runs round\
  \ the trim yard. The owner works as a draftsman in a downtown company, his wife\
  \ keeps house. They have lived in the neighbourhood for many years.\nIt is now dark,\
  \ a little after eight o\u2019 clock on a winter evening. The downstairs light is\
  \ on, the blinds are drawn. A man comes to the front door, raps lightly, and is\
  \ admitted. Soon another man, walking at a leisurely pace, rounds the corner and\
  \ enters. He has parked his car on another street.\nTen minutes pass. A third man\
  \ knocks. He has come by bus from downtown. To make certain nobody was following\
  \ him, he had ridden two stops past his correct destination, then walked back. Five\
  \ minutes later a fourth person, a woman in a dark coat, arrives. Everything is\
  \ quiet\_: no loud voices, no cars parked in front, no reasons for the neighbours\
  \ to suspect that a Communist party meeting is in progress.\nCommunist Party groups\
  \ like this are small, containing three, four, or five people\u2014a security precaution.\
  \ In that way fewer members know each other and detection is less likely. Meeting\
  \ places are frequently changed\_: this evening a private home, next time a public\
  \ library or an automobile. Members have been known to sit on park benches, in bus\
  \ terminals, even in hospital waiting rooms, hatching their plots in casual, conversational\
  \ tones\u2026\nNight after night, week after week, these men and women are plotting\
  \ against America, working out smears, seeking to discredit free government, and\
  \ planning for revolution. They form the base of a gigantic pyramid of treason,\
  \ stretching from the little gray house with green shutters to the towers of the\
  \ Kremlin.\nJ Edgar Hoover, Masters Of Deceit\_: The Story Of Communism In America\
