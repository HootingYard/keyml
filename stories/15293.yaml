text: "I stumbled upon Borp shortly after Himmelfarb. It was my good fortune to have\
  \ an emotional cushion. I had prayed for a pillow, but I got a cushion, so I could\
  \ not complain. There was old black and white footage of Lasse Viren on the box.\
  \ I thought I spotted Borp behind the box. This was not something I expected, and\
  \ it caused those tremors I thought had gone forever, like the Gurglings.\nThere\
  \ were Gurglings now, but they seemed to come from Borp. I was minded to take a\
  \ closer look, but a little voice in my head urged caution. Lasse Viren continued\
  \ to pound along the track, like a nonfiction Bobnit Tivol. I turned the sound down,\
  \ the better to hear Borp. There were definite Gurglings.\nInterrupted by a whistling\
  \ kettle, I decamped to the kitchen. Well, I ought properly say kitchenette, if\
  \ not kitchenettette. It was tiny. The kettle was correspondingly tiny too. But\
  \ the whistle! It was so loud that it drowned out the Gurglings. This was a small\
  \ mercy, and I was reluctant to remove the kettle from the hob. Had I tried to do\
  \ so, it would in any case have been held fast by the hobgoblins.\nI had been trying\
  \ to eradicate these from my kitchenettette since before Himmelfarb. There was a\
  \ spray, but it did little good. On the advice of Baines I fashioned a crucifix\
  \ from stalks of rhubarb and suspended it from a rafter with a chain. Nobody told\
  \ me Baines was a cretin.\nI whirled about in the kitchenettette trying to work\
  \ out what to do next. Outside, a crow landed on the lawn. Then another, and another.\
  \ Soon there were so many crows I could no longer see the grass. I felt sure this\
  \ had somehow been contrived by Borp, even if I had absolutely no idea how or why.\
  \ I tried to concentrate my mind on Himmelfarb.\nI summoned up what faint courage\
  \ I had and returned to the parlour to peek behind the box. Lasse Viren had vanished\
  \ from the box, to be replaced by Emil Zatopek, who was running in a different direction.\
  \ He looked like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt. I know that\
  \ is not an original observation, but it had never seemed more true. I gawped and\
  \ almost forgot about Borp. But then the sound of the Gurglings snapped me back\
  \ to the present. What use were athletics to me now?\nThen another question forced\
  \ itself into my brain. Why were the crows on the lawn silent? Should they not have\
  \ been cawing? That is two questions. It is no surprise that I dithered. I had dithered\
  \ on Himmelfarb, had I not?, and look where my dithering got me. Beset by kitchenettette\
  \ hobgoblins, and with only a useless spray and a rhubarb crucifix to counter them!\
  \ Baines would be made to pay, in his cretins\u2019 coinage.\nI was ready to throw\
  \ in the towel. That is of course a reference to the boxing ring. Lasse and Emil\
  \ were strangers to it, it was a different kind of box they were on. Was Borp behind\
  \ it? I had to know. But I also needed that towel, just in case. And I realised\
  \ I had clean forgotten where the airing cupboard was. I slumped in a chair and\
  \ picked up my album. It would have to serve as my emotional cushion for the time\
  \ being. I opened the album at a random page, and I gazed, and gazed and gazed,\
  \ for hours, until becalmed, at a photograph of Rasmus Tholstrup the cheesemaker,\
  \ with his wife and infant son.\n\n[2017-02-20]"
