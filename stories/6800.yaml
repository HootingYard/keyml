text: "Like Hudson, I wanted to gain possession of a man's head, to carry it across\
  \ the sea and drop it like an apple. And like Hudson, I wanted to do so without\
  \ violating any laws or doing harm to the man whose head it was. I was not so concerned\
  \ about the head having a set of unique and terrible teeth, in fact any head would\
  \ do. But the logistics were an absolute nightmare. In spite of a first class education\
  \ and the possession of an acute and incisive mind, I could not fathom how I might\
  \ get hold of someone's head, detached from the rest of their body, without either\
  \ breaking the law or doing them a mischief.\nWhen first this desire consumed me,\
  \ I did not bother myself with such niceties. I might be at an elegant and sophisticated\
  \ cocktail party, and I would take someone aside, steer them to a corner where we\
  \ would not be overheard, and say:\n\u201CCan I have your head? I want to take it\
  \ across the sea, and drop it like an apple of discord.\u201D\nThere would then\
  \ follow a discussion in the course of which the familiar objections, of criminal\
  \ intent and physical harm, would be raised. I blustered my way through these by\
  \ wearing a fixed grin and waving my arms a lot, but the difficulties would not\
  \ go away.\nI was unwilling to abandon the project entirely, however, so I sought\
  \ advice from a Jesuit priest. The Jesuits are rightly famed for their casuistry,\
  \ and I felt sure I would gain some useful tips. If anyone could pluck from the\
  \ air a method of gaining possession of a man's head, legally and harmlessly, Father\
  \ Ninian Tonguelash was that man!\nI found him, kneeling, deep in prayer, at the\
  \ altar rail in the Lady Chapel of a large and important cathedral. I knelt down\
  \ beside him and whispered:\n\u201CA man's head, Father. How might I gain possession\
  \ of one?\u201D\nHe turned to me, did something mysterious and significant with\
  \ his rosary beads, and asked me to explain further, so I did so.\n\u201CHmm,\u201D\
  \ he said, Jesuitically, when I had outlined my plans, \u201CIt is a pretty conundrum,\
  \ to be sure. Now, listen. Moored at the docks there is a Jesuit packet steamer,\
  \ the Ignatius Loyola. It is due to set sail across the sea tomorrow night. Meet\
  \ me at the dockside at ten o\u2019 clock. I will have something for you.\u201D\n\
  I thanked him, and left him to his prayers. I spent the next twenty-four hours sorting\
  \ out my affairs and packing a suitcase. At the appointed time, I made my way to\
  \ the docks. Father Tonguelash was already there, leaning against a wooden dockside\
  \ appurtenance smoking a high tar cigarette.\n\u201CHere,\u201D he said, handing\
  \ me a bag, \u201CTake this, with my blessing.\u201D\nIt was a burlap bag, and from\
  \ its size and shape and heft I knew at once that it contained a man's head. I was\
  \ about to fire a volley of questions at the Jesuit, but he held a nicotine-stained\
  \ finger to his lips and shooshed me.\n\u201CYou had better go aboard,\u201D he\
  \ said, \u201CThe Ignatius Loyola is about to chug out.\u201D\n\u201CThank you,\
  \ Father,\u201D I said, \u201CHow can I repay you?\u201D\n\u201CThere is no need,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CJust don't open the bag until you reach land.\u201D\nI promised\
  \ I would obey, as one should always obey a Jesuit, and I boarded the steamer, where\
  \ I was shown to my cabin. I placed the bag carefully in a cubby, then went back\
  \ up on deck to wave goodbye to Father Tonguelash and an odd assortment of dockyard\
  \ persons and seafarers\u2019 wives and Jesuits who had gathered to see us off.\n\
  That was a Thursday evening a quarter of a century ago. We are still at sea, plying\
  \ the oceans, the vast and illimitable oceans, far from any land. The burlap bag\
  \ is still there in the cubby of my cabin. I have not opened it.\n[2011-06-27]"
