text: "In the introduction to his Les Vies Imaginaires (1896)\u2014a profound influence\
  \ upon Borges\u2014Marcel Schwob writes:\nIf Boswell's book took up ten pages it\
  \ would be the book we were looking for. Doctor Johnson's common sense comprises\
  \ the vulgarest of commonplaces: expressed with the bizarre violence that Boswell\
  \ has the art to depict, it has a quality unique in this world. Only this ponderous\
  \ catalogue resembles the doctor's dictionary; from it one could extract a Scientia\
  \ Johnsoniana with an index. Boswell has not had the aesthetic courage to select.\n\
  (Translation by Iain White.)\nI was delighted to note, elsewhere in the introduction,\
  \ that Schwob makes mention of \u201Cthe conjectures to which Boswell abandons us\
  \ concerning the use Johnson made of the dried orange-peel he liked to keep in his\
  \ pockets\u201D\u2014as noted recently here.\nNB\_: Hooting Yard's in-house anagrammatist\
  \ R. will, I hope, get to work on the title of this postage.\n[2013-07-20]"
