text: "\u201CI am going to Switzerland,\u201D announced Dobson at breakfast one morning\
  \ in the 1950s.\n\u201COh?\u201D asked Marigold Chew, chewing on a sausage.\n\u201C\
  For some time now I have been keen to wear a Homburg hat on my head,\u201D said\
  \ the greatest out of print pamphleteer of the twentieth century, \u201CAnd I thought\
  \ there would be no better place to obtain the hat than in Homburg itself, which\
  \ I have learned is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. So that is where\
  \ I shall go, as soon as I have managed to complete the extremely intricate lacing\
  \ up of these Guatemalan traffic policeman's boots.\u201D\n\u201CBefore you go,\u201D\
  \ said Marigold Chew, \u201CIt might be helpful for you to know that the Homburg\
  \ hat originated not in the Swiss Homburg of which you speak, but in Bad Homburg\
  \ vor der H\xF6he\_in the Hochtaunuskreis district of Hesse in Germany. King Edward\
  \ VII came back from a jaunt there sporting the hat, and made it popular.\u201D\n\
  But Dobson was so intent on the complicated lacing of his boots that he did not\
  \ listen to his inamorata, and before she could stop him he had donned his long\
  \ Tzipi Gulbenkian overcoat and crashed out of the door into the autumnal 1950s\
  \ downpour.\nWhen, later, much later, he arrived in the Swiss municipality of Homburg,\
  \ it did not take him long to discover he was in the wrong Homburg. The conversation\
  \ he had with the proprietor of a Swiss hat shop has not been recorded, but we do\
  \ know that Dobson blew a gasket and spent several hours in the custody of Homburg\
  \ law enforcement officers. Released after promising that he would leave the town\
  \ immediately and never, ever return, Dobson headed for Bad Homburg vor der H\xF6\
  he. Having only enough cash to buy a hat, he had to walk. It was raining in both\
  \ Switzerland and Germany at that time, and as he trudged north, for two hundred\
  \ and forty miles, his temper grew ever fouler.\nBy the time he arrived at the home\
  \ of the hat he was exhausted and filthy and sopping wet. He slumped on a municipal\
  \ bench and scribbled some notes in his jotter, notes which later formed the basis\
  \ of his magnificent pamphlet Thoughts Upon A Rain-soaked Trudge From Homburg To\
  \ Homburg (out of print). They were not pretty thoughts. A gaggle of Bad Homburg\
  \ tots were out on an instructional walk with their governess, and when they stopped\
  \ to stare at the bedraggled pamphleteer he threw pebbles at them. This led to an\
  \ altercation with the tots and their governess and several German law enforcement\
  \ officers, from which Dobson only managed to extricate himself by promising to\
  \ write a pamphlet in praise of Bad Homburg tots and governesses and law enforcement\
  \ officers. No trace of such a work has ever been found among his papers, but diligent\
  \ Dobsonists continue to rummage. Perhaps one day it will be unearthed.\nQuenching\
  \ his thirst with water from a puddle\u2014into which he had earlier inadvertently\
  \ sploshed up to his ankles\u2014Dobson set off in search of a hat shop. He soon\
  \ found one, and managed to buy a hat without causing a rumpus. He was, for a few\
  \ moments, happy.\n\u201CI cannot wait to get home!\u201D he said to himself, \u201C\
  Marigold Chew will be resmitten, all over again, when she sees me sporting my Homburg\
  \ hat on my head!\u201D\nThe idyll did not last. Barely had the pamphleteer set\
  \ foot outside the hat shop than he was accosted by a German person wearing some\
  \ kind of uniform, who jabbed him on the shoulder and shouted.\n\u201CYour trouser\
  \ cuffs are dirty and your shoes are laced up wrong. You'd better take off your\
  \ Homburg, \u2018cos your overcoat is too long.\u201D\n\u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D\
  \ spluttered Dobson. The man repeated himself word for word.\n\u201CNow look here,\u201D\
  \ said the pamphleteer, \u201CFirst, my trouser cuffs are only dirty because I have\
  \ walked two hundred and forty miles to get here, and stepped in many a puddle along\
  \ the way. Second, these are not shoes but boots, specifically Guatemalan traffic\
  \ policeman's boots. The lacing of them is an extremely intricate business, and\
  \ I would challenge anybody to lace them up correctly at the first attempt. Third,\
  \ this overcoat is not too long. Yes, it is long, for it is of the stylish cut designed\
  \ by tiptop overcoat designer Tzipi Gulbenkian. Ladies have been known to swoon\
  \ at the sight of its decisive and urgent swish as I sashay along the boulevards\
  \ engarbed in it. And no, I will not remove my brand new Homburg hat, nor doff it,\
  \ to you or to any other man.\u201D\n\u201CThen I must place you under immediate\
  \ arrest,\u201D said his accoster.\n\u201CAnd who might you be, and what agency\
  \ does that uniform signify?\u201D asked Dobson.\n\u201CI am Obergruppengit Von\
  \ H\xF6henzollernschweswigstockhausenstimmung of the Bad Homburg vor der H\xF6he\_\
  Sartorial Standards Enforcement Police,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd if you do not come\
  \ quietly I will thump you several times with unimaginable brutality until you sob\
  \ for your mama.\u201D\nDobson was not a physical coward, but nor was he a fool.\n\
  \u201CWhat if I take my hat off and put it in a carrier bag until I leave your delightful\
  \ spa town with its delightful tots and delightful governesses and delightful law\
  \ enforcement officers?\u201D he whimpered.\n\u201CThat will be acceptable, said\
  \ the Obergruppengit.\nSo Dobson put his Homburg hat in a carrier bag, and the rain\
  \ poured down upon his bare unhatted bonce. As he did so, the town clock in the\
  \ Bad Homburg market square stood waiting for the hour, when its hands they both\
  \ turned backwards, and on meeting they devoured both themselves and also any fool\
  \ who dared to tell the time. As we have learned, Dobson was not a fool. He trudged,\
  \ in the rain, out of Bad Homburg vor der H\xF6he, headed for home. And the sun\
  \ and moon shattered, and the signposts ceased to sign.\n[2012-11-09]"
