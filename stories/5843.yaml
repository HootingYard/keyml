  \ decadence\u201D of Abney Park Cemetery, prompting Nige to recall a fine gravestone\
  \ epitaph in his local churchyard. Which in turn prompts me to recall one of my\
  \ own favourite epitaphs, that of the quack doctor Lionel Lockyer (1600\u20131672),\
  \ whose miracle pills included sunbeams among their ingredients, in Southwark Cathedral:\n\
  Here Lockyer; lies interr'd enough; his name\nSpeakes one hath few competitors in\
  \ fame;\nA name soe Great, soe Generall't may scorne\nInscriptions whch doe vulgar\
  \ tombs adorne.\nA diminution 'tis to write in verse\nHis eulogies whch most mens\
  \ mouths rehearse.\nHis virtues and his PILLS are soe well known..\nThat envy can't\
  \ confine them vnder stone.\nBut they'll survive his dust and not expire\nTill all\
  \ things else at th'universall fire.\nThis verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him\
  \ safe\nTo future times without an Epitaph\n\nPhoto courtesy of Nick Garrod\n[2011-01-12]"
