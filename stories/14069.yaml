text: "\nIn my cupboard in yesterday's Dabbler I resurrected some prose from the last\
  \ century. The twelve potted biographies you will find there served originally as\
  \ the texts accompanying illustrations for the 1993 Hooting Yard Calendar, entitled\
  \ The Golden Age Of Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre. (One of the illustrations\
  \ is reproduced for The Dabbler.)\nI revisited some even earlier prose in a dream\
  \ last night. When I was about fifteen years old I wrote a dreadful surrealist(ish)\
  \ play-of-sorts called The Shepherd Of Amsterdam. The text no longer survives, long\
  \ ago consumed by fire or eaten by worms. Last night it returned to haunt me in\
  \ my sleep. I was in charge of putting on a stage production of the work, due to\
  \ begin in fifteen minutes in spite of the fact that no rehearsals had taken place\
  \ and the actors were wholly unfamiliar with the play. Indeed, there was only the\
  \ single copy of the text in my possession, which I belatedly thought to photocopy.\
  \ I was heading to the library for that purpose when I was told that the soundtrack\
  \ CD of the play\u2014produced by a walrus-moustachioed impresario who, I was assured,\
  \ was \u201Ca big fan of Hooting Yard\u201D\u2014featuring music by Verdi and Monteverdi,\
  \ was ready, awaiting only the addition of the actors performing the words.\nThen\
  \ I woke up.\n[2015-07-04]"
