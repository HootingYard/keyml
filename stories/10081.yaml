text: "For today's sermon I take as my text some pairs of words from the Grauniad\
  \ cryptic crossword, No. 25,733, set by Chifonie. There we will find, when we have\
  \ solved the puzzle, NORMAL BUTCHERS (15 across and 18 across), OMINOUS STORAGE\
  \ (16 down and 1 down), and DERANGED PENANCE (12 across and 7 down).\nWe may imagine,\
  \ at the outset, a NORMAL BUTCHER. He is normal insofar as he wears standard butchers\u2019\
  \ apparel, makes use of conventional butchers\u2019 knives and cleavers and slicers\
  \ and mincers, and sells only those cuts of meat one is likely to find in any butchers\u2019\
  \ shop throughout this land. He even has a normal butchery name, something like\
  \ Mister Brinks or Mister Greaves. If you were to pass his shop, on a normal street\
  \ in a line of shops including a greengrocers\u2019, a haberdashery, a newsagent\
  \ and a bakery, you would not feel a shudder of Lovecraftian terror. If, instead\
  \ of passing by, you popped in, to make purchase of sausages, say, the transaction\
  \ would be conducted absolutely normally, and you would take the sausages home and\
  \ cook them and chew them and swallow them and you would lean back in your chair\
  \ and pat your sated tum and there would be no catastrophic consequences whatsoever.\
  \ All is normal, you would think, in the world of that butcher.\nBut there is normal\
  \ and there is outwardly normal, and they are very different things. Mister Grimes\
  \ the butcher may look and act as normally as one expects a butcher to look and\
  \ act, but what his customers perceive may be a mere carapace, concealing a monstrous\
  \ and abnormal inner maelstrom of seething chaos. It may indeed be a studied normality,\
  \ honed and perfected over many years, the better to hide the awful reality.\nLet\
  \ us ask, does Mister Jarvis ever allow anybody into the back room of his butchers\u2019\
  \ shop? Why is it always locked, and locked doubly or trebly, with padlocks and\
  \ chains? Does he have the radio in his shop tuned to Butchers\u2019 Playtime airing\
  \ Xavier Cugat number after Xavier Cugat number at a loud volume simply to muffle\
  \ the eerie and spine-tingling noises otherwise to be heard from that locked back\
  \ room? What on earth does he keep in there, and is it alive?\nWe may be unable\
  \ to provide answers to those questions, but we can say that the back room is used\
  \ for OMINOUS STORAGE. There is something stored in there, and it is ominous. And\
  \ if we study Mister Smethwick's countenance carefully, we might notice that, as\
  \ he serves us our sausages, wrapping them in greaseproof butchers\u2019 paper and\
  \ tying the package with butchers\u2019 string, his eyes dart occasionally towards\
  \ that locked door, and for all his normality there is in those eyes an expression\
  \ of mad intensity. Whether it be fear or murderousness is harder to ascertain.\
  \ We are likely to dismiss it as a trait or a tic, that darting, insufficient in\
  \ itself to convince us that the butcher is in any way abnormal. In any case, as\
  \ we wait to be handed our sausages, we are clicking our fingers to the catchy beat\
  \ of Xavier Cugat. It serves not only to drown out the gruesome noises from the\
  \ back room, but to distract us from wondering too deeply about the butcher's darting\
  \ eyes.\nThere is, to be sure, ominous potential in any storage facility, be it\
  \ a butcher's back room or an extensive warehouse surrounded by an electrified fence\
  \ in the desert. Unless we personally go a-rummaging through all the boxes and crates\
  \ and cartons and vats and canisters and what have you, neatly arranged in rows\
  \ upon shelving units or piled up higgledy-piggledy or in any number of other dispositions,\
  \ we can never be certain what is contained therein. That sense of doubt is not\
  \ always ominous, but it can be. Just as we would jump out of our skin if we spotted\
  \ a slithering vegetable tendril tapering to a palpitating sucker emerging from\
  \ a crate in a storage shed, so we would shudder if, undistracted by the butcher's\
  \ skilful sausage-wrapping and the Xavier Cugat music, we noted that the locked\
  \ door of the back room was shaking on its hinges, as if something within were trying\
  \ to break its way out and crash through into the normal world.\nAnd this explains\
  \ why, at nightfall, when the butcher's shop is closed and the shutters are down,\
  \ we will find Mister Perkins sprawled on the bare stone floor of his cellar, abasing\
  \ himself in an act of DERANGED PENANCE. He is gibbering words seldom encountered\
  \ outside the pages of an H. P. Lovecraft story. Words? Perhaps it would be better\
  \ to say hideous strangulated cries. These cries, these gibberings, are addressed\
  \ to a mud idol standing on a slab. There are nails driven into the idol, and two\
  \ glistening gemstones embedded in its head, to serve as eyes. And though it is\
  \ mere mud and metal and jewel, all inanimate, the butcher knows in the deepest\
  \ core of his being that those eyes can see him. They glare and sparkle and bore\
  \ into him, and he grovels ever more abjectly on the floor, doing his deranged penance\
  \ to his god.\nIf we were to understand his hellish gibbering, we would learn that\
  \ Mister Wilkins is pleading with the mud idol to forgive him for what he has done.\
  \ And what has he done? What was it he did, those many years ago, that forced him\
  \ to avert suspicion by seeming so normal, that forced him to lock and lock again\
  \ and lock yet again the door to his back room? What thing has he kept trapped in\
  \ there? Only the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred could tell us that.\nAnd as the night\
  \ soil man roves the streets of the town under fierce moonlight, he makes his way\
  \ down the alley behind the butcher's shop, and hears, from within, oozing and chthonic,\
  \ the repeated sound \u201CGlubb\u2026 Glubb\u2026 Glubb\u2026\u201D\n[2012-09-05]"
