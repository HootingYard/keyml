text: "At the beginning of the year, you may recall, in homage to George Orwell's\
  \ egg-counting mania, I began a daily squirrel count. Alas, I lack the single-minded\
  \ diligence necessary for so useful a pastime, and I am afraid the count petered\
  \ out on, er, the second of January.\nI mention this solely as a pretext to draw\
  \ to your attention this squirrel.\nIt is said somewhere, possibly by Dobson, that\
  \ every fictional hero has an antipole, an eerie opposite that features in an\u2014\
  almost certainly unwritten\u2014mirror of the original work. (If it was Dobson,\
  \ it is a shame he never developed this thesis into an entire pamphlet.) I think\
  \ we can safely say that what we have here is the antipole of Unconscious Squirrel!,\
  \ the unconscious squirrel.\n[2009-08-14]"
