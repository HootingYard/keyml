text: "There was a pig. It was in the cellar. I was listening to a record by Paul\
  \ Weller. He sang \u201CTales From The Riverbank\u201D. I looked at the pig and\
  \ my heart sank. I looked at the pig and our eyes met, The Jam song deafening on\
  \ my Dansette, a very old record player if truth be told. The cellar was gloomy\
  \ and damp and cold. So I lifted the needle off of the disc, I filed the record\
  \ back under Misc., and I unlocked the door with a big iron key, and I climbed up\
  \ the stairs with the pig beside me, and we ran outside into the battering sun,\
  \ and down to the riverbank where we had fun, the pig and me paddling, splashing\
  \ about, with voles and otters. Then I heard a shout. A fellow was waving from the\
  \ opposite bank. At first I thought he was some kind of crank. But it was Paul Weller,\
  \ to my amaze, dressed as he was in his Style Council days. Now the pig liked The\
  \ Jam, it was that kind of pig. It had never gone near a Style Council gig. It grunted\
  \ and trotted off back to the cellar. So was my pig/river idyll marred by Paul Weller.\n\
