text: "In spending the weekend just gone in Amsterdam, I was of course following in\
  \ the footsteps of the twentieth century's most illustrious out of print pamphleteer.\
  \ But whereas I went to the Dutch capital in the cause of art, Dobson's visit was\
  \ occasioned by a challenge. Let me tell you all about it.\nIt so happened that\
  \ one wet and windy morning in the 1950s the pamphleteer was on his usual trudge\
  \ along the towpath of the old canal, when a man sprang out at him from behind a\
  \ splurge of cuckoopint. The man was rotund and diminutive and dressed all in green,\
  \ with a little green pointy hat. He looked like a figure from a fairy tale, and\
  \ though his name was not Rumpelstiltskin, it was similar, with the same number\
  \ of syllables but a slightly different combination of vowels and consonants.\n\
  Such was the suddenness of the strange little man's springing that Dobson was disconcerted,\
  \ and would have toppled over, sploshing into the canal, had he not had the presence\
  \ of mind to deploy a Goon Fang technique he had recently mastered. In this exercise\
  \ of the ancient mystic art, one is able to fix one's feet to the ground, as if\
  \ magnetically, for just long enough to avoid topplement. Dobson swayed slightly.\n\
  \u201CDrat and heaven's hounds a-gubbins!\u201D screeched the little fellow dressed\
  \ in green, \u201CYou were meant to topple over into the canal with a splosh that\
  \ would cause me much mirth!\u201D\n\u201CThen you are confounded!\u201D, shouted\
  \ Dobson.\n\u201CWhat I do,\u201D said the little man, \u201CIs to present those\
  \ who confound me with a challenge. I challenge you to go to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands,\
  \ a city with a magnificent network of seventeenth century canals, and I further\
  \ challenge you to walk alongside each and every canal in Amsterdam, from end to\
  \ end, on both banks, trudging along back and forth, and to complete the task without\
  \ once toppling into one or other of the canals. Do you accept my challenge?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI do,\u201D said Dobson immediately, without thinking. But he was not being\
  \ unduly impetuous. He realised that a trip to Amsterdam could provide the opportunity\
  \ for important research,\n\u201CIt so happens,\u201D he explained, \u201CThat I\
  \ am currently at work on a pamphlet devoted to the study of mariners with an exclusively\
  \ fish-based diet. I have heard that in the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors\
  \ all meet, there's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails, and he'll show\
  \ you his teeth that have rotted too soon, that can haul up the sails, that can\
  \ swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook, with his arms open wide \u2018Hey,\
  \ bring me more fish, throw it down by my side\u2019 and he wants so to belch, but\
  \ he's too full to try, so he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly, in the\
  \ port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam. I would like to meet that sailor,\
  \ and interrogate him on his diet.\u201D\n\u201CI have often wondered,\u201D said\
  \ the little man dressed all in green, \u201CIf the port of Amsterdam is the port\
  \ to which Emily Dickinson was referring in that magnificently sensual poem \u2018\
  Wild Nights!\u2019, where she writes Futile\u2014the winds\u2014To a Heart in port\u2014\
  Done with the Compass\u2014Done with the Chart!\u201D\n\u201CPerhaps that is something\
  \ else I can research while I am there,\u201D said Dobson.\nThe little man chuckled\
  \ horribly.\n\u201CYou will be too busy wringing out your clothing, sopping wet\
  \ from repeated topplings into one canal after another,\u201D he said.\n\u201CWe\
  \ shall see,\u201D said the pamphleteer.\n\u201CMeet me again by this splurge of\
  \ cuckoopint in a week's time,\u201D said the little man, \u201CWhile you are in\
  \ Amsterdam I am going to sit in my Reichian orgone accumulator and recite \u2018\
  Wild Nights!\u2019 over and over again. So impassioned is the poem that I hardly\
  \ dare think to what explosive pitch the orgone energy levels will rise!\u201D\n\
  It was Dobson's turn to laugh.\n\u201CReichian methods would not stop me from toppling\
  \ into the many canals of the port of Amsterdam,\u201D he said, \u201CBut I have\
  \ mastered the magnetic bootsole technique of Goon Fang, and will practise it with\
  \ great assiduousness!\u201D\nA week later, on a wet and windy morning, Dobson returned\
  \ to the splurge of cuckoopint on the towpath of the old canal. But of the strange\
  \ little man dressed all in green there was no sign. It was not until many weeks\
  \ had passed that the pamphleteer learned, from an article in The Emily Dickinson\
  \ Orgone Energy Digest (Vol XXI, No. 9) that a lethal concentration of what Wilhelm\
  \ Reich called DOR, or \u201Cdeadly orgone\u201D, had caused a massive explosion\
  \ in the vicinity of the canal, at precisely the time Dobson was in Amsterdam.\n\
  Although he never completed his work on mariners with exclusive fish diets, Dobson\
  \ did write a pamphlet entitled On Not Toppling Into Any Of The Many Canals Of Amsterdam\
  \ (out of print).\nIn spite of my mastery of Goon Fang, he wrote, I took the extra\
  \ precaution of smearing the soles of my Ruritanian Bellringer's boots with an extremely\
  \ viscous substance composed of glue and egg yolk and sand and gum and gunk and\
  \ goo and powerful magnets, retailed under the trade name Gosh! It's Very Sticky!\
  \ \xAE. This proved a boon, for though no funny little men dressed all in green\
  \ with green pointy hats sprang out at me as I trudged alongside each and every\
  \ canal in Amsterdam, I was not prepared for the dazzling number of Dutch cyclists\
  \ whizzing at high speed along those very same paths. I would certainly have toppled\
  \ into canal after canal after canal had my boots not been riveted to the ground.\n\
  I count myself fortunate that I had read a rare copy of this pamphlet before my\
  \ own weekend in Amsterdam. Had I not, I feel sure I too, surprised by cyclists,\
  \ would have toppled into many canals, and returned home sopping wet. It just goes\
  \ to show how valuable it can be to gain a familiarity with Dobson's more obscure\
  \ works.\nI did not, incidentally, seek out the sailor who eats only fish heads\
  \ and tails. Perhaps I should have.\n[2013-04-16]"
