text: "This is probably the most accurate observation of a cat in world literature:\n\
  Victor was a blue-point Siamese, a neutered tom-cat now in the third year of his\
  \ age. He entered, as usual, in vague semi-flight, as from something that was probably\
  \ not a menace, but which it was as well to be on the safe side about. Becoming\
  \ aware of me, he approached, again as usual, with an air of uncertainty not so\
  \ much about who I was as about what I was, and of keeping a very open mind on the\
  \ range of possible answers. Was I potassium nitrate, or next October twelvemonth,\
  \ or Christianity, or a chess problem\u2014perhaps involving a variation on the\
  \ Falkbeer counter-gambit? When he reached me, he gave up the problem and toppled\
  \ on to my feet like an elephant pierced by a bullet in some vital spot. Victor\
  \ was, among other things, the reason why no dogs were allowed at the Green Man.\
  \ The effort of categorizing them might have proved too much for him.\nfrom The\
  \ Green Man by Kingsley Amis (1969)\n[2014-06-06]"
