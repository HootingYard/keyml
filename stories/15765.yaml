text: "\nI was discussing the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen with the ghost of his\
  \ first wife, Doris.\n\u201CIs it true\u201D I asked, \u201CThat Stockhausen was\
  \ covertly funded by the CIA in an attempt to demoralise German culture after the\
  \ Second World War?\u201D\nDoris was one of those mute ghosts we've been hearing\
  \ so much about lately but I hoped she would either nod or shake her head in reply.\
  \ But her phantom head remained motionless atop her phantom neck, jutting at a disconcerting\
  \ angle from between her phantom shoulders, draped in a shawl of surpassing loveliness\
  \ which was all too real, as I knew because I had touched it, when gently pressing\
  \ her down into her chair.\nWell, not her chair, but a chair, the chair into which\
  \ I press all my ghostly visitors. Unless you get them firmly nestled, they have\
  \ a tendency to float and flit about the room, and even to splay themselves across\
  \ the ceiling. Not all ghosts come when I summon them, but Doris did. A few seconds\
  \ after my ear-splitting incantation, there was a faint tapping at my door. I opened\
  \ it, and there, already, was the ghost of Doris Stockhausen. She handed over my\
  \ fifty-pfennig fee, in cash that was pleasingly of this too too solid world\u2014\
  I checked\u2014and allowed herself to be ushered in, and settled in the chair.\n\
  But I had not reckoned on her being a mute ghost. She sat across from me, fixing\
  \ me with her baleful countenance, silent as the grave from which I had summoned\
  \ her. With no prospect of the conversation I had so looked forward to, I went to\
  \ rummage among my cassettes until I found the tape of her ex-husband's Stimmung.\
  \ I wondered if, hearing it again after all these years, Doris might be in some\
  \ measure animated.\nWhen I returned to the room, Doris had escaped her chair and\
  \ was splayed across the ceiling. The surpassingly lovely shawl was hanging from\
  \ her phantom shoulders, so I gave it a tug, hoping to dislodge her. And indeed,\
  \ she lost contact with the ceiling, hovering in mid-air for a moment before darting\
  \ this way and that, finally settling atop a toffee cable. Oops, I mean a coffee\
  \ table. Using thumb-tacks, I secured the shawl to the table, holding Doris in place.\
  \ The table was one of those fashionably distressed coffee tables, so the addition\
  \ of a dozen tack-pricks would only add to its faux dilapidation.\nThere was every\
  \ possibility that the ghost of Doris could slip or waft from beneath the shawl\
  \ and go skittering about. I slotted the cassette into the cassette player, pressed\
  \ \u201CPlay\u201D, and cranked up the volume.\n\u201CLet us listen to Stimmung,\
  \ Frau Stockhausen!\u201D I cried, with perhaps an excess of jollity.\nThe tape\
  \ hissed, and then the room was filled with the sound of a German man moaning melodiouslyish.\
  \ Startled, I saw Doris suddenly clap her ghostly hands over her ghostly ears. Then\
  \ she began to vibrate, horribly. I turned the music off, but it was too late. With\
  \ a whoosh!, Doris shot up to the ceiling, taking the surpassingly lovely shawl\
  \ and the coffee table with her.\nTry as I might, I could not coax her down. Not\
  \ only was I unable to use my coffee table to display my coffee table books, of\
  \ which I owned oodles, but soon enough Doris outstayed her allotted time in the\
  \ realm of the living afforded by the fifty-pfennig fee. Six weeks later she was\
  \ still there, clinging to my ceiling, the shawl and table swinging gently beneath\
  \ her in time with her ghostly panting. I had not realised how violently ghosts\
  \ pant, particularly the mute ones.\nAt my wits\u2019 end, I consulted a local spirit\
  \ medium who specialised in the demoralisation of German culture in the aftermath\
  \ of World War Two. He was a rather curious fellow. His yellow skin scarcely covered\
  \ the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and\
  \ flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a\
  \ more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour\
  \ as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and\
  \ his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human\
  \ expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\n\u201CHand. Me. That.\
  \ Cassette. Player.\u201D he boomed, standing directly beneath the ghost of Doris\
  \ and the shawl and the coffee table.\nI did his bidding, and he took from his pocket\
  \ a battered cassette tape. I shall never forget what happened next. He plopped\
  \ the cassette into the machine, pressed \u201CPlay\u201D, and cranked up the volume.\
  \ There was the familiar hiss, and then the sound of a capella German voices warbling\
  \ melodiously, with no ish about it, the first of the Choruses For Doris, by Doris\u2019\
  \ ex-husband Karlheinz Stockhausen.\nThe spirit medium stepped\u2014or rather, lumbered\
  \ grotesquely\u2014to one side, and the ghost of Doris let go of the ceiling and\
  \ wafted elegantly down, shawl and coffee table and all, the table landing with\
  \ a slight bump on the floor. As the chorus continued, the medium removed the thumb-tacks\
  \ one by one. The ghost of Doris rose slghtly, hovering just above the coffee table,\
  \ shimmered for a few seconds, and then seemed to dissolve before my eyes. Weirdly,\
  \ that indubitably real unghostly shawl, of surpassing loveliness, dissolved with\
  \ her. Then, even more weirdly, the spirit medium dissolved too, taking a handful\
  \ of my thumb-tacks with him into ethereal realms beyond my puny understanding.\n\
  I was alone in my room, listening to the Choruses For Doris, and thinking to myself\
  \ that postwar German culture had not, after all, been demoralised, in spite of\
  \ the alleged efforts of the CIA.\n[2017-10-07]"
