  is likely, not to say inevitable, that tomorrow I shall snap my fingers again and,
  foof-la!, abolish the Hooting Yard Friday Quiz, so make the most of it while you
  have the chance.)

  This week''s challenge is to identify correctly the forty-seven fictional characters
  listed yesterday in the piece Unhinged By Cream Crackers. You need to provide the
  title of the work, be it a novel or a play or a film or what have you, where the
  character first appeared.

  The first person to post a full and correct list in the Comments will win a modest
  prize. I do not yet know what it will be, but I will think of something, and it
  will not be a world cruise aboard the HMS Corrugated Cardboard.
