text: "\nDennis Beerpint's majestic poem Two Monks Took The Blood Of A Duck is the\
  \ subject of Key's Cupboard in The Dabbler this week. Elderly Hooting Yard readers\
  \ will know that the title is taken from Alfred Wesley Wishart's A Short History\
  \ Of Monks And Monasteries (1900), wherein we also learn\u2014in the same brief\
  \ quotation\u2014that St Ursula had three heads. She is one of the very few Catholic\
  \ saints to have more than\_ one head, a fact which becomes blindingly clear if\
  \ you tot up the number of saints and then count the number of saints\u2019 heads.\
  \ The two numbers almost match, but however many times you do the calculation you\
  \ will always find slightly more saints\u2019 heads than saints.\nIn their girlhood,\
  \ both of my sisters attended an Ursuline Convent School, and I asked them if the\
  \ three-headed nature of their dedicatory saint had any decisive influence on the\
  \ school's ethos.\n\u201CNo,\u201D they said, \u201CDon't be such a nitwit.\u201D\
  \nMy sisters have one head each.\n[2011-05-27]"
