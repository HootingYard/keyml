  Dear Mr Key, writes Dimity Cashew, You seem to think that all your devotees belong
  to Hooting Yard Reading Groups, groups which meet to discuss your works long into
  the night, until one among them remarks how late it is, how late, and the cows come
  home. Well, I for one am a member of no such group, though I am a loyal devotee
  who has been reading your mighty prose since time immemorial, or thereabouts. I
  devour your outpourings daily, reading the postages on my comp-yoo-dah, or via the
  special app on my iHoot, or by poring over your splendid paperback books. Sometimes
  I even listen to the podcasts, where I might be fortunate enough to hear some of
  your stories in between all that coughing and spluttering. The point is that, however
  I choose to ingest your blatherings, I do so alone, and I never discuss the experience
  with another living soul, not even with Little Severin, my pet badger. (Actually,
  I must confess that I did once express an opinion on one of your pieces to Little
  Severin, but being a badger, he neither comprehends nor is able to imitate human
  speech, so that was something of a fool''s errand on my part. It is true that he
  is a mystic badger, but his mysticism is confined to prognostications of the future
  derived from scrubbling about in undergrowth, akin to the way a haruspex would read
  the hot and bloody entrails of a recently slaughtered poultry bird.) I cannot begin
  to imagine what it would be like to sit around with a groupuscule of other Hooting
  Yard readers, babbling about your prose off the tops of our heads. The thought had
  never even occurred to me. Now it has, I am quite intrigued. Do you have any tips
  on how I might set about organising such a group, including some guidance on what
  manner of refreshments I ought to make available? Please note that I am currently
  residing on a remote and barren atoll, plopped somewhere in the middle of a wild
  and wanton sea, with only a ragged tarpaulin for shelter, and Little Severin for
  company.

  I am pleased to inform Ms Cashew that I have made special arrangements for a jet
  aircraft to zoom over her atoll later in the week, spelling out clear and comprehensive
  instructions for the setting up of a Hooting Yard Reading Group by means of ingeniously-patterned
  vapour trails emblazoned across the blue, blue, cloudless sky.
