text: "Trebizondo Culpeper snorted. His was a mighty snort, caused on this occasion\
  \ by his reading, in the Standard, of the well-known science lecturer Dr. J. Q.\
  \ Rumball's theory that the origin of the potato disorder was of an electrical nature.\n\
  Trebizondo Culpeper gathered about him a buzz of acolytes, keen young Trebizondo\
  \ Culpeperists with bright eyes and intriguingly windswept hairstyles.\n\u201CHark!\u201D\
  \ boomed Trebizondo Culpeper, waving the newspaper aloft, \u201CRumball is spouting\
  \ forth his electrical theory of the origin of the potato disorder. Never has it\
  \ been clearer to me that it is wholly and utterly a matter of gas! Fan out, now,\
  \ youngsters, fan out and spread the word!\u201D\nAnd so the Trebizondo Culpeperists\
  \ went each to his own cubicle, and took up his stylus, and scraped on flat sheets\
  \ of gleaming Trebizondoculpeperite\u2122 screeds to the Standard, and to other\
  \ newspapers, and to magazines and journals and important institutions, discrediting\
  \ Rumball and his theory and making the case for a gas origin of the potato disorder.\n\
  In his eyrie, Trebizondo Culpeper beamed with glee. He ground the Standard under\
  \ his boot, and he poked pins into a waxen doll of Dr. J. Q. Rumball, and he unscrewed\
  \ the nozzle on his canister, and put the siphon to his plumpish bulbous lips, and\
  \ he took a deep, deep draught of the gas.\nAnd when he exhaled, all about him shrivelled\
  \ and withered and died. He clapped his hands, and called to an acolyte to bring\
  \ him a platter of newly disordered potatoes.\n[2009-07-20]"
