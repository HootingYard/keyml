text: "\u201CYou must be that fire-priestess everyone is talking about.\u201D\nThis\
  \ is a line from Game Of Thrones that I have been hoping to use in everyday conversation.\
  \ I could, of course, just say it next time I find myself leaning insouciantly against\
  \ a mantelpiece at a swish cocktail party, to any woman within earshot, but even\
  \ I realise how foolish that would be. No, what I need to do is to find the right\
  \ milieu, one where not only can I fall naturally into conversation with a fire-priestess,\
  \ but one where she is a common subject of discussion among the bien pensants. That\
  \ is very unlikely to happen in my bailiwick, where I do not think I have ever met\
  \ a fire-priestess. Nor have I heard anybody talking about one, though to be fair\
  \ most of the people who live around here speak in barbaric incoherent grunts, if\
  \ they speak at all.\nShortly after writing the above paragraph, I decided to immerse\
  \ myself in some serious fire-priestess research. I took the phone off the hook,\
  \ drew down the blinds, barricaded the door, and crouched in the middle of the living\
  \ room in the stance Bl\xF6tzmann\_calls \u201Cthe alert chaffinch\u201D (see the\
  \ Third Notebook, Lilac Series). Concentrating hard for twenty seconds as recommended,\
  \ I was then able to proceed. I put on my shoes and Tyrolean sports casual jacket,\
  \ unbarricaded the door, and pranced off to the railway station, where I bought\
  \ a ticket to Shoeburyness.\nUsing the Bl\xF6tzmann\_method, I had ascertained that\
  \ the Essex coastal town was a likely milieu to find everyone babbling about a fire-priestess\
  \ and, indeed, a fire-priestess herself. I would then be able to meet with her and\
  \ deploy the line from Game Of Thrones. To do so had become my dearest wish, to\
  \ the point, I suppose, of mania.\nShoeburyness is notable for its proximity to\
  \ the large Ministry of Defence facility at Pig's Bay and also for its bottomless\
  \ viper pit, of which I have written previously. As I disembarked from my train,\
  \ I was confident that my Bl\xF6tzmann-inspired hunch was correct, and I immediately\
  \ pranced into the railway station canteen to commune with Shoeburynessites who,\
  \ I felt sure, would have no other topic on their lips than the presence in the\
  \ town of a fire-priestess. I bought a cup of tea, a sausage snack, and a slice\
  \ of fruitcake, and sat down at one of the tables, cocking my ears.\nTo my bitter\
  \ disappointment, in the time it took me to munch my sausage and fruitcake and to\
  \ drain my teacup, I heard not a single mention of a fire-priestess. Ukip, badgers,\
  \ foopball, Ruskin's Fors Clavigera, the weather\u2014these seemed to be the hot\
  \ topics in Shoeburyness that day. I crashed out of the door and went prancing through\
  \ the streets, down to the beach. Nobody I passed had a word to say about a fire-priestess.\n\
  I wondered if perhaps I might draw her to me by setting fire to a waste bin. I found\
  \ one, overflowing with paper and cardboard and seaside detritus, and ignited it\
  \ with my lighter. As I hoped, a woman came rushing towards me. She was dressed\
  \ in the uniform of a Shoeburyness Seaside Community Support Patrol Officer, but\
  \ I knew, deep down in my gut, that it was merely a disguise. I opened my mouth,\
  \ about to speak the magical words, but before I could do so she unleashed a Tazer\
  \ and zapped me, deep down in my gut.\nAs I lay writhing on the ground, panting\
  \ and frazzled, she doused the flames in the waste bin. But here is the curious\
  \ thing. She did so by making the tiniest gesture, a significant sweeping movement\
  \ of her hand through the air, so quick it was virtually imperceptible. Only a fire-priestess\
  \ could do that!, I thought, before losing consciousness.\nWhen I came to, I discovered\
  \ I had been bundled into the freight van of a train, and it was just pulling out\
  \ of Shoeburyness station. Pinned to my Tyrolean sports casual jacket was a civic\
  \ proclamation banning me from ever setting foot in the town again. I staggered\
  \ to my feet, and peered out of the train window, and there on the platform I saw,\
  \ waving at me, her flaming red Pre-Raphaelite tresses blowing in the breeze, her\
  \ eyes pools of fathomless inky-black witchery, the Shoeburyness Seaside Community\
  \ Support Patrol Officer. Only I knew her for what she truly was. But as I gazed,\
  \ the train gathered speed, and soon she was but a speck in the distance, and then\
  \ she was gone.\n[2013-06-06]"
