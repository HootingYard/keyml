text: "\nAt last, a proper job! It is with some pride that I announce my adoption\
  \ by an American baseball team as their mascot. According to the Baltimore Orioles,\
  \ I am \u201Ca family friendly character\u201D, and apparently I was unveiled just\
  \ last week, though I must admit I don't recall the event. Perhaps I was taking\
  \ a nap at the time.\nParticularly exciting is that I have been given my own army,\
  \ known as \u201CFrank Key's Army\u201D. I think I shall lead them on manoeuvres\
  \ in the near future, though rather than deploying them to one of the world's trouble\
  \ spots it might be more satisfying to set them, armed to the teeth, upon defenceless\
  \ persons I abhor. Luckily, I do not detest quite so many people as Percy Grainger\
  \ did, so the world is (relatively) safe in my hands.\nOf course, becoming a deeply\
  \ adored mascot would cause a swimming in the head for an unstable or partly deranged\
  \ person, so I will be careful to keep a proper perspective. Now I must go and drill\
  \ the troops and issue them with their blunderbusses, muskets, and surface-to-air\
  \ missiles.\n\n[2011-04-20]"
