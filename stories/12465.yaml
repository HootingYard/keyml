text: 'Well, not the state of the nation, really, but the state of that godforsaken
  blot that is Mr Key''s mental bailiwick. This weekend I have mostly been poking
  about in the flues of Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives, doing a final
  bit of dusting before I tie the manuscript to the leg of a postal pigeon and wave
  it away, into the blue beyond, to be deposited on the desk of my editor at Constable.
  With the book done, at last, I shall be able to return to full-time active service
  duty at Hooting Yard. Watch this space.
