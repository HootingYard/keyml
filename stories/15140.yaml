text: 'Yesterday''s Hooting Yard On The Air on Resonance104.4FM contained further
  plum-based radiophonic frolics. Listen carefully. I expect there will be yet more
  of this next week, until I have exhausted plums and turn my attention to another
  fruit, or even a completely non-fruit-related topic.

  And don''t forget that the lines are still open for our 2016 Christmas Appeal, and
  will remain open untll 24 December.
