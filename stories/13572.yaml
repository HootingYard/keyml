text: "Whither art? It's a question I often ask myself, usually when tucking into\
  \ a plate of smokers\u2019 poptarts or other breakfast-based snack food. I like\
  \ to get art out of the way early on in the day, freeing up my time for higher things.\
  \ I do not practise art myself, but it is a subject of abiding interest to me. Whither\
  \ art?, I ask, wondering where it will go.\nTo answer that question, one must of\
  \ course be familiar with where art has been. One follows its trajectory, from the\
  \ earliest cave paintings to the latest talentless derivative didactic Marxist video\
  \ installation bollocks, and one tries to push the line further along, to see whence\
  \ it leads. Every morning, at breakfast.\nSometimes, alas, those smokers\u2019 poptarts\
  \ are just too damned delicious, and the brain that ought to be cogitating upon\
  \ the future of art is instead benumbed in a lovely haze of gustatory bliss. At\
  \ such times, all thoughts of art fly away, like unto a flock of starlings, and\
  \ instead I ponder the sheer genius of modern breakfast snack food manufacturing\
  \ processes.\nBut the next morning, after a day devoted to the higher things, things\
  \ such as prayer and beekeeping and shove ha'penny, I return to that burning question,\
  \ whither art?, as a dog returns to its vomit, and I wrestle with it, at least until\
  \ breakfast is digested.\nVery occasionally, when for example I have a stomach upset,\
  \ I do not ask whither art?, but instead declaim, in a booming tone, wither, art!\
  \ I curse art and I envision a glorious new world where art curdles and shrivels\
  \ until at last it is gone, all of it, forever. But of course we know full well,\
  \ all that truly withers is Googie (1917\u20142011).\n[2014-12-18]"
