text: "After I mentioned Prudence Foxglove the other day, I was deluged with post\
  \ from readers avid for more information about her. I am currently working on a\
  \ biography of the unsung Victorian genius which, though potted, will also be magisterial.\
  \ Meanwhile, I have managed to dig out an excerpt from her play May The Light Of\
  \ Our Saviour Beam Down Upon The Cripples And Paupers Of Every Parish In The Land\
  \ (1894).\n[Scene\_: A filthy hovel steeped in gloom.]\nDrunken Brute\_: Go and\
  \ get my bludgeon so I can bludgeon you about the head in a fit of intoxicated rage.\n\
  Urchin\_: Lumme, guvnor, you're as frightening a brute as ever bludgeoned a poor\
  \ half-blind urchin about the head!\nDrunken Brute\_: Yes I am, and if you don't\
  \ get my bludgeon this instant I'll box your ears as well, you urchin you.\nUrchin\_\
  : Oh! Did ever a poor half-blind urchin lead so squalid and unChristian a life as\
  \ I am fated to do since my parents perished in an early railway accident and I\
  \ was abducted from Kindly Old Ma Dropsy's Idyllic Cottage For Pallid Infants by\
  \ the Drunken Brute?\n[Urchin exits to fetch Drunken Brute's bludgeon. Drunken Brute\
  \ does some comic business with a birdcage and a set of napkins. Enter Urchin, holding\
  \ a prayer book.]\nDrunken Brute\_: What now, Urchin? That looks to me suspiciously\
  \ like a prayer book.\nUrchin\_: It is a prayer book, Drunken Brute. While I was\
  \ stumbling half-blind about the other part of the filthy hovel, trying to find\
  \ the bludgeon, a proper posh lady dressed all in finery came and handed it to me,\
  \ suggesting that I read some prayers to you.\nDrunken Brute\_: Grrr. I've a good\
  \ mind to give you a double boxing of the ears.\nUrchin\_: Yes, that is quite understandable,\
  \ given that you are a Drunken Brute. But perhaps the lady was right, and that if\
  \ I read you some prayers you will be engulfed in the light of Our Saviour, and\
  \ no longer be drunken and brutish but a reformed character of sober mien and a\
  \ determination to devote your life to hard work and social advancement.\n[Urchin\
  \ begins to recite prayer. Drunken Brute is seized by pangs of remorse and self-loathing\
  \ and collapses into his chair. Enter Prudence Foxglove.]\nPrudence Foxglove\_:\
  \ My name is Prudence Foxglove, and I am the proper posh lady who pounced upon this\
  \ half-blind Urchin in the other part of the filthy hovel. And see what wonders\
  \ I have wrought by bringing the word of Our Saviour into this benighted hellhole.\
  \ Note, too, the daring modernism of my play, where I, the authoress, barge into\
  \ the action and address you, the audience, directly. We shall leave the Urchin\
  \ and the Drunken Brute bedazzled by the Lord's light, and in Act Two we shall cast\
  \ our eyes upon another scene of moral depravity and high debauch. The scene is\
  \ another, filthier, hovel, where a smallpox-scarred match-girl is at the mercy\
  \ of a different drunken brute, until by chance they hear a thunderous sermon from\
  \ an Oxford-educated preacher, a man of stern Protestant rectitude, and their lives\
  \ are transformed.\n[2008-09-24]"
