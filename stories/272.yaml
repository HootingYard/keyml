text: "Dear Frank, writes Jonathan Coleclough, I recently attended an illustrated\
  \ lecture at the History of Reading Society on the subject of chalk mining in Reading.\
  \ I was delighted to see that the first screen of the presentation was a quote about\
  \ brick manufacture with the single-word attribution \u201CDobson\u201D. From that\
  \ point on I was confident I would have a good evening. I wasn't disappointed.\n\
  The subject of chalk mining is of interest in this area, as the enclosed photo illustrates.\n\
