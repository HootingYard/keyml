text: "Pebblehead, that titan of the potboiler, has always kept secret the precise\
  \ whereabouts of his legendary \u201Cchalet o\u2019 prose\u201D, wherein he taps\
  \ out the billions of words of his bestselling paperbacks. On a recent hiking holiday,\
  \ however, the noted daubist Rex Daub stumbled upon the location, and was able to\
  \ execute a rapid daub in his portable hikers\u2019 daubum.\n\nThe chalet o\u2019\
  \ prose itself remains half hidden behind a verdant slope. In the foreground, we\
  \ see postie struggling up the lane heaving a sack full of fan mail. You will note\
  \ that he is not wearing a postie's uniform. That is because, in this mountainous\
  \ region, wherever it is, all the posties are amateurs, a tradition harking back\
  \ to the days of King Vud. This lame and pocky monarch took against professionalised\
  \ posties in uniform from an early age, after a tantrum. It was an opinion from\
  \ which he never wavered, and his first act upon his coronation was to grant crown\
  \ licences for postal delivery to a gaggle of peasant amateurs. The existing uniformed\
  \ posties were shipped off to a remote and barnacle-encrusted atoll.\nAlso in the\
  \ picture we see Pebblehead's famous \u201Cseven cows\u201D, munching grass on the\
  \ verdant slope. The paperbackist has written movingly of these cows, or of six\
  \ of them at least, and rather more dispassionately about the seventh, in a series\
  \ of cow-related potboilers. Clockwise in the picture, starting from the largest\
  \ cow, we see Spinach, Toffee Apple, Miliband, Chlorophyll, Banana Brain, Graticule\
  \ and Gaston Le Mesmer, all of them familiar to readers of the series, but not,\
  \ until now, visually, caught brilliantly as they are by Rex Daub's daubing.\nBeyond\
  \ the chalet o\u2019 prose, the roof of which we see, blue, blue, there is some\
  \ other stuff in the background, but Rex Daub may have invented this just to finish\
  \ off his daub. It is a tendency he has, when in a hurry, as he often is, whether\
  \ or not on a hiking holiday. For further particulars see A Pedestrian Memoir Of\
  \ Hiking Holidays Accompanied By Noted Daubist Rex Daub by Dobson (out of print).\n\
