  \ The Universe or The Infinitely Great and the Infinitely Little by F A Pouchet\
  \ M.D. (1882). In this picture, we see gnomes of German legend laying bare the skeleton\
  \ of an ichthyosaurus. As Mr Jennings so rightly says, \u201Cthe mind boggles\u2026\
  \ well, mine doesn't boggle so much these days, but yours might\u201D.\n\n[2012-01-21]"
