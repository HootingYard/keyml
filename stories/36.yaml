text: "Last week we held a funeral service for the parish wolf, although none of us\
  \ is sure if it is really dead. Its howling has not been heard for twelve years,\
  \ though, and under our laws a death certificate can be issued for a missing wolf\
  \ after just five years. The general feeling in the parish was summed up by the\
  \ sexton in a notice nailed, Luther fashion, to the door of the church. Even in\
  \ the absence of a corpse, it would be for the good of the parish if obsequies were\
  \ held. This was the gist of his notice, though it was couched in the mighty prose\
  \ he deployed even when writing nature notes for the parish newsletter, and he did\
  \ not on any account use the word closure.\nOne reason the sexton is so persuasive\
  \ is that his appearance and bearing are strongly reminiscent of the actor James\
  \ Robertson Justice (1907\u20131975). This is no accident. Over the years, the sexton\
  \ has worked hard to imitate that booming voice, and he has undergone cosmetic surgery\
  \ the better to ape the appearance of the man who, when not appearing in films,\
  \ kept busy as a naturalist, racing driver, and falconry expert.\n\nBefore dawn\
  \ on the morning of the funeral there was a teeming downpour. The rain had ceased\
  \ by the time we gathered in the churchyard, but the pugton trees were drenched,\
  \ water droplets dripping from the tiny grey spongy buds, each bud like the brain\
  \ of a homunculus. An extraordinary number of puddles had formed on the paths, and\
  \ there are many paths converging on St Bibblydibdib's, for it is the only church\
  \ for miles around, all others having been smashed to ruination by the sexton's\
  \ predecessor, single-handedly. He was twice the size of the present incumbent,\
  \ a titan among sextons, and a brute, and the parish has been much quieter since\
  \ he wilted away and was carted off to a mercy home. No ducks plashed in the puddles,\
  \ for word had not yet reached them that the parish wolf was dead, or at least thought\
  \ to be dead, and no duck dared come near for fear of being torn to bits.\nI had\
  \ been asked to read the obsequies, and had prepared what I thought was a pretty\
  \ speech. I have a weakness for alliteration, and made use of lots of W words, describing\
  \ the parish wolf as winsome and windswept and waterlogged and wiry and woebegone\
  \ and witless. There was little truth in any of this, for the signal fact about\
  \ the wolf was that it was, for the most part, invisible. Kim Fat Goo, the village\
  \ bus driver, claimed to have seen it crossing the road once or twice, and the preposterous\
  \ tabloid astrologer Jonathan Cainer, who once spent a week holed up in Old Ma Brimstone's\
  \ Bed And Breakfast establishment, said that the wolf paid him nocturnal visits\
  \ in his dingy room, but few of us gave these tales any credence. Yet despite remaining\
  \ unseen, the wolf was\u2014or had been\u2014a mighty presence in our parish, and\
  \ I felt it deserved a memorable send-off, with all those W words, even if what\
  \ I said was inaccurate.\nOur vicar had been abducted by a cadre of rogue Tundists\
  \ and was tied up in a turret somewhere, so the sexton took charge of the service.\
  \ When it came my turn to speak, no sooner had I propped my notepad on the lectern\
  \ and cleared my throat than there came a bellowing of cows from the fields adjoining\
  \ the church. My words were drowned out. The cows bellowed all day and all night\
  \ and into the next day, for they were Mad Old Farmer Frack's cows, and there were\
  \ hundreds of them, massive and ungainly and bellowing. The funeral broke up in\
  \ disarray, and we repaired to a hangar at the village airfield, and we ate cake\
  \ and macadamia nuts under the shadow of gigantic propellers, and when we emerged,\
  \ look!, ducks populated the puddles. The parish wolf was dead and gone.\n[2007-02-09]"
