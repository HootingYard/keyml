text: "As a writer of bestselling paperbacks, Pebblehead tends not to attract serious\
  \ critical attention. Too often, his works are dismissed as pap for airheads, and\
  \ while this is arguably the case with such works as Pap For Airheads, Slops Of\
  \ Triviality Sloshing About Between The Ears, and his thriller The Glazed Stare\
  \ Of The Brain-Dead Mop-Bucket Zombie, it is an encouraging sign that one or two\
  \ scholars are addressing the Pebblehead oeuvre with perspicuity and panache. Well,\
  \ one, rather than one or two.\nI refer to Sidney Ullage's recent article in the\
  \ literary journal Bookish Goo in which he examines the influence of ploppy noises\
  \ in Pebblehead's as yet unpublished blockbuster Dustbin Of Pomposity! Using critical\
  \ techniques developed by men with terrific beards, Ullage argues that we cannot\
  \ begin to understand the book without first being locked up in a dank cellar in\
  \ which beetles scurry across the mildewed floor and mysterious ploppy noises can\
  \ be heard, possibly coming from behind a panel hidden in the gloom.\nThere are\
  \ those who poo-poo Ullage's close reasoning and breathtaking critical acuity as\
  \ the ravings of an idiot. There are those who accuse him of having a decidedly\
  \ oddly-shaped head and the wrong sort of beard. There are those who, having engaged\
  \ him in conversation at glamorous cocktail parties in swish urban rooftop gardens,\
  \ dismiss him as a babbling freak with \u201Cissues\u201D. There are those who wish\
  \ he had been strangled at birth and disposed of in a pond. There are those who\
  \ wish he had never been born at all. There are those who grunt unintelligibly at\
  \ the mention of his name. There are those who pick holes in the sleeves of their\
  \ jumpers before shovelling the contents of a jar of pickled sausages down their\
  \ gullets.\nI am proud to be among those who rightly see Sidney Ullage as a harbinger.\
  \ I am not yet entirely clear what he harbinges, but by all that is holy in heaven\
  \ and on earth I shall stand here and repeat what I have just said, over and over\
  \ again, until not only am I blue in the face, but everything around me that has\
  \ a face, the hens, the cows, the cassowaries, the ducks, the other ducks, they,\
  \ too, all turn blue in the face, a blue like the mightiest of skies over Pointy\
  \ Town on a blazing noon when the earth stops spinning.\n[2008-04-24]"
