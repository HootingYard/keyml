text: "In an 1845 issue of The Mysteries Of London, G W M Reynolds provided a useful\
  \ list of the sorts of items available from unregulated street-stalls in the districts\
  \ of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green, \u201Centire streets that are nought but sinks\
  \ of misery and vice\u2014dark courts, foetid with puddles of black slimy water\u2014\
  alleys, blocked up with heaps of filth, and nauseating with unwholesome odours\u2026\
  \ abodes of sorrow, vice, and destitution\u2026 vile streets, inhabited by the very\
  \ lowest of the low, the most filthy of the squalid, and the most profligate of\
  \ the immoral\u201D.\nHad you been among the most filthy of the squalid, you could\
  \ have taken your pick from stalls selling \u201Cfish, fresh and fried, oysters,\
  \ sweet-stuff, vegetables, fruit, cheap publications, sop-in-the-pan, shrimps and\
  \ periwinkles, hair-combs, baked potatoes, liver and lights, curds and whey, sheep's\
  \ heads, haddocks and red-herrings\u201D.\nI for one would be only too pleased to\
  \ see sop-in-the-pan on sale in our major supermarkets, even if it were pre-packaged\
  \ under their own brand.\n[2009-07-02]"
