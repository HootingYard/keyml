text: "There have been many studies of the consequences of the war, so on the face\
  \ of it yet another one would seem unnecessary. I feel compelled to add my own for\
  \ two reasons. First, that the extant studies are uniformly mistaken, foolish, and\
  \ sprawling. Secondly, this one is by me and is therefore fantastic. It is also\
  \ considerably shorter than those sprawling studies, so you will be all clued up\
  \ on the consequences of the war, and able to spout intelligently about them at\
  \ cocktail parties, having spent only a fraction of the time needed to digest the\
  \ mistaken foolish sprawls.\nWell, you will not be able to spout at cocktail parties,\
  \ of course, because one of the consequences of the war is that cocktail parties\
  \ are a thing of the past. It is difficult to host a halfway decent cocktail party\
  \ in a landscape that had been reduced to crumbling ruins. I have no idea what Beamish\
  \ is going on about in his mistaken and foolish and sprawling study, Some Notes\
  \ On The Consequences Of The War Vis A Vis Fashionable Cocktail Parties. He claims\
  \ to have personally attended no fewer than five such elegant social occasions in\
  \ the six weeks immediately after the cessation of hostilities, though I note he\
  \ is very cagey, very cagey indeed, about where these events are supposed to have\
  \ taken place. He only gives one definite postal address\u201414b Hysteria Mews\u2014\
  and it did not take much research for me to discover that this is now the site of\
  \ a foetid swamp bubbling with hazardous chemicals. The only standing structure\
  \ for miles around is the old coastguard's hut. Thinking that perhaps some brainsick\
  \ noddies had snuck past the barbed wire to hold a cocktail party there, I donned\
  \ protective clothing and made my way in, only to discover that the roof and the\
  \ ceiling and the floor had all collapsed, and that the pit thus formed below ground\
  \ was home to a family of savage mutant otters. By all means go hither and try sipping\
  \ a cocktail while engaged in elegant chitchat if you dare. But don't blame me if\
  \ you emerge bitten and clawed and bloody and wishing for a quick death.\nBeamish\
  \ is also the author of Some Notes On The Consequences Of The War Vis A Vis The\
  \ Fixture List For The Domestic Pole-Vaulting League. It astonishes me that this\
  \ book sprawls over nine hundred pages, excluding the index and appendices. I would\
  \ have only one \u201Cnote\u201D on the subject, and it would read as follows: \u201C\
  In the aftermath of the war, there are no fixtures\u201D. Yes, one could expand\
  \ upon that by recalling the heady days of the prewar pole-vaulting team meetings,\
  \ and the contrast with the postwar scene, but there is only so much one can say.\
  \ Beamish, poor deluded Beamish, seems to be under the impression that pole-vaulting\
  \ events are still taking place on Saturday afternoons, all across the land. Perhaps\
  \ he is hallucinating. Certainly a population of stunted beggars with withered limbs\
  \ is in no fit state to pole-vault over even a tiny pile of pebbles, if, that is,\
  \ one could find anywhere a pole-vaulting pole that had not been reduced to ashes\
  \ and dust, or been commandeered to prop up something that would otherwise collapse,\
  \ like an old coastguard's hut.\nBut Beamish is hardly the worst offender. More\
  \ mistaken, more foolish, and more sprawling is An A To Z Of The Consequences Of\
  \ The War by Alonzo Zumbag. This weighs in at over two thousand closely-printed\
  \ pages, with more than six hundred entries under the letter A alone. And what a\
  \ lot of bosh it is! If we are to believe Mr Zumbag, the following things have improved\
  \ considerably since the end of the war: apples, apricots, alabaster, amnesiacs,\
  \ aircraft (both real and model), ants, aniseed, aspirin, the month of April (but\
  \ not, curiously, August), antiques, art, aglets, air, and antimony. Not a shred\
  \ of evidence is offered in support of such blithering claptrap as \u201COne of\
  \ the consequences of the war is that Airfix modelling glue for model aeroplanes\
  \ is now hundreds of times more gluey and sticky than it was before the war. Truly\
  \ it is the king of adhesive pastes!\u201D\nThis is patently untrue. Last week,\
  \ for example, I was foraging around in a waterlogged bomb crater hoping to find\
  \ a sprig of nettles to keep me alive until teatime, when I came upon an almost\
  \ intact Airfix model kit. It was a seventy-six piece miniature of a Swordfish 109\
  \ Plasmatron Fighter Jet, complete with a tube of modelling glue. To pass the time,\
  \ and to distract myself from the pangs of hunger and thirst and from the hideous\
  \ suppurations of my many and various sores and boils, I squatted in a puddle and\
  \ put the model together. But when it came time to apply the glue, the stuff that\
  \ squirted out of the tube was neither gluey nor sticky. What it was was highly\
  \ acidic, like the blood of the alien in Alien, and it burned holes in my arms and\
  \ legs and torso which ache like billy-o. If that is better than prewar Airfix modelling\
  \ glue, then I am a Swiss cheese. Actually, I am beginning to resemble a Swiss cheese,\
  \ what with all these burning acid holes.\nSo if you take my advice you will throw\
  \ away any of those Consequences Of The War studies you have bought, and stick with\
  \ this one. I will not pretend I have been going to elegant cocktail parties. I\
  \ will not claim to have attended a pole-vaulting league match. And I will have\
  \ nothing good to say about anything beginning with A, let alone with B or with\
  \ the other letters of the alphabet, not all of which I can remember. I was such\
  \ a butterfingers with that tube of so-called \u201Cking of adhesive pastes\u201D\
  \ that I managed to squirt a goodly dollop on to my head. It ate its way through\
  \ the flesh and bone right into my brain and out the other side, and I must admit\
  \ to feeling not quite myself ever since. I have even begun wondering if there actually\
  \ was a war, before which this land was a sort of paradise. Maybe it is all a phantasm,\
  \ and I have always, for my entire life, squatted in a puddle under a foul black\
  \ sky, half blind from gas, and starving and withered of limb, scrubbling in the\
  \ muck for a sprig of poisonous nettle, happy as a warlord.\n[2012-10-15]"
