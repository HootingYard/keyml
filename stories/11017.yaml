text: 'It is fundraising week at ResonanceFM, and I do encourage you to empty your
  bank account accordingly. There is the annual auction of enticing things, not least
  of which is a copy of the legendary Malice Aforethought Press paperback Twitching
  And Shattered, signed by Mr Key just the other day. Do remember that Resonance is
  a shoestring operation, that none of us who make the programmes get paid a penny,
  and that without your support the whole thing will go down the drain. Be generous!
