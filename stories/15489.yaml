text: "In When I Was Borp, the narrator tells us that, on finding fools in his orchard,\
  \ he drove them out. This may be truth or it may be fiction\u2014he is not an entirely\
  \ reliable narrator\u2014but either way it is a clear reference to Expulsion Of\
  \ The Fools From The Orchard, a mag, a maj, oh, a magnificent and majestic oil painting\
  \ by the noted oil painter Dot Oilpain RA.\nThose initials after her name are often\
  \ thought to indicate, mistakenly, that Dot Oilpain is a member of the Royal Academy.\
  \ In fact they stand for Rara Avis. The artist considers herself to be a rare bird,\
  \ and likes to wear a cardboard beak and a suit of feathers when working.\nJust\
  \ as, in her case, the letters RA are misinterpreted, so too her magnificent and\
  \ majestic oil painting. Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard depicts two fools\
  \ being expelled from an orchard, one male and one female. They are both naked,\
  \ and the female fool is holding a piece of fruit from which a chunk has been bitten.\
  \ Understandably, the subject matter is thought to be Biblical. But this is not\
  \ the case, as Dot Oilpain explained in an interview with Misinterpreted Oil Paintings\
  \ Weekly magazine.\nIt is true that I have mined the Bible for inspiration in the\
  \ past. There are, for instance, my oil paintings of the Gadarene swine, the hairy\
  \ man and the smooth man, everyone drinking the waters of their own cistern, and\
  \ the horse saying \u201Cha ha\u201D among the trumpets in the Book of Job. But\
  \ Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard has absolutely nothing to do with Adam\
  \ and Eve being driven out of the Garden of Eden.\nThe idea for the painting came\
  \ from a conversation I had at a swish sophisticated cocktail party. I was not there\
  \ by invitation\u2014I stumbled into it under the misapprehension that it was a\
  \ gathering of ornithologists, among whom I hoped to garner some tips for finessing\
  \ my cardboard beak and suit of feathers, which I always wear when painting. By\
  \ the time I realised that nobody in the room knew the first thing about birds,\
  \ I had already drunk several cocktails and I felt a bit woozy. Worried that I might\
  \ topple over, I leaned against a mantelpiece to steady myself. Also leaning against\
  \ the mantelpiece, insouciantly, was a fellow who was clearly not an ornithologist\
  \ but who nevertheless had the air of a jackdaw, or a budgerigar. We struck up a\
  \ conversation, initially regarding mantelpieces, insouciance, cocktail parties,\
  \ jackdaws, budgerigars, and the comparative merits of Kathy Kirby and Petula Clark.\n\
  Then this chap told me about his orchard, and how it had been overrun by fools fooling\
  \ about in it. \u201CAre you saying Petula Clark is a fool?\u201D I shouted, in\
  \ outrage, for if there is one thing I cannot bear it is to hear a word said against\
  \ Petula Clark. My interlocutor hastened to assure me that we had moved on to a\
  \ completely separate conversational topic and that he, too, held Petula Clark in\
  \ the highest regard, higher, perhaps, than any other twentieth-century songstress,\
  \ with the possible exception of Cathy Berberian.\nI spluttered and spat some of\
  \ my cocktail into the fireplace. \u201CPshaw!\u201D I yelled, \u201CCathy Berberian\
  \ couldn't sing her way out of a paper bag, compared to the sainted and glorious\
  \ Petula Clark!\u201D In retrospect I am not sure this assertion stands up to scrutiny,\
  \ but then nor do most assertions made at cocktail parties after a certain point.\n\
  After several minutes of back and forth, and further cocktails, it eventually dawned\
  \ on me that the orchard full of fools was indeed a completely separate conversational\
  \ topic and that my umbrage had been misplaced. This in turn led to a creative spark\
  \ setting off fireworks in my head as I envisaged a magnificent and majestic oil\
  \ painting entitled Misplaced Umbrage. I was ready to bid farewell to the non-ornithologist\
  \ and to rush away to my chalet peinture, don my cardboard beak and suit of feathers,\
  \ and set to work.\nBut he grabbed my arm and, with a wild look in his eyes, began\
  \ gabbling about how he had driven the fools from his orchard, caring not a jot\
  \ that they were naked and that one of them had just started snacking on a piece\
  \ of fruit. So compelling was his tale that I could not help but listen, rapt, as\
  \ rapt as I would listen to a Petula Clark platter spinning at 45rpm on my record\
  \ player. And as I listened, the lineaments of a huge oil painting took form in\
  \ my mind's eye. Thus was born Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard. I began\
  \ to paint it that very night. It took months to complete. I do not wish to boast,\
  \ but I think it is the finest oil painting of fools being expelled from an orchard\
  \ that I have ever painted, in oil paint, while wearing a cardboard beak and a suit\
  \ of feathers, the better to inhabit my desired persona of a rara avis, Popsy.\n\
  [Popsy is the given name of the editrix of Misinterpreted Oil Paintings Weekly,\
  \ who conducted the interview.]\nExpulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard by Dot\
  \ Oilpain RA is currently on show at the Staatsgalerie, Pointy Town, as part of\
  \ the exhibition \u201CCack-Handed Daubs Of Oil Paint Slathered On Vast Sheets Of\
  \ Corrugated Cardboard\u201D. Entry is free, on production of a handful of birdseed.\n\
