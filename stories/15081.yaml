text: "One of the most fab of Boxing Day traditions is the annual gathering around\
  \ the bottomless viper-pit at Shoeburyness. Forming a circle around the pit, and\
  \ holding hands, the participants come dressed in motley, with trimmings of gimp\
  \ passementerie. Eyes fixed steadily upon the viper-pit, they then recite passages\
  \ from various works by Alain de Botton, before singing, to the accompaniment of\
  \ bassoon and piccolo, \u201CMore Than A Feeling\u201D by Boston. They then remain\
  \ in silent contemplation until sunset, at which point they disperse, all except\
  \ one, bent on self-obliteration, who is taken by the wrists and ankles and flung,\
  \ voluntarily, into the pit.\nI attended today, as I have done for countless years\
  \ past, and I am pleased to report that a fine time was had by all. The sole disappointment\
  \ was that, as usual, not a single viper slithered out of the bottomless pit to\
  \ grace us with its vipery Boxing Day presence, dammit!\n[2016-12-26]"
