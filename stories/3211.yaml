text: "Here is a verbatim transcript of a snatch of dialogue from my dream last night.\n\
  Boffin\_: You do realise that the entire human brain could be recreated in the lab\
  \ from a single cell of a finch?*\nMr Key\_: Would that be an attractive little\
  \ finch like the siskin?\nBoffin\_: Sadly, no.\n\nAttractive little finch courtesy\
  \ of the Fleet Pond Blog\n* NOTE\_: My dream-boffin speaks false, of course. This\
  \ is not actually true. Just my luck to have dreams peopled by mendacious boffins!\n\
