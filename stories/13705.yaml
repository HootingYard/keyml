text: "A letter arrives from Sophonisba Gullsbeak:\nDear Mr Key, I am writing to ask\
  \ for your help. I have been commissioned by an important publishing house to compile\
  \ A Dictionary Of Fruit-Related Popular Music Nomenclature. It has all been going\
  \ swimmingly, but at the letter P I have reached an impasse. It has proved beyond\
  \ my considerable wit to discover from what type of fruit the legendary Pips who\
  \ accompanied soul singer Gladys Knight were eked. It goes without saying that readers\
  \ of my dictionary will expect chapter and verse on this one, and the book would\
  \ prove a sorry specimen indeed if it did not include this crucially important information.\
  \ Given the astounding depth and breadth of your erudition in oh! so many spheres,\
  \ it occurred to me that you could well be in possession of the pip-facts, daddy-o,\
  \ as the young persons might say. I would be immensely grateful if you could tell\
  \ me, by return of post, the answer to my query, with references if possible. Yours\
  \ pleadingly, Sophonisba Gullsbeak (Miss).\nI am afraid to say that I haven't got\
  \ a clue. Dobson, the titanic pamphleteer of the twentieth century, compiled a similar\
  \ Dictionary Of Fruit- And Nut-Related Jazz And Blues Nomenclature (out of print),\
  \ but the soul music of Gladys Knight And The Pips fell outwith his frame of reference.\
  \ All I can suggest is that perhaps you obtain high-definition photographic enlargements\
  \ of the pips of every fruit-with-pips you can think of, and then compare these\
  \ with photographs of the Pips. It is possible you might be able to note certain\
  \ striking resemblances. Of course, it is equally possible you might not.\nBy the\
  \ way, I cannot help wondering if you, like your namesake Sophonisba Peale, daughter\
  \ of the American painter, soldier, scientist, inventor, politician, and naturalist\
  \ Charles Willson Peale (1741\u20131827) have three brothers named Raphael, Rembrandt,\
  \ and Rubens. Do let me know.\n[2015-01-20]"
