text: "While I struggle manfully with a patch of desolate-wasteland-between-the-ears\
  \ syndrome, here is another blast from the past, from this day exactly seven years\
  \ ago. I have made a few little amendments, as is my whim:\nA letter arrives from\
  \ our Antipodean researcher Glyn Webster.\nDear Uncle Dan\_: Recently my dreams\
  \ have been full of boredom and drudgery. The work is hard, the company is dull\
  \ and I'm thoroughly relieved to open my eyes in the morning. Sometimes I wake up\
  \ to find myself hauling my body out of the bed the way a shipwrecked sailor might\
  \ haul himself ashore. What is happening to me? Yours in all simplicity, Glyn.\n\
  Devoted Hooting Yard readers may remember Uncle Dan, who used to pen a column here\
  \ entitled Ask Uncle Dan. He was always generous with his advice on matters such\
  \ as leeks, vim, and an old bag full of crocuses, and you can revisit his wise words\
  \ by checking under \u2018A\u2019 in the 2003\u20132006 Archival Index.\nAlas, this\
  \ doyen of agony uncles is no longer with us. I always wondered what had happened\
  \ to him, and coincidentally, on the very day Mr Webster's letter arrived, the post\
  \ person's sack also contained this missive:\nDear Mr Key\_: You don't know me,\
  \ and I prefer to remain anonymous. I can tell you that I have a waxed moustache,\
  \ but I hope you will not take the same view as Robert Baden-Powell, who wrote \u2018\
  I was once accused of mistrusting men with waxed moustaches. Well, so, to a certain\
  \ extent, I do. It often means vanity and sometimes drink.\u2019\nI am not vain.\
  \ I drink only lukewarm tap water, dandelion and burdock, and occasionally Tizer.\
  \ I try not to preen my moustache overmuch, but I confess that waxing it has always\
  \ been a small pleasure of mine, and Lord knows I deserve a small measure of pleasure,\
  \ as who does not?\nBut to business! I am writing to you to pass on greetings from\
  \ a fellow I met up in the hills last Thursday. Like me, he was unwilling to divulge\
  \ his name, but he said that you would know who he was. He was dressed in billowing\
  \ cloth which looked as if once it had been a parachute or part of a parachute,\
  \ and his face had the pallor of bean curd. He too, sported a waxed moustache, but\
  \ I did not smell drink on his breath, nor did he seem to be puffed up with vanity.\
  \ It makes one wonder if Baden-Powell had any kind of grip on reality, quite frankly.\n\
  Anyway, as I say, we were up in the hills, this fellow and I. He was standing upright\
  \ on a boulder, peering intently at a speck in the sky in the far distance. \u2018\
  What do you see?\u2019 I asked, when I was close enough for him to hear me above\
  \ the wild and wailing wind. For answer, he merely pointed, and I turned to look\
  \ at the unmoving speck. Neither of us had binoculars, more's the pity.\n\u2018\
  I hear the sound of mandolins,\u2019 he said suddenly, in a voice which, curiously,\
  \ reminded me of television presenter Dale Winton, \u2018For wild is the wind. As\
  \ for what I see, look!, that speck is what I see. I have been watching it for three\
  \ hours and it has not moved. It is a very mysterious speck.\u2019\nI offered him\
  \ a plum from my fruit-bag, but he refused it because, he said, it was bruised,\
  \ and he would not eat bruised plums. Instead, he took a Surgeon's Biscuit from\
  \ some pocket or pouch concealed within his billowing cloth, and began chewing on\
  \ it. The wind was howling with even more violence now, and I bid the man come shelter\
  \ with me in an ornithologist's hide I knew of not a hundred paces away. He jumped\
  \ down from his perch on the boulder with surprising sprightliness, and then took\
  \ me by the arm. It was an overfamiliar yet somehow reassuring gesture.\nAnd so\
  \ we sat in the hide, me with my plums and he with his biscuits, and we waited for\
  \ the wind in the hills to die down. To pass the time, we played a game of Tea Strainers,\
  \ improvising with broken twigs.\nWhen we parted, an hour or so later, he returned\
  \ to his boulder and pointed out that the unmoving speck was still there. I looked,\
  \ but now I could not see it. I preened my moustache and said farewell, but not\
  \ before promising to write to you. Yours faithfully, Mister X.\nThere is no doubt\
  \ in my mind that the man my anonymous correspondent met in the hills was Uncle\
  \ Dan. He was always seeing still specks in the sky that were invisible to almost\
  \ everyone else, and was forever lamenting that, in all his years as an agony uncle,\
  \ no one wrote to him reporting a similar experience. I once asked him how he would\
  \ reply, if someone did, and he muttered something in his Dale Winton voice about\
  \ paralysed chaffinches caught and cushioned in air pockets.\nAs for Glyn Webster's\
  \ heartfelt plea, I have placed it in a cardboard box along with many other unanswered\
  \ letters to Uncle Dan. One day he may return to us, in his billowing cloth, with\
  \ his waxed moustache and his pallor of bean curd, and his mighty, towering wisdom.\n\
