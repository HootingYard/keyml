text: "I am sniffy about science fiction. The genre does not appeal to me. Over the\
  \ years I have read several sci-fi books\u2014or SF, or speculative fiction, or\
  \ whatever the preferred term is these days\u2014and though I have enjoyed some\
  \ of them, mildly, I feel no great urge to read more widely in the field. Similarly\
  \ with the cinema\u2014there are a few sci-fi films I like, but in general I will\
  \ actively avoid them. I have never, for example, seen Star Wars, nor any of its\
  \ seemingly inordinate sequels and prequels. Despite not having seen it, I tend\
  \ to agree with the critic who suggested that its success destroyed American cinema.\
  \ The vast majority of films churned out by Hollywood are pap, and pap of a certain\
  \ kind, for which George Lucas is to be held personally responsible.\nIn addition\
  \ to being sniffy about sci-fi, I am also diabetic. Until recently, these two parts\
  \ of my life could coexist without hoo-hah. I have to jab myself with insulin daily,\
  \ as a direct result of the debaucheries of my Wilderness Years. I do not find this\
  \ particularly onerous, and if anything it acts as a useful reminder not to revisit\
  \ those chaotic stupidities.\nBut a few weeks ago, after seeing a consultant whose\
  \ resemblance to Brian Eno is so eerily close that I would swear Brain One is moonlighting\
  \ as an NHS doctor, my regimen was changed. Instead of injecting one type of insulin\
  \ (Novomix), Brian recommended my diabetes would be better managed by using two\
  \ different preparations. It is the names of these that make me feel, daily, like\
  \ a collaborator in some awful sci-fi adventure.\nI do not know who is responsible\
  \ for the nomenclature of insulin solutions. Whomsoever it is clearly gave no thought\
  \ to the psychic damage wrought upon my tattered nerves by forcing me to inject\
  \ Humalog and the even more sci-fi-sounding Lantus Solostar.\nIn hindsight, Novomix\
  \ itself sounds like the name of a distant star in a galaxy far far away. One imagines\
  \ it as the setting where dashing space hero Lantus Solostar does battle with the\
  \ bumbling robots known as Humalogs.\nGod give me strength.\n\nLantus Solostar\n\
