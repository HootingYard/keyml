text: "I am deeply grateful to Odd Ends for posting a link to Astounding Stories Of\
  \ Super-Science, January 1931. Why so? Readers already know\u2014or ought to know\u2014\
  that I am no aficionado of SF, though oddly it seems some SF-minded persons are\
  \ keen on my work. Mine not to reason why.\nThere is one writer in the field, however,\
  \ cruelly neglected, whom I adore, unreservedly. I speak of course of Hal K Wells,\
  \ a man whose prose was forever pitched at hysteria level. Lap up those adverbs\
  \ and adjectives!\nI have just realised that I raved about Mr Wells as recently\
  \ as last April. No doubt my forgetfulness can be adduced to the shuddering miasma\
  \ of crepitant dread to which my brain has been reduced by reading this newly-posted\
  \ story, entitled The Gate To Xoran:\nThe attack of the Xoranians was hideously\
  \ effective. Clouds of dense yellow fog belched from countless projectors in the\
  \ hands of the bluish-gray hosts, and beneath that deadly miasma all animal and\
  \ plant life on the doomed planet was crumbling, dying, and rotting into a liquid\
  \ slime. Then even the slime was swiftly obliterated, and the Xoranians were left\
  \ triumphant upon a world starkly desolate.\n\u201CThat was one of the minor planets\
  \ in the swarm that make up the solar system of the sun that your astronomers call\
  \ Canopus,\u201D Arlok explained.\n\u201COur first task in conquering a world is\
  \ to rid it of the unclean surface scum of animal and plant life. When this noxious\
  \ surface mold is eliminated, the planet is then ready to furnish us sustenance,\
  \ for we Xoranians live directly upon the metallic elements of the planet itself.\
  \ Our bodies are of a substance of which your scientists have never even dreamed\u2014\
  deathless, invincible, living metal!\u201D\nYou know you should just stop whatever\
  \ else you are doing and go and read the whole brain-bedizening story right now.\
  \ Then unjangle your nerves with a nice cup of piping hot tea.\nNOTE\_: Checking\
  \ the link back to that April postage, I have noted\u2014not for the first time\u2014\
  some kind of formatting problem in older posts resulting in the appearance of extraneous\
  \ characters. I think this happened after the tumultuous and terrifying hacker attack\
  \ of some months ago. Steps will be taken, gingerly, to eradicate these alien hoofprints.\
  \ Until then, just try to ignore them.\n[2009-11-16]"
