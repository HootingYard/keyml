text: "The Heresiarch laments: \u201CThe depressing thing is that, increasingly, custard\
  \ is all we have left.\u201D\nBut remember the wise words of Ned Ward (1667\u2013\
  1731) in British Wonders; Or, A Poetical Description of the Several Prodigies and\
  \ Most Remarkable Accidents That have happen'd in Britain since the Death of Queen\
  \ Anne (1717):\n\u201CCustard, that noble cooling Food,/ So toothsome, wholsome,\
  \ and so good, / That Dainty so approv'd of old, / Whose yellow surface shines like\
  \ Gold.\u201D\nYou can find a longer extract from the poem, including some terrific\
  \ lines about pudding, at BabelStone.\n[2009-03-10]"
