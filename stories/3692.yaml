text: "It is not, I think, generally known that the notorious killer Babinsky was\
  \ also a man of letters. So the imminent publication of The Complete And Staggeringly\
  \ Voluminous Correspondence Of The Notorious Killer Babinsky, in no fewer than forty\
  \ volumes, is to be welcomed. Babinsky, it seems, when he could tear himself away\
  \ from the committal of blood-drenched enormities, wrote dozens upon dozens of letters,\
  \ every day, to a bewildering number of correspondents, some of whom actually replied.\n\
  An unexpectedly high proportion of his letters are on the subject of moles, and\
  \ are of scant interest to the general reader, although no doubt those as mole-dazed\
  \ as Babinsky will find much to interest them. But the great fascination of these\
  \ huge fat volumes lies in the very occasional letters written by Babinsky which\
  \ address wider topics. Those of us who have long wanted to know more about the\
  \ lumbering, murderous, walrus-moustached psychopath are well-served by this excellent\
  \ collection.\nConsider this, for example:\nDearest Tod [or possibly \u2018Tad\u2019\
  \ or \u2018Ted\u2019\u2014Babinsky's handwriting was atrocious], I am currently\
  \ hiding in a cave by the mighty, pitiless sea. Can you do me a favour and bring\
  \ me a goat, so I can slaughter it with my bare hands and eat it raw?\nThe very\
  \ next day, before he has received a reply, Babinsky writes to Tod again:\nBeloved\
  \ Tod, Is there such a thing as a goat suitable for vegans? One made out of marzipan\
  \ or\_No-Egg\u2122 and suet substitute? It clear slipped my mind, when I wrote to\
  \ you yesterday, that I have decided to eschew all animal products. While I take\
  \ a distinct pleasure in acts of sickening violence such as the Blister Lane Post\
  \ Office Horror of a few months ago, I would not wish to hurt a hair on a fly's\
  \ head. I am not entomologist enough to know whether flies actually have any hair\
  \ on their heads, but my point, I hope, is clear. When I am brought before the tribunal\
  \ of beasts, in a dingly dell, like something out of a Hicks painting, I want to\
  \ be able to hold my head high, and preen my walrus moustache, and cry: \u201CI\
  \ vowed, when hiding in a cave by the sea, never again to harm a single animal nor\
  \ eat one, and I have kept my promise, O beasts, and survived on lettuce and radishes\
  \ and many types of fruit and marzipan goats!\u201D I will be very grateful if you\
  \ can sort something out, because the night is drawing in and the waves are crashing\
  \ on the rocks and I am getting quite peckish.\nElsewhere, Babinsky can strike a\
  \ surprisingly plaintive tone:\nDear Spleen-Boy, You will probably be surprised\
  \ at my plaintive tone, but I have been sobbing quite bitterly. I have had to take\
  \ refuge in a lair in the blue forgotten hills, because I learned that the coppers\
  \ wanted to have a word with me about the gruesome slayings at Sawdust Bridge. I\
  \ am woebegone and emotional and have pins and needles in various limbs as I huddle\
  \ here in the darkness, listening to the gruntings and howlings of creatures of\
  \ the night, some of which might discover my lair and attack your poor tearful Babinsky!\
  \ What is to become of me?\nFortunately, we know from other sources what became\
  \ of Babinsky after that. Even if we did not, a letter he wrote some three weeks\
  \ later sheds some light:\nHey there, Dot! By now you might have heard about the\
  \ coppers who were found dead in a pit in the blue forgotten hills, their heads\
  \ turned inside out by some inexplicable act of violence. Well, when they do the\
  \ forensics, it will be my great grubby thumb-prints they'll find. But what do I\
  \ care? I fled the scene as they gasped their last and am now quite safe, holed\
  \ up in a seaside boarding-house, plotting an enormity at the docks. If you could\
  \ see your way to stuffing some flies into an envelope and sending them to me, that\
  \ would be grand.\nBabinsky does not state why he wants an envelope stuffed with\
  \ flies. It may form part of his plot, or perhaps he is just being enigmatic, as\
  \ he is in this later letter, also addressed to Dot:\nDear Dot, I have been thinking\
  \ for some time now that you have signally failed to realise just how enigmatic\
  \ I am. This grieves me. You really need to appreciate that when I am not committing\
  \ gore-splattered killings or keeping up with my mole correspondence, I am just\
  \ about the most enigmatic person you are ever likely to receive a letter from.\
  \ Note, for instance, the exquisite notepaper, its edges trimmed with pinking shears,\
  \ its lavender-and-cauliflower scent, and the way I have folded it so that if you\
  \ cut along the creases you will have sixteen pieces which can be formed into a\
  \ lifelike paper model of David Blunkett's guide dog, complete with harness. PS:\
  \ Many thanks for sending the envelope stuffed with flies so promptly. I made very,\
  \ very enigmatic use of it, so enigmatic I am not going to tell you, in order to\
  \ preserve my considerable mystique.\nAt other times, Babinsky was more forthcoming\
  \ about his activities. In a letter to David Blunkett, he wrote:\nDear Mr Blunkett,\
  \ I would have you know that recently I have been creating lifelike paper models\
  \ of your guide dog, complete with harness. If you would like one, please let me\
  \ know, and I will send the template by return of post, unless of course I am forced\
  \ to flee from my current hidey-hole deep in the woods, sheltered by stark pines\
  \ and majestic laburnums. Everything is fine at the moment, but there is always\
  \ the possibility that I might betray my presence to the wizened old woodcutter\
  \ who dwells in a hovel a few yards away, and he looks like the sort who would summon\
  \ the coppers. They think I had something to do with the Unspeakable Stranglings\
  \ in Pointy Town last October, which I did, of course, but who's to know, eh? Keep\
  \ it under your hat, Mr Blunkett, if you have a hat, which I'm sure you do, being\
  \ a man of style and substance.\nBabinsky's own style and substance were occasionally\
  \ to be found in foreign parts. Now and then he sailed across the mighty and pitiless\
  \ sea, when, say, the police were hot on his trail, or he had it in mind to carry\
  \ out some foreign killings, or he wished to familiarise himself with the ways of\
  \ foreign moles. At these times, he kept up his correspondence with gusto, although\
  \ he had to make use of airmail, and therefore of thin airmail notepaper, of which\
  \ he did not approve.\nMy darling Blodwyn, I am sure you will agree that this airmail\
  \ paper is far too thin. I have a good mind to scrunch it up in my big hairy fist,\
  \ and then to calm myself down by going out and setting upon a foreign person and\
  \ visiting upon them an unimaginably horrible and violent death, possibly involving\
  \ pincers and bleach. Why can't they make the aeroplanes bigger, so they can carry\
  \ thicker paper? If I wasn't lying low from the polizei, I would march into a large\
  \ important building and demand something was done. But I need to keep out of sight,\
  \ and the snowdrifts outside this remote chalet are so deep that I would leave telltale\
  \ tracks, even if I just popped down to the jolly goatherd's hut to abduct one of\
  \ his goats. Thank Christ I put all that vegan nonsense behind me. I will have some\
  \ explaining to do when I am hauled before the tribunal of beasts, but I will hope\
  \ to distract them by allowing the gentle breeze in the dingly dell to waft my walrus\
  \ moustache to startling effect. That worked for me before, when I was about to\
  \ be arrested for the Cuxhaven Poisonings. Those Cuxhaven coppers were so bowled\
  \ over by the elegant quivering of my moustache that I was able to make my getaway\
  \ across the sandbanks.\nBabinsky did not always escape arrest, of course, and an\
  \ entire volume of the collected correspondence is entitled \u201CLetters From Prison\u201D\
  . Here is one of them:\nDear Yoko, I was born free, but now I am in chains. Please\
  \ take out full-page advertisements in all the major newspapers demanding my immediate\
  \ release, alongside whatever else you might wish for, such as world peace or no\
  \ possessions. We both know that you have global influence, and it will be a terrific\
  \ boost to your moral fibre to use that influence on behalf of a wretched prisoner\
  \ like me. So get with the programme, Missus!\nThis was not the only letter in which\
  \ Babinsky babbled about the boosting of fibre. It is a topic he returned to again\
  \ and again.\nDearest Ludovico, I've got some fibre here and I am going to give\
  \ it a boost. If you want to watch, meet me behind the gasworks at dead of night.\
  \ You will be able to recognise me by dint of my walrus moustache, lumbering gait,\
  \ the blood of a freshly-slaughtered goat dribbling down my chin, and my general\
  \ air of seething psychopathic violence. Don't tell anybody you're coming, and don't\
  \ make any plans for tomorrow, or, indeed, for the rest of your life, which I can\
  \ assure you is going to be particularly nasty, brutish, and short. PS: Give my\
  \ regards to your delightful wife and seven lovely children.\nIt is not often Babinsky\
  \ allows himself, as here, to show his tender, sentimental side. One of the pleasures\
  \ of this extraordinary collection is that we get to see the notorious killer in\
  \ the round, warts, more warts, and even more warts. The warts, of course, were\
  \ usually hidden under that majestic moustache. As he wrote to the Tod, or Ted,\
  \ or Tad we met earlier:\nDear Tod, I feel I must let you know that my warts are\
  \ mostly hidden under my majestic walrus moustache. Forever yours, Babinsky.\nSomehow,\
  \ those words serve as an epitaph of sorts.\n[2010-01-16]"
