text: "Why do fools fall in love? It is a question that has taxed the minds of great\
  \ thinkers throughout history. A notable investigation of our own era, by Lymon\
  \ in 1956, was perhaps hampered by his extreme youth and that of his research assistants.\
  \ It is true that some breakthroughs in the advance of human knowledge have been\
  \ made by youngsters, but in matters of the heart we may prefer to rely on the doddery\
  \ and decrepit, who are likely to have amassed valuable experience in the field.\n\
  Few are as doddery and decrepit as Nisbet Owlhead who, it is thrilling to learn,\
  \ is at long last on the brink of publishing his findings. Owlhead has been working\
  \ on this stuff for years, holed up in his top secret laboratory somewhere high\
  \ in the Swiss Alps. Some decades ago, he provided a glimpse into his working methods\
  \ in an article for The Rigorous And High-Minded Scientific Bulletin Of Lurve, reprinted\
  \ here without permission:\nIn order to find out why fools fall in love, we must\
  \ first obtain two fools. The easiest way to do this would be to go to Cretin Town\
  \ and drag off the street and bundle into the back of a van the first couple of\
  \ fools we encounter. So that is what I did. It is a very long way from Cretin Town\
  \ to my top secret laboratory somewhere high in the Swiss Alps, so I placed both\
  \ fools into an induced coma for the duration of the journey by van, train, forklift\
  \ truck, ship, another forklift truck, another van, another train, and finally funicular\
  \ railway.\nI installed the fools in a sealed but spacious chamber designed especially\
  \ for my purposes. Before bringing them out of their comas, I did a thorough investigation\
  \ of their brains, prodding at them with various instruments, to ascertain the precise\
  \ degree of foolishness. They were fools all right. I could not have been more pleased,\
  \ so before waking them I treated myself to a slap-up dinner at The Reeking Goat,\
  \ a Michelin-unstarred eaterie halfway down the mountain. The trough that night\
  \ was filled with delicious pap and slops, and I mixed easily with the regular clientele\
  \ of goatherds, peasants, and tubercular alpine invalids.\nBack in the lab, after\
  \ a post-prandial snooze and a few games of pingpong with my hunchbacked assistant,\
  \ Mungo, I set to work. I injected both fools with a wake-me-up potion, and then\
  \ retreated to my observation post outside the sealed chamber. After some minutes\
  \ the fools, as scientifically predicted, fooled about. I was so pleased I had another\
  \ slap-up dinner, another snooze, and further games of pingpong with Mungo.\nOn\
  \ St. Valentine's Day, I introduced into the chamber a box of chocolates. The following\
  \ year, I introduced a bunch of flowers. The third and most decisive intervention\
  \ came on the next St. Valentine's Day, when I placed in the chamber a cherubic,\
  \ winged, chubby, naked, curly-haired infant armed with a bow and arrow, which hovered\
  \ in the air above the fools.\nI have every confidence that true love will blossom\
  \ within that sealed chamber, and when it does I will be ready with my scanners\
  \ and bleepers and probes and buzzers and pointy things and all sorts of tiptop\
  \ scientific paraphernalia you could never begin to understand. Mungo keeps it all\
  \ polished to a gleam with his special rag.\nOwlhead celebrated his ninetieth birthday\
  \ last week with an announcement that he would publish his findings on St. Valentine's\
  \ Day 2018, or 2019, or, at a push, 2020.\nNext week in this series\_: What becomes\
  \ of the broken-hearted?\n[2017-07-26]"
