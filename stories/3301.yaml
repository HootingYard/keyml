  \ fiction:\n\u201CThis evening, I came across a one-two punch sort of death in a\
  \ Catholic novel, the Rev. Langton George Vere's For Better, Not For Worse (1882).\_\
  \ Early on, the novel's two female protagonists nearly tumble into a quarry; much\
  \ Flashing Neon Foreshadowing ensues.\_ At the end, the Honorable Laura Mapleson\
  \ shoots Lizzie, the younger of the two female protagonists, then chucks the body\
  \ into the nearest \u201Crippling stream\u201D (231)\u2026\_ Righteous smiting soon\
  \ follows.\_ Laura, who apparently failed to look where she was going, stumbles\
  \ into a nest of wasps, and is quickly beset by \u201Cinfuriated insects\u201D (231).\_\
  \ While trying to rid herself of the aforementioned insects, the Flashing Neon Foreshadowing\
  \ kicks in, and Laura \u201Clay a bruised and bleeding mass of humanity in the darksome\
  \ depth of the old disused quarry, where her victim, the palefaced girl, had stood\
  \ and shuddered, as she thought of the horror of a fall into that dreadful darkness!\u201D\
