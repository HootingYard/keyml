  \ every last chock\u2014the one under the draining board, the one beside the bathroom\
  \ radiator, the many and various chocks scattered higgledy-piggledy wherever I cast\
  \ my myopic gaze. Do bear in mind that I am not talking about chocs, as in chocolates.\
  \ I mean chocks. If you are not sure what I am talking about, go and siphon out\
