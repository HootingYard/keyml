text: 'You all know by now that there are untold hours of the sound of Mr Key babbling
  into a microphone available from the ResonanceFM Hooting Yard podcast hub. What
  may not be clear is that this treasure trove of twaddle is made available to you
  through the tireless work of unsung yet heroic figures who actually have a grasp
  of whizzbang 21st century technology (unlike Mr Key). So today I want to pay tribute
  to the current podcast maestro Marvin Suicide, in particular for his choice of photographic
  illustrations to each programme. This week, for the story Pancake Hints, he has
  excelled himself. Isn''t this fantastic?


  Acknowledgements are also due to the source of the photograph, one Slimmer Jimmer,
  whose work can be found here.
