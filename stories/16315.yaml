text: "The orchard gull is a bird I remember from my childhood. It was often to be\
  \ seen perched on the railings around the plot of what once had been a thriving\
  \ orchard, now overgrown with weeds and nettles. The trees were dead or dying. The\
  \ gull was alive and raucous.\nIt was a one-legged gull, its other leg a stump,\
  \ having suffered a catastrophic bird injury. I admired its ability to balance on\
  \ the railings. I admired, too, its inhuman savagery. Birds are not like us, not\
  \ at all.\nAt a loose end one day when Harold Wilson was prime minister, I fashioned\
  \ a doll orchard gull from a wire coathanger and cloth and rags and cotton wool\
  \ and pipe-cleaners. I used lollipop sticks for the legs, snapping two-thirds off\
  \ the length of one to represent the stump.\nI finished making the doll at ten o\u2019\
  \ clock in the morning, and went mincing off along the lane towards the orchard.\
  \ I placed my doll on the railings, near to where the orchard gull often perched,\
  \ though there was no sign of it that morning.\nWhen I returned home, my Ma and\
  \ Pa were discussing the death, recently announced, a month short of her ninetieth\
  \ birthday, of Alice B Toklas. I remember how they got into a spat about her middle\
  \ name. Pa swore it was Blossom, while Ma was sure it was Babette. Ma was right,\
  \ but it was several days before she was able to claim victory, when the mobile\
  \ library, with its reference books, came to our neck of the woods.\nLate that afternoon\
  \ I returned to the orchard to see how my gull doll was getting along. As I approached\
  \ the railings, I saw that it had been rent asunder, torn to shreds, clearly with\
  \ inhuman savagery. The orchard gull itself was nowhere to be seen, but I had no\
  \ doubt it had attacked and destroyed my doll.\nIt pained me that the orchard gull\
  \ had, plainly, loathed its likeness. I gathered up the few stray remnants of coathanger\
  \ and cloth and rags and cotton wool and pipe-cleaners and lollipop sticks and returned\
  \ home, resolved to make a more flattering replica.\n[2018-03-06]"
