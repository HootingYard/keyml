text: "I must admit to being perplexed at my uninspired state. I have been tapping\
  \ the keyboard in a desultory way before abandoning the few lines of guff that result,\
  \ or, more commonly in recent days, feeling a reluctance even to begin tapping.\
  \ And the reason I am puzzled is that much of my reading, at the moment, is of a\
  \ writer whom I find fantastically inspiring.\nI decided to immerse myself in the\
  \ eight volumes of Fors Clavigera after coming across Guy Davenport's lament that\
  \ nowadays, hardly anyone reads John Ruskin. Well, I had never read him, and I thought\
  \ I would have to fight my way through these ninety-six letters \u201Cto the workmen\
  \ and labourers of Great Britain\u201D (one each month for eight years), the reading\
  \ being a challenge rather than a pleasure. Ah, but what a pleasure lay in store\u2014\
  and still does, as I am currently just halfway through volume five.\nRuskin is a\
  \ magnificent writer, not least in his ability to veer off at unexpected angles.\
  \ One minute he will be ranting about the iniquities of industrialisation, then\
  \ he will launch into a transcription of what he readily admits is a fairly dull\
  \ folk story about Swiss peasants, before reminding himself that he meant to write\
  \ about glacier theory.\n\u201CIf only the Rev. James McCosh were here!\u201D begins\
  \ a paragraph, for no apparent reason. I adore the surprise and the sheer ease of\
  \ his prose. You can sense the whirrings of the gigantic and eccentric Ruskin-brain\
  \ as he flits from topic to topic, but somehow never quite gets lost. He writes\
  \ about barging into someone's cottage to wish a happy new year \u201Cto whoever\
  \ was there\u201D, has some thoughts on the proper education of children, and suddenly\
  \ embarks on a sustained passage about the nature of bees, what he does and doesn't\
  \ know about them, and pauses to rummage among his bookcases looking up bee information\
  \ in Bingley, Cassell, Petter, Galpin, and Ormerod. The latter's History Of Wasps,\
  \ he decides, ought to be a standard book in the primary education of girls.\nAm\
  \ I so awestruck by Ruskin that his prose intimidates rather than inspires me? I\
  \ don't think that's the case. Anyway, I have regular fads and enthusiasms for writers.\
  \ I once read about a dozen novels by Nabokov one after another, in a frenzy, with\
  \ no ill effects. So I shall remain vaguely perplexed, but try my best to start\
  \ tapping away again with bluster and vim. If all else fails, I shall have to summon\
  \ the phantom of the Rev. James McCosh from out of the shadows.\n[2009-05-24]"
