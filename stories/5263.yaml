text: "Flares. That's right, flares. And not just any old flares, but solar flares,\
  \ up in the heavens, immense and dazzling. Solar flares due to create a space storm\
  \ that could incapacitate the infrastructure of civilisation on earth. Or, as The\
  \ Sun puts it, excitingly, \u201Ccould turn the sky red, wipe internet and paralyse\
  \ Earth\u201D.\nThese world-shuddering solar flares were an item on last night's\
  \ Channel Four News. In spite of the fact that these huge explosions of energy from\
  \ the sun which could crash electricity grids and paralyse the earth are due to\
  \ occur in just three years\u2019 time, the story was not the main headline. Nor\
  \ even the second or third. In fact, it came at the tail-end of the bulletin, the\
  \ place one might expect to be told about a skateboarding duck or a pancake bearing\
  \ the face of Christ.\nHas it come to this? The destruction of civilisation is considered\
  \ to be of lesser account than Nick Clegg? Yes, yes, we know Clegg smokes and idolises\
  \ Samuel Beckett and weeps when he listens to the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss,\
  \ but remember, too, that Chris Mullin, a man of (I think) some integrity, who still\
  \ watches television in black-and-white, describes him as \u201Ceasily the biggest\
  \ charlatan of the lot\u201D.\nThe terrifying thing is that, if two-thirds of the\
  \ skies will indeed be smothered in a blood-red aurora, what will become of Hooting\
  \ Yard? Let's get our priorities right. The Lib Dem party conference may be of interest\
  \ to smoking Beckettian Straussist charlatans and their hangers-on, but any sane\
  \ person would be preparing themselves for a hideous new dispensation of pre-industrial\
  \ scavenging, untold savagery, and silence like unto death itself falling upon Dobson\
  \ and Blodgett and Tiny Enid and Pebblehead and all your Hooting Yard favourites.\
  \ Surely even Krishnan Guru-Murthy can grasp the horrifying implications.\nThere\
  \ is a crumb of comfort, I suppose, in the likelihood that we will reach the end\
  \ of our alphabetic postage series long before 2013.\n[2010-09-21]"
