  Regular readers will be aware that whenever I quote from George Orwell''s diaries
  I give the full and unabridged entry for the day in question. Tomorrow we will have
  to move on to a different diarist, so it is only fair that I take the opportunity
  to draw your attention to further, ornithologically significant, excitements in
  Orwell''s life which took place on the ninth of January 1939. Not merely

  Two eggs

  but

  Saw large flock of green plover, apparently the same as in England.

  Did he think foreign plovers would somehow differ from clean, decent, English plovers?
