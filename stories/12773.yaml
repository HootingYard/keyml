text: 'The importance of Scroggins lies in its custody. Not one cupboard, but two,
  are necessary, each fitted with a heavy padlock. The keys should differ from each
  other in minute yet decisive particulars and be kept secreted at the bottom of the
  garden, hanging from the branches of a pugton tree, disguised with tinsel or birdlime
  so that they appear to be organic growths upon the tree. The tree itself ought to
  be fenced off with railings, railings with spikes, spikes!, sharpened spikes. Only
  then can Scroggins be said to be held securely. If you wish to allow visiting times,
  make them at dead of night, in mist or fog, with full documentation. Have a dog,
  too, one that howls. Ignore the distant beating of drums. Drums are the playthings
  of toddlers.
