text: "When Kew. Rhone. was released by Virgin Records back in 1977, it was somewhat\
  \ overshadowed by another record issued by the label on the very same day\u2014\
  Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols. The influence of John Lydon's band\
  \ was immeasurable, prompting thousands of snotty and not-so-snotty teenagers to\
  \ form their own groups and make their own racket. Kew. Rhone. had far fewer adherents,\
  \ but it had a decisive influence on some, not least on Mr Key himself. Along with\
  \ Edward Gorey, Kew. Rhone.\u2018s lyricist and illustrator Peter Blegvad was my\
  \ teenage self's great creative spur, firing my imagination in ways that have not\
  \ yet fully worked themselves out.\nAlmost four decades on, Kew. Rhone. is now a\
  \ book, and one which I urge every last one of you lot to add to your shelves. It\
  \ is with a certain amount of overexcitement that I tell you I am one of the contributors,\
  \ so quite apart from its many other charms, the book is a necessary purchase for\
  \ all devoted Hooting Yardists. Here is the press release:\nFirst released in 1977,\
  \ Kew. Rhone. is an album by a mismatched assortment of musicians performing intricate\
  \ jazz- and pop-inflected songs with lyrics about unlikely subjects and unlikelier\
  \ objects, lyrics which refer to diagrams or function as footnotes, or are based\
  \ on anagrams and palindromes.\nKew. Rhone. would never trouble the charts, it aspired\
  \ to higher things, and yet, re-released in various formats over the decades, curiosity\
  \ about this categorically elusive work has grown. Now its authors and some of its\
  \ connoisseurs have broken silence to discuss the record and to reflect upon the\
  \ times in which it and they themselves were forged.\nPeter Blegvad, Kew. Rhone.'s\
  \ lyricist and illustrator, excavates each song in turn, uncovering themes and sources.\
  \ In the second part of the book, a consortium of writers and artists respond to\
  \ the album in various ways, illuminating without dispelling the mystery of a work\
  \ designed to resist interpretation even as it invites it.\nWith contributions from:\
  \ Amy Beal, Carla Bley, Franklin Bruno, Sheridan Coakley, Jonathan Coe, Jane Colling,\
  \ Andrew Cyrille, Fran\xE7ois Ducat, John Greaves, Doug Harvey, Lisa Herman, Jeff\
  \ Hoke, Dana Johnson, Andrew Joron, Glenn Kenny, Frank Key, Simon Lucas, Karen Mantler,\
  \ Harry Mathews, Tanya Peixoto, Benjamin Piekut, Margit Rosen, Philip Tagney, Robert\
  \ Wyatt, Rafi Zabor and Siegfried Zielinski.\nKew. Rhone. is published by Uniform\
  \ Books on 26 November.\n\n[2014-11-07]"
