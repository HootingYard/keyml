text: "The British explorer Percy Fawcett vanished in the Amazon jungle, along with\
  \ his son Jack and a friend of Jack's, in 1925. Fawcett was searching for the remains\
  \ of an ancient mythical (and mystical) city he called Z. Over the following years,\
  \ many attempts were made to find him\u2026\nMany Brazilians told us that, over\
  \ the past few decades, religious cults had spring up in the area that worshipped\
  \ Fawcett as a kind of god. They believed that Fawcett had entered a network of\
  \ underground tunnels and discovered that Z was, of all things, a portal to another\
  \ reality. Even though Brian Fawcett had concealed his father's bizarre writings\
  \ at the end of his life, these mystics had seized upon Fawcett's few cryptic references,\
  \ in magazines such as the Occult Review, to his search for \u201Cthe treasures\
  \ of the invisible World\u201D. These writings, coupled with Fawcett's disappearance\
  \ and the failure of anyone over the years to discover his remains, fuelled the\
  \ notion that he had somehow defied the laws of physics.\nOne sect, called the Magical\
  \ Nucleus, was started, in 1968, by a man named Udo Luckner, who referred to himself\
  \ as the High Priest of the Roncador and wore a long white gown and a cylindrical\
  \ hat with a Star of David. In the 1970s, scores of Brazilians and Europeans, including\
  \ Fawcett's great-nephew, flocked to join the Magical Nucleus, hoping to find this\
  \ portal. Luckner built a religious compound by the Roncador Mountains, where families\
  \ were forbidden to eat meat or wear jewelry. Luckner predicted that the world would\
  \ end in 1982 and said that his people must prepare to descend into the hollow earth.\
  \ But, when the planet remained in existence, the Magical Nucleus gradually disbanded.\n\
