text: "Oh glorious Mr Key! writes Tim Thurn\u2014is he being obsequious or sarcastic?\
  \ It's hard to tell\u2014It was fascinating to read about the retired blacksmiths\
  \ Bim, Bam, and Nat yesterday, and I was wondering if you had any further information\
  \ about them.\nWell, I don't, Tim, but I know a man who does, as they say. For no\
  \ less a blockbusterist than Pebblehead has recently published a thumping great\
  \ triple biography, entitled Retired Blacksmiths! The True Story Of Bim And Bam\
  \ And Nat, and a cracking good read it is. In fact, it was my source for that business\
  \ about the goblin colour coding, a full account of which appears in Chapter XXXVIII,\
  \ and then again, almost word for word, in Chapter XCIV. One could be forgiven for\
  \ thinking that Pebblehead completely forgot what he had written earlier. It would\
  \ not be the first time. Whole swathes of his potted history of jugged hare recipes,\
  \ Jugged!, are repeated more than once in the book, having already appeared in earlier\
  \ volumes in the Pebblehead oeuvre, one a history of jugs and the other an encyclopaedia\
  \ of hares. This is why he is dismissed as a hack.\nHack or no, you or I would sell\
  \ our grandmother's bones to achieve his sales figures. Retired Blacksmiths! has\
  \ only been in the shops for a week, and has already sold more copies than there\
  \ are visible stars in the sky. And deservedly so, for in spite of the fact that\
  \ his prose is repetitive and slapdash and descends at times into mawkishness, Pebblehead\
  \ wrings from his subjects a tale well worth the telling.\nWe learn, for example,\
  \ about the lives of the threesome before their retirement. There is Bim, at the\
  \ random grim forge, fettling for a great grey drayhorse his bright and battering\
  \ sandal! And there is Bam, also at a random grim forge, also fettling. And Nat,\
  \ too, at the next forge along the lane, and he too fettling, as the sun beats down\
  \ on a rustic scene redolent of Lark Rise To Candleford. Pebblehead gives us so\
  \ much detail about random grim forges and the fettling of bright and battering\
  \ sandals for great grey drayhorses that the reader could, with confidence, given\
  \ an anvil and a few tools, set up their own smithy's. I did, before I had even\
  \ finished reading the book. Clang clang clang, that was the sound clanging from\
  \ my chalet, as sparks flew and a line of great grey drayhorses formed outside,\
  \ awaiting their bright and battering sandals. My neighbours were a great help,\
  \ filling nosebags with hay for the horses, combing their manes, and brushing their\
  \ fetlocks with horse-brushes. So busy was I fettling and smithying that I did not\
  \ have any time to finish reading Pebblehead's book, though my place is marked.\
  \ I marked it, not with a standard bookmark, of flimsy cardboard, but with a great\
  \ iron slab, beaten flat upon my anvil, bright and battering.\nSo I have not yet\
  \ read beyond the point where, newly retired, Bim and Bam and Nat are co-opted onto\
  \ the World Council of Goblins and set to work on their colour coding scheme. A\
  \ scan of the contents page, however, suggests that there are thrills and spills\
  \ aplenty still to come, including Bim's involvement in the Profumo affair, Bam\
  \ taking a dip in the Bosphorus, and Nat choking on a mouthful of genetically-modified\
  \ spinach. When I have finished fettling all those great grey drayhorses lined up\
  \ along the lane, waiting patiently, patiently, I shall return to the book, and\
  \ tell you what more I learn about the three retired blacksmiths, their doings,\
  \ their dreams, their pangs, and their dotage.\n[2011-01-20]"
