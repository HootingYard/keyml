text: "When I was first invited to present a show on ResonanceFM, way back in 2004,\
  \ my immediate enthusiasm was tempered by a certain anxiety. I was fretful that\
  \ perhaps I did not have a \u201Cradio voice\u201D, and that, as soon as I was stuck\
  \ in front of a microphone, I would screech like a screech-owl. Listeners would\
  \ lunge towards the off-button, desperate to stop the hideous caterwauling and lapse\
  \ into blessed silence. So before accepting the offer, I took myself off to an elocutionist.\n\
  Miss Blossom Christsblood's establishment was on the top floor of a tall and ramshackle\
  \ and quite possibly condemned building in an insalubrious part of town. It did\
  \ not enjoy a lift, and by the time I had lugged myself up the stairs I was breathless\
  \ and panting. Before she even said hello, Miss Blossom was intent on exacting payment\
  \ from me, in cash, for my first lesson. I emptied my pockets of coinage, which\
  \ she immediately squirrelled away in what looked like a battered tobacco tin.\n\
  I was given to understand that my lesson would begin when I stopped panting, which\
  \ I duly did several minutes later. During this time, Miss Blossom paid no attention\
  \ to me whatsoever, but busied herself with her birds, innumerable birds housed\
  \ in innumerable birdcages hanging from innumerable rafters. I am no ornithologist,\
  \ but I think at least one of them was a screech-owl.\nEventually my lesson began.\n\
  \u201CWhen speaking aloud,\u201D announced Miss Blossom, in a screech, \u201CThe\
  \ most important thing is the formation of the vole sounds.\u201D\nIt was at this\
  \ point I decided to cut my losses and leave. Over a decade has passed since that\
  \ unfortunate episode. In that time, I have continued to present Hooting Yard On\
  \ The Air every week, with the occasional lacuna, and I do not think that at any\
  \ time I have found it necessary to imitate the sound of a vole, nor a beaver, nor\
  \ a shrew, nor even an otter.\n[2015-02-01]"
