text: "I went to the greengrocer's and bought a bag of weird oranges. I say bag, but\
  \ it was really a net, spun from some kind of red synthetic fibre, fastened with\
  \ a dinky metal clasp. The net contained, by my reckoning, half a dozen oranges.\
  \ And weird they were, though my intention had been to buy blood oranges. I was\
  \ persuaded by the patter of the greengrocer to take the weird ones instead. The\
  \ curious thing about his patter was that, by the time I was a few yards along the\
  \ street, clutching my net, on my way to the park, I was unable to recall a single\
  \ word of it. Why was I carrying weird oranges instead of the blood oranges I had\
  \ wanted? I had no idea, but nor did I seem able to retrace my steps. I hurried\
  \ on towards the gates of the park as if impelled by a force outwith my perception.\n\
  Arriving at the park, I made my way to my usual bench anent the duckpond. The ducks\
  \ looked forlorn and ill-tempered. I discovered that it was impossible to unfasten\
  \ the clasp on the net with my bare hands. It was, as I said, dinky, about the size\
  \ of say eight standard stationery staples impacted together laterally. I picked\
  \ at it with my fingernails but could get no purchase. I then tried to tear a slit\
  \ in the net itself. God knows what the fibres were made of. Whatever it was resisted\
  \ my increasingly energetic attempts to rend it. I gave up when my fingers were\
  \ red with bloody stripes and my hands were shaking.\nMy plan had been\u2014oh,\
  \ it hardly matters, does it?, now it was so plainly abortive. In any case, I reflected,\
  \ as I sat on the bench panting from my exertions, my plan probably would not have\
  \ succeeded anyway, since I had been coaxed into buying weird oranges instead of\
  \ blood oranges, the latter being a crucial element in the plan. A teal\u2014or\
  \ it might have been a merganser\u2014paddled to the edge of the duckpond and fixed\
  \ me with a look of reproach. I spat on the ground, and kept on spitting, until\
  \ I had exhausted my phlegm.\nThen I went a-trudging, without aim or purpose, through\
  \ the park and along the lane past the railway sidings, up into the hills, those\
  \ damnable pointy hills. I left the net of weird oranges on the park bench, from\
  \ which they were snaffled, before the day's end, by a wolf. It was a weird wolf,\
  \ so at least there was some kind of neatness to what was otherwise a most jambly-jumbly\
  \ day.\n[2014-08-04]"
