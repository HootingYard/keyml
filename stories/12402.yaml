text: "\nToday the Guardian yet again employs the preposterous Russell Brand as a\
  \ commentator. This time his overwritten wittering is about the death of Philip\
  \ Seymour Hoffman, which gives the \u201Calleged comedian\u201D (\xA9\_Peter Hitchens)\
  \ another opportunity to tell us that he is a recovering addict. Well, who knew?\
  \ He may indeed be recovering from drink and drugs, but I think it's time he sought\
  \ help for his pitiable addiction to babbling on and on about himself. Several decades\
  \ in a Trappist monastery would be ideal.\nWhich brings us to the more important\
  \ topic of Mr Key, or rather to his cupboard in The Dabbler, which today contains\
  \ a piece about the role played by comedians in the governance of Britain. Warning:\
  \ I am afraid Brand is mentioned there again\u2014I really must get a grip!\u2014\
  though only in passing, and you lot will be able to sluice him out of your brains\
  \ by contemplating, instead, such stars of yesteryear as Wilson, Keppel, and Betty.\n\
