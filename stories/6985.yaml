text: "The 2011 Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest awards have been announced, and there\
  \ is some terrific\u2014that is, awful\u2014stuff duly honoured. Go here for the\
  \ winners and runners-up.\nThere is one passage that, to my mind, doesn't belong\
  \ in the list. I would have been proud to write the sentence that made Mike Mayfield\
  \ the runner-up in the Adventure category. Far from being \u201Cbad\u201D writing\
  \ (deliberately or otherwise), I think this is superb, and rather Hooting Yardy:\n\
  Sensing somehow a scudding lay in the offing, Skipper Bob tallied his tasks: reef\
  \ the mains'l, mizzen, and jib, strike and brail the fores'l, mizzen stays'l and\
  \ baggywrinkles, bowse the halyards, mainsheets, jacklines and vangs, turtle and\
  \ belay fast the small cock, flemish the taffrail warps, batten the booby hatch,\
  \ lay by his sou'wester, and find the bailing bucket.\nLong long ago, when I was\
  \ wet behind the ears, I wrote a story which began: \u201COh, I so wanted this to\
  \ be a seafaring yarn.\u201D Then and now, I could learn a thing or two from Mike\
  \ Mayfield.\nUPDATE\_: Readers who follow the link to By Aerostat To Hooting Yard\
  \ and read it for the first time should note that the Dobson in the story is completely\
  \ unrelated to that well-loved character Dobson the out of print pamphleteer. \_\
  Just so you know.\n[2011-07-26]"
