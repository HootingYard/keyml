text: 'On yesterday''s radio show I played the Hooting Yard Chant, in a simple version
  for two voices. It has now been given an audio going-over by Outa_Spaceman, and
  sounds quite formidable. Put it on repeat and use it as the soundtrack to your day.

  Hooting Yard! Hooting Yard! Ha-ha and gazebo! We will vanquish all our foes! Where
  have all the flowers gone? Hooting! Hooting Yard!

  Chant
