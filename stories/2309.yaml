text: "According to the visitor statistics, someone arrived at Hooting Yard yesterday\
  \ having searched for the term \u201Cmacabre folding camp chairs\u201D. I hasten\
  \ to add that I am not making this up. I suspect what the inquirer was looking for\
  \ was Dobson's exceedingly rare Eerie & Macabre Picnic Praxis, a set of practical\
  \ guidelines which appeared, oddly, as an appendix to his pamphlet A Dictionary\
  \ Of Squirrels (out of print).\nUnusually for Dobson, the Praxis was written in\
  \ response to a request from a reader. The pamphleteer was notoriously dismissive,\
  \ even contemptuous, of his audience, such as it was. Marigold Chew recalls the\
  \ great man stamping about in his study, spitting into the fireplace, shouting his\
  \ head off at nobody in particular and insisting that his readership was composed\
  \ of spiteful lickspittles and human wreckage. He had no evidence to back this claim,\
  \ of course. He just enjoyed his misanthropic ravings, as who does not?\nWe must\
  \ wonder, then, why the pamphleteer responded with such alacrity to the letter he\
  \ received from a correspondent signing himself simply as \u201CJFK\u201D. There\
  \ are compelling reasons to believe this was the soon-to-be-assassinated thirty-fifth\
  \ Potus, but that is unlikely to have impressed Dobson, who had a weird animus towards\
  \ men who wore surgical braces for excruciating back pain. A devotee of the \u201C\
  back quack\u201D Rastus Tebbit, whom he occasionally visited in prison, Dobson swore\
  \ by the old fraud's patent back pain remedy of lettuce, toad, and cake.\nThe letter\
  \ itself was clear and concise. Dear Dobson, it read, I am planning to organise\
  \ a picnic outing that will be both eerie and macabre, but I have no idea how to\
  \ go about it. It has been suggested to me by one of my secret service agents that\
  \ a pamphleteer such as yourself would be able to bash together some guidelines\
  \ at the drop of a hat. Thanks in advance.\nIt has been estimated that throughout\
  \ his long career, Dobson received no fewer than eight direct requests from readers\
  \ to address a particular topic. The other seven were binned or burned or torn to\
  \ shreds or, on one memorable occasion, folded into a paper aeroplane of uncommonly\
  \ aerodynamic soundness and launched from atop an Alpine peak into the blue empyrean,\
  \ to the applause of a gaggle of Swiss boy scouts. Yet this one letter stirred something\
  \ in the pamphleteer's brain, and he immediately sat down at his escritoire and\
  \ took a newly-sharpened pencil from his pencil pot and wrote the Praxis, it is\
  \ thought in a single burst of concentrated picnic prose. The subject, it should\
  \ be remembered, was one familiar to him, for he had written teeming pages on picnics\
  \ in earlier years. Indeed, one of the first pamphlets ever to bear Dobson's name\
  \ was entitled God Almighty, Is There Anything More Satisfying Than A Well-Executed\
  \ Picnic? (out of print).\nAs mysterious as the enthusiasm with which he tackled\
  \ a reader's request, however, is the fact that, as soon as the Praxis was written,\
  \ Dobson shoved it into a cardboard box and forgot about it. Within days, the manuscript\
  \ was covered with other scribblings, and with biscuit crumbs and dust and spilled\
  \ talcum powder and a cackhandedly-folded map of guillemot habitats and shells from\
  \ a packet of brazil nuts and newspaper cuttings and a hiking boot catalogue until\
  \ the box was full and its lid was fitted and it was consigned to a shelf in the\
  \ cellar alongside dozens upon dozens of other cardboard boxes filled with a heteroclite\
  \ jumble of forgotten miscellania. This habitual Dobsonian practice has proved infuriating\
  \ for scholars. Perhaps it really would have been better if the whole damned lot\
  \ had been burned to a cinder.\nAlmost a decade passed. One Thursday afternoon,\
  \ during a thunderstorm, Marigold Chew remarked to Dobson that his Dictionary Of\
  \ Squirrels, which she was readying for print, would, in her opinion, be immeasurably\
  \ enriched by the addition of a few more pages. But Dobson had exhausted his knowledge\
  \ of squirrels, and had nothing more to say. By chance, he was rummaging about searching\
  \ for the map of guillemot habitats, in preparation for his next project, A Dictionary\
  \ Of Guillemot Habitat Maps, and, grabbing at the Praxis, he tossed it over to Marigold,\
  \ muttering something along the lines of it being a \u201Ccompanion piece\u201D\
  . This was nonsense, of course, for it is nothing of the sort. Squirrels are not\
  \ even mentioned in its sixteen brief paragraphs. Marigold was skim-reading it,\
  \ and about to protest that Dobson was fobbing her off with a non-squirrel-related\
  \ text, when there was an almighty clap of thunder and both the pamphleteer and\
  \ his inamorata were stricken with sudden terrific clap of thunder shock syndrome.\
  \ Dazed and bumbling, Dobson then made things worse by insisting they both take\
  \ Rastus Tebbit's so-called \u201Ccurative\u201D, a potion of toad, cake and radish,\
  \ the only effect of which was to unhinge their reason for a period of forty-eight\
  \ hours. It was during this time, with her judgement impaired, that Marigold Chew\
  \ printed all known copies of the Dictionary Of Squirrels, with its wholly irrelevant\
  \ appendix.\nShould we be glad she did so? The Eerie & Macabre Picnic Praxis is\
  \ a curious work, and it is hard to see how practical the guidelines are if one\
  \ is actually intent upon organising an eerie and macabre picnic. Paragraph six,\
  \ for example, the one I think my visitor from yesterday was searching for, reads\
  \ as follows:\nMost reputable stockists of folding camp chairs will be happy to\
  \ listen to any requests from you regarding eerie or macabre ranges of their merchandise.\
  \ They will listen happily because they tend, as a tribe, to be happy, even when\
  \ faced by plague and cataclysm. I know this much because I have seen them laugh\
  \ hysterically at an approaching swarm of locusts, on more than one occasion.\n\
  As Aloysius Nestingbird, that most temperate of Dobsonists, asked, after reading\
  \ this passage, \u201CWhat in heaven's name is he blathering on about?\u201D To\
  \ date, no one has given a satisfactory answer to that question.\n[2009-04-17]"
