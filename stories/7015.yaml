text: "A life-size marzipan wolf makes a splendid teatime treat at gatherings of the\
  \ extended family. For smaller kinship grouplets, it can be portioned up and served\
  \ piecemeal after supper over several days, or even weeks, depending on the portion\
  \ sizes.\nThe first thing to do is to commandeer the kitchen, together with any\
  \ adjacent pantries, larders and icehouses. If you employ skivvies, drive them out,\
  \ with a broom if necessary. They can busy themselves awhile in an outbuilding or\
  \ annexe, or you can just dismiss them, with or without character references. Bear\
  \ in mind, however, that when you have finished making your life-size marzipan wolf\
  \ you will probably want the skivvies back in the kitchen, toiling through all the\
  \ hours God sends, so whatever you decide to do, treat them with kindness, or at\
  \ least what passes for kindness in your bleak forbidding grim authoritarian household.\n\
  Next, acquire a large glob of marzipan. It should be at least the size, if not the\
  \ shape, of an average adult wolf. If you are not sure what that is, make study\
  \ of wolves, for example by combing through reference books, preferably illustrated,\
  \ by watching informative documentary films at the local fleapit, or by stalking\
  \ the heaths and moors at dead of night. Remember that in moonlight it can be difficult\
  \ to judge distance, so get as close to any pack of heath or moorland wolves as\
  \ you possibly can. Wear dark clothing and night-vision goggles, if they are available\
  \ in your neck of the woods.\nOnce you are alone in your kitchen with a wolf-size\
  \ glob of marzipan on the countertop, you can proceed to mould it into the shape\
  \ of a wolf. The basic idea is to go for absolute verisimilitude, so that the members\
  \ of your extended family or smaller kinship grouplet do a double-take.\n\u201C\
  My oh my! What on earth is a wolf doing, sitting there without a care in the world\
  \ on an enormous cake-stand in the middle of the dining table?\u201D they will exclaim,\
  \ before blinking a couple of times and adding, \u201COh! Silly me! Look, it is\
  \ all yellow and made out of marzipan!\u201D\nIt can be a very tricky effect to\
  \ pull off successfully, especially if you are cack-handed. Nor should you even\
  \ begin the project if you are suffering from delirium tremens or from any other\
  \ condition which causes you to shake uncontrollably, such as having recently spent\
  \ five hours atop a vibrating platform or watched a terrifying non-documentary film\
  \ about spooks and ghosties and monsters at the local fleapit.\nSteady-handed, then,\
  \ mould the marzipan accordingly, and place it on the aforementioned enormous cake-stand\
  \ in the middle of your dining table. You are now ready to throw open the doors\
  \ of the dining room and beckon your extended family or smaller kinship grouplet,\
  \ who will be lounging around in the parlour glugging sherry and exchanging anecdotes,\
  \ or, if puritanical, as they probably are given the bleak forbidding grim authoritarian\
  \ nature of your household, sipping from tumblers of tap water and frowning in silence.\n\
  Bon appetit!\n[2011-07-29]"
