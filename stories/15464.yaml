text: 'This piece first appeared in 2010. I am reposting it today for reasons which
  I am sure will be obvious to the woolly-brained among you.

  If you are a certain type of folk singer, or vicar, or countryside rambler, you
  will as likely as not be wearing a jumper or sweater or pullover made of wool. It
  may conceivably be a polo neck. You more than anyone will know that there is good
  wool and there is bad wool. I would go so far as to say that, in the matter of wool,
  there is no middle ground, no grey area. Either the wool is good, or it is bad,
  and there''s an end on''t.

  If your jumper or sweater or pullover has been knitted from good wool, you should
  count your blessings. Depending on where you live, good wool can be hard to come
  by. You may have had to send away to some far distant woolly apparel concern to
  have one of their catalogue items delivered to you through the mails, in a packet.
  The costs of transportation and packaging will have added to the basic price of
  your chosen jumper or sweater or pullover, but the outlay is justified when it is
  guaranteed that the knitwork was done with good wool.

  But woe betide you if for some reason you are forced to wear something made from
  bad wool. Bad wool comes from bad sheep. They may be diseased, or repugnant, or
  unseemly, or all three. That does not stop unscrupulous shearers from shearing the
  wool from them and selling it on to equally unscrupulous wool merchants, who in
  turn have it processed and knitted into garments. It is both sad and astounding
  what reserves of human skill can be deployed into making something out of bad wool.
  Spotting a garment on a market stall, or for sale from the barrow of a barrow boy,
  it may not be immediately apparent whether the wool is good wool or bad wool. It
  may not even become evident when you put it on, pulling it over your head and inserting
  your arms and tucking it about yourself. But if it is made from bad wool it will
  contaminate you, as surely as night follows day. That is the thing about garb knitted
  from bad wool. The knitting was bad and the garb is bad, because of the bad wool.
  And, disporting it upon your frame, sashaying along the boulevards of your faubourg,
  it will make you bad too.

  It is a wonder that bad wool has not been made illegal. Perhaps there are happy
  lands where that is the case. Is that not a pleasing thought, a happy land where
  all the wool is good, and none of it bad? Alas, it is an impossible dream. For there
  will always be bad sheep, and bad shearers, and unscrupulous merchants, and ne''er-do-well
  traders and barrow boys.

  Hence, if you are wearing good wool, I repeat, count your blessings, count them
  until kingdom come, and then count them over again. And if you are wearing bad wool,
  reflect upon the circumstance, ask what you have done to deserve bad wool. It is
  likely that you have brought the bad wool upon yourself, through your own contamination,
  for bad attracts bad, in persons and wool as in other phenomena of the boundless
  universe.
