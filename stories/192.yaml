text: "If you spend a bit of time thinking about the matter, it becomes apparent that\
  \ human ingenuity has created a myriad of pastes. At one end of the spectrum are\
  \ thick pastes, tacky to the touch, and at the other are pastes so runny that they\
  \ are akin to goo. There are other ways of thinking about the variety of pastes\
  \ other than the thick-to-thin or tacky-to-goo spectrum, but they have less appeal.\
  \ Why is this? Not surprisingly, it is a question to which Dobson once turned his\
  \ magnificent pamphlet-writing brain.\nIt has to be said that the resulting fourteen-page\
  \ essay is one of his less engaging works. Fancying that he might win some kudos\
  \ with the scientific community, Dobson splattered his text with technical terminology\
  \ of which he had no grasp whatsoever. It has been reported that up and down the\
  \ land laboratory cafeterias rang with laughter as boffins digested a Gestetnered\
  \ draft of the pamphlet which Dobson had circulated ahead of publication. In the\
  \ event, Tacky To Goo\_: Some Frightfully Complicated Thoughts On The Consistency\
  \ Of Manufactured Pastes was only ever issued in this scrappy format, cranked out\
  \ in the potting shed by Marigold Chew as an act of kindness to the increasingly\
  \ beleaguered Dobson.\nA pauper with a barrow was employed to trundle copies of\
  \ the pamphlet around various market squares, but he lacked the mouthy bumptiousness\
  \ required of a true salesman, and returned with the entire print-run intact. Downcast\
  \ and hopeless, the pauper trudged along the winding lane towards chez Dobson &\
  \ Chew heaving the pamphlets in a filthy frayed sack. His barrow had been stolen\
  \ by cutpurses.\nA less determined pamphleteer may have thrown in the towel at this\
  \ point, but, as has often been remarked, there was an edge of steel in Dobson.\
  \ After taking a turn around the pond, and pelting pebbles at swans, he crashed\
  \ back into the house and immediately fired off a letter to Rex Tint, the noted\
  \ mezzotintist. Ordinarily, of course, so celebrated a mezzotintist would have had\
  \ nothing to do with a pamphleteer on his uppers, but there was between the two\
  \ men a special bond. It was a bond forged in childhood, in an orchard, in the teeth\
  \ of a summer thunderstorm, a bond redolent of the hit single Two Little Boys by\
  \ the bearded Antipodean Renaissance man Rolf Harris. Neither a wooden horse nor,\
  \ later, trench warfare were involved in the Dobson-Tint Pact, but you get the general\
  \ idea.\nDobson's inspiration on this gusty Tuesday was to bind his scientific pamphlet\
  \ anew, with a really terrific Rex Tint mezzotint on the cover. Sales, he felt sure,\
  \ would go through the roof, even when handled by the pauper. Shoving the hastily-scribbled\
  \ letter into a pre-stamped jiffy bag, and enclosing as a memento of the pact a\
  \ couple of hazelnuts, Dobson roared back out and headed for the postbox at the\
  \ top of Pang Hill.\nThere is a long-running quiz show on the BBC called A Question\
  \ Of Sport. One of the regular features is a round called \u201CWhat happened next?\u201D\
  , in which the footage of some unusual sporting event is stopped just before the\
  \ crucial moment. Let us imagine that a phantom cinematographer, taking grainy black\
  \ and white film of the swans of Pang Hill Pond, turned their camera on the excited\
  \ pamphleteer, and followed him up the hill. Now, freeze the imaginary film with\
  \ Dobson just a few paces from his goal. Why did that jiffy bag never plop into\
  \ the postbox? Something happened to stop the pamphleteer in his tracks, something\
  \ that meant the letter and the hazelnuts were never sent, that Tacky To Goo was\
  \ never rebound with a terrific Rex Tint mezzotint cover, that not a single copy\
  \ of the original Gestetnered pamphlet was ever sold, and that Dobson, in despair,\
  \ never again tried to worm his way into the core of the big forbidding world o\u2019\
  \ science.\n[2007-06-09]"
