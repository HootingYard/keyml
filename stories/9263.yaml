text: "Tarleton was visited in his consulting rooms one April evening by a padding\
  \ fellow clutching a buff envelope.\nGlossary\_:\nTarleton, \u201Cthe amateur's\
  \ amateur\u201D.\nConsulting rooms, address unknown but probably in an ill-lit alleyway\
  \ off the main thoroughfare in Pointy Town.\nApril, fourth month of the year. Abolished\
  \ during the French Revolution and replaced by Germinal (to 19 April) and Flor\xE9\
  al (from 20 April). Tarleton's internal \u201Cclock\u201D was regulated accordingly,\
  \ though not for ideological reasons.\nEvening, latter part of the day, descending\
  \ into dusk and twilight and, eventually, nightfall, wherein terrors are unloosed\
  \ (see Thomas Nashe, Terrors Of The Night, 1594).\nPadding, moving like a cat.\n\
  Buff envelope, an item of stationery, not to be confused with the Buff Orpington,\
  \ a type of duck.\n\u201CWhy are you padding into my consulting rooms clutching\
  \ a duck?\u201D asked Tarleton. Then, putting on his spectacles, he added, \u201C\
  I beg your pardon, I ought to say clutching an envelope.\u201D\n\u201CWithin this\
  \ buff envelope,\u201D said the visitor, \u201CAre papers which, if revealed to\
  \ the press, could bring about the collapse of several crowned heads, and seething\
  \ unrest throughout the continent!\u201D\nGlossary:\nThen, here indicating the next\
  \ action or event in a sequence. Can also refer to the past, as in the model sentence\
  \ \u201CI was happy then, in my childhood, before the revolution, before the shambles\
  \ wrought by our new masters\u201D.\nSpectacles, eyeglasses, two monocles stuck\
  \ together with connecting wire. Often rose-tinted, though not in Tarleton's case.\n\
  Papers, top secret quasi-official documents of world-shuddering significance.\n\
  The press, generic term for newspapers, both tabloid and broadsheet, even, great\
  \ heavens to Betsy, Berliner format!, not to be confused with Papers (see above).\n\
  Collapse, can happen to puddings and souffl\xE9s if cooking times go awry.\nCrowned\
  \ heads, done away with, violently, during revolutionary upheavals.\nUnrest, second\
  \ album by Henry Cow, released in 1974. Sock on cover.\nContinent, seven known to\
  \ exist, in alphabetical order Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North\
  \ America, South America. There may be others, hidden or occult. Continental location\
  \ of Tarleton's consulting rooms not yet identified beyond every shadow of a doubt\
  \ (Alfred Hitchcock, 1943).\n\u201CGood grief!\u201D spluttered Tarleton's sidekick\
  \ Not-Tarleton, sprawled on a beanbag by the fireplace, \u201CIf what you say is\
  \ true we must act immediately to stop the collapse and unrest in their tracks!\u201D\
  \nAn enigmatic smile played over Tarleton's lips.\n\u201CMay I have the buff envelope?\u201D\
  \ he asked the visitor.\nGlossary:\nGrief, Hardship, suffering; a kind, or cause,\
  \ of hardship or suffering. Hurt, harm, mischief or injury done or caused by another;\
  \ damaged inflicted or suffered; molestation, trouble, offence. A wrong or injury\
  \ which is the subject of formal complaint or demand for redress. Gravity, grievousness\
  \ (of an offence). Feeling of offence; displeasure, anger. A bodily injury or ailment;\
  \ a morbid affection of any part of the body; a sore, wound; a blemish of the skin;\
  \ a disease, sickness. The seat of disease; the diseased part; the sore place. Physical\
  \ pain or discomfort. Mental pain, distress, or sorrow. Deep or violent sorrow,\
  \ caused by loss or trouble; a keen or bitter feeling of regret for something lost,\
  \ remorse for something done, or sorrow for mishap to oneself or others. Accidents\
  \ in steeplechasing or in the hunting-field. Also in Golf. (OED). Not-Tarleton's\
  \ usage encompasses all these meanings, and more, oh! so many more, for he is that\
  \ kind of chap, sprawled on his beanbag, spluttering.\nSidekick, a companion, colleague,\
  \ junior partner, straight man.\nNot-Tarleton, specifically in this case, Tarleton's\
  \ sidekick. More generally, can be applied to any organism, animate or inanimate,\
  \ other than Tarleton himself. Thus, everything in the universe. Space precludes\
  \ a complete list.\nBeanbag, a large sealed bag containing synthetic beans, upon\
  \ which to sprawl. Similar to the \u201CProtean armchair\u201D in The Confidence-Man\_\
  : His Masquerade by Herman Melville (1857).\nFireplace, as the name suggests, a\
  \ place of fire, of licking flames, of heat and blaze. Often located within an inglenook.\
  \ Beanbags (see above) ought only be placed near to inglenooks if they are fire-resistant,\
  \ otherwise a single spark from a hissing spitting coal upon the fire and, pfft!,\
  \ up they go in flames. For fictional treatments of the catastrophic effects of\
  \ fire upon persons, see Dickens, in particular Miss Havisham and Krook.\nTracks,\
  \ \u201CSo take a good look at my face / You'll see my smile looks out of place\
  \ / If you look closer, it's easy to trace / The tracks of my tears\u201D (The Tracks\
  \ Of My Tears, Smokey Robinson And The Miracles, 1965). In The Song Of Investment\
  \ Capital Overseas (1981), the Art Bears hint at tracks without quite mentioning\
  \ them\_: \u201CThe roads and rails run like cracks / And carry me upon their backs\u201D\
  .\nEnigmatic smile, clich\xE9 used to impart spurious depth to a fictional character.\n\
  Lips, important parts of the mouth.\nBuff envelope, remember not to confuse it with\
  \ a Buff Orpington duck.\nHesitantly, the visitor handed the buff envelope to Tarleton.\
  \ Without opening it, he in turn passed it to Not-Tarleton, still sprawled on a\
  \ beanbag by the fireplace.\n\u201CToss it on to the fire!\u201D he commanded.\n\
  Not-Tarleton did as he was bid, and within seconds the buff envelope, and its mysterious\
  \ world-shuddering contents, were consumed by the awful flames.\n\u201CI think we\
  \ can say that the world is a safer place,\u201D said Tarleton, smugly. \u201CNow,\
  \ shall we toast some crumpets?\u201D\nGlossary:\n  It would be a shame to add a\
  \ further gloss on terms at this point. We would distract from the thrilling climax\
  \ of the tale, and in any case few new words have been introduced. Hesitantly, toss,\
  \ bid, awful, toast and crumpets can be looked up in any decent dictionary, and\
  \ sometimes it is beneficial for readers to take the initiative, rather than having\
  \ everything handed to them on a plate.\nGlossary:\nPlate, or platter, an item of\
  \ crockery on which toasted crumpets are served in the consulting room of Tarleton,\
  \ the amateur's amateur, at the conclusion of the famous story Tarleton And The\
  \ Mysterious Affair Of The Buff Orpington Envelope.\n[2012-05-24]"
