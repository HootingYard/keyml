text: "Ye gods and little fishes! It seems you can't breathe a word about religion\
  \ these days without being deemed \u201Coffensive\u201D. Yesterday's piece A Weekend\
  \ With An Owl God brought to my postbag a letter from Stephen Atahualpagreen of\
  \ Aztec Voice:\nDear Mr Key\_: I am writing to protest in the strongest possible\
  \ terms about your slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith. Traducing the name of\
  \ our night owl god Chalchiuhtecolotl in such disgusting terms is not funny. It\
  \ is deeply offensive to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion, the\
  \ Aztec faith demands respect in 21st century Britain, which means, among other\
  \ things, respecting our cultural right to practice a bloody form of human sacrifice\
  \ on big stone altars. As well as feeling wounded and offended, your attack has\
  \ also made us angry, and you know what happens when the gods get angry. Please\
  \ send me your postal address and telephone number so I can publish them on our\
  \ website and provoke other Aztec believers to exact the retribution which is your\
  \ due fate.\nI did a bit of research into Mr Atahualpagreen. Apparently he sends\
  \ his children to an Aztec faith school and has successfully applied for government\
  \ funding to set up something called the Aztec Human Rights Commission.\n[2007-02-26]"
