  \ by Peter Ackroyd, notes:\nChaplin died on Christmas Day 1977. Ackroyd doesn't\
  \ mention this, but the comedian's coffin was stolen by grave robbers, who phoned\
  \ Paulette Goddard, one of his wives and the co-star of The Gold Rush, hoping they\
  \ could make a ransom demand. \u201CWe've got Chaplin,\u201D they announced. \u201C\
  So what?\u201D she said, slamming down the phone.\n[2014-04-12]"
