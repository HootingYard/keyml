text: "More shenanigans from Strange Cults And Secret Societies Of Modern London by\
  \ Elliott O'Donnell (1934):\n\u201CJust out of bravado [my friend] had slept several\
  \ nights under a tree (known to followers of the tree cult as dangerous) near certain\
  \ old cross-roads, in the South Mimms district. Now, like murder, some vices will\
  \ \u2018out\u2019; and when I saw my friend, after he had been sleeping under that\
  \ tree, I was startled at the great change in his appearance. In his face I could\
  \ detect signs of vice I had never associated with him before. He confessed his\
  \ guilt to me, and attributed it, as I have already hinted, to the cross-roads and\
  \ tree influence.\n\u201CAs he lay under the tree in question, watching its gently\
  \ swaying branches over his head, and its smooth, gleaming trunk, he felt a current\
  \ of vice emanating from it and passing into him. He felt it was trying to communicate\
  \ telepathically with him, trying to fill his mind with its own foul and beastly\
  \ ideas, and when at last he fell asleep, his dreams so strengthened his vicious\
  \ thoughts that he could never shake them off. Day and night they obsessed him,\
  \ and eventually he indulged in the vice from the urge to which there seemed to\
  \ be no escape. As a last resource, in his efforts to turn over a new leaf, he went\
  \ abroad, and I have never heard of him since.\u201D\nQuestions\_: to what foul\
  \ and beastly vice did Mr O'Donnell's friend succumb, and is the sinister tree at\
  \ South Mimms still standing? And what type of tree? A larch? A yew?\n[2010-10-07]"
