text: "\nI was so delighted by the quotation from Bernard Levin\u2014oops, I really\
  \ must remember to call him Bernard \u201CMassive, unflagging, moral, exquisitely\
  \ shaped, enormously vital, enormously funny, strong, supple, human, ripe, generous\
  \ and graceful\u201D Levin whenever I mention him\u2014that I posted it again today,\
  \ at The Dabbler.\n\nOne point that has occurred to me is the seemingly outrageous\
  \ omission from the list of \u201Cthe Jethro Tull\u201D. But I realise that, even\
  \ in 1970, the great critic intuited that the band led by the hairy monopod flautist\
  \ would never, ever, vanish down \u201Cthe memory hole of instant oblivion\u201D\
