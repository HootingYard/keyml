text: "\nEarlier this week in The Dabbler, Brit reviewed Sweeper!, a novel by the\
  \ foopballist Steve Bruce. Though I have yet to read the book itself, the review\
  \ was enough for me to recognise genius. I added a comment, saying: \u201COK, that's\
  \ it. I am destroying everything I have written to date and starting all over again\
  \ with Steve Bruce as my guide, my teacher, my inspiration.\u201D If anybody thought\
  \ I was joking, think again. In my cupboard today, you will find the first fruits\
  \ of my new approach. It's early doors, and I can't pretend to have mastered the\
  \ intricacies of the Brucesque method, but I am trying, I am trying.\nIncidentally,\
  \ astute readers will note a particularly clever metafictional sally in my piece.\
  \ Brit points to Bruce's repeated use of fundamental spelling inconsistencies in\
  \ proper names, and is dismissive of the idea that these may be due to a lack of\
  \ proofreading or copy editing. I have followed Bruce in giving my hero's name in\
  \ a number of variations, and I also refer more than once to the actor Bruce Willis.\
  \ Not only is there a pleasing Bruce / Bruce echo, but of course Willis once reputedly\
  \ wrote on an online forum the immortal words \u201Cproofreading is for pussies\u201D\
  . I leave you to untangle that one.\n[2011-12-09]"
