  \ guest forecaster is Dame Vera Lynn.\nThere'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs\
  \ of Dover tomorrow.\nNOTE\_: Hooting Yard is not responsible for any inaccuracies\
  \ in the bird forecasts provided by our guests. And quite frankly, Dame Vera has\
  \ been trotting out precisely the same forecast at regular intervals for the past\
  \ seven decades. As far as we are aware, nobody has ever thought to carry out a\
  \ statistical analysis of the accuracy, or otherwise, of her claims. Nor is her\
  \ methodology at all clear. Certainly it is grotesque to think that she makes her\
  \ pronouncements after \u201Creading\u201D the still-throbbing hot entrails of freshly-slaughtered\
  \ bluebirds, a theory propounded by some irresponsible scalliwags in the Dover-based\
  \ organisation Cliffwatch. Those people wouldn't know a haruspex if one came up\
  \ and biffed them in the chops.\nTomorrow's bird forecast will be presented by special\
  \ guest Dame Vera Lynn.\n[2013-06-04]"
