text: "I like to think that all Hooting Yard readers pay assiduous attention to the\
  \ Comments appended to postings. However, just in case some of you do not read them\
  \ avidly, I have plucked the following Comment from its proper place and am posting\
  \ it here. Why? Because it is particularly splendid, a model of what a Hooting Yard\
  \ Comment can be. This is Fitzmaurice Trenery on By Pointy Town Horse-Trough I Sat\
  \ Down And Wept:\nRhodes Gunnarsson, the noted Icelandic farrier-in-exile, favoured\
  \ the enclosing of the horse in wood on all sides with perhaps ten inches to spare\
  \ (effectively a horse-shaped box, or horse-box) which was airtight apart from a\
  \ U-shaped hole at the top, into which enough horseshoes were fed to fill the remaining\
  \ horseless cavity of the box up to about halfway.\nIt is a testament to the Icelandic\
  \ horse's unflappable character that during this whole process the box's occupant\
  \ remained quiet. Confused perhaps, but not alarmed. Even when the whole apparatus\
  \ was winched up in the air and dropped into a bronze house-sized steam-tombola\
  \ the stolid pony retained its quizzical solemnity. Not even after the tombola was\
  \ activated and the box rolled and banged and crashed around inside did the horse\
  \ cry out or make any attempt to escape the fearsome clangour.\nAnd when after one\
  \ week the tombola was finally halted, and the horse-box emerged from the chute,\
  \ and the box was dismantled, the horse stood there, serenely, with what might be\
  \ described as a horsey smirk. And the only horseshoes left were those on the feet\
  \ of the horse, and they produced a brilliant shine the like of which challenged\
  \ the moon, made night into day, and drew delighted crowds from the neighbouring\
  \ valleys.\nSadly, Gunnarsson fell foul of the ancient Icelandic law when, on returning\
  \ from a gymkhana in Norway with a clutch of trophies won by the seemingly magical\
  \ prowess his horseshoes conferred on their wearers, he was halted at customs. Being\
  \ blind and deaf since the age of five, he was oblivious of the fact that centuries-old\
  \ Icelandic legislation prevents any Icelandic horse from returning to the island\
  \ once it has been taken to another country.\nNobody knows what became of Gunnarsson\
  \ after his clash with the authorities. Some say that his method of shoeing gave\
  \ his ponies the ability to gallop over water, and that he plies the seas looking\
  \ for sailors who need ironwork replacing\u2014a bedstead perhaps, or a front gate.\
  \ And some say he floats still, on a raft made of bronze, off the coast of Iceland,\
  \ with his horses, and their trophies, and their shiny, shiny shoes.\nIncidentally,\
  \ eagle-eyed readers will have spotted that the title By Pointy Town Horse-Trough\
  \ I Sat Down And Wept is not in the same format as all the other headings in this\
  \ blog, and nor does the piece appear to belong to any of the Hooting Yard Categories\
  \ listed to your right, despite two such categories being assigned to it. The best\
  \ minds have been drafted in to resolve this dilemma, which resists all attempts\
  \ to correct it. The piece has been posted and re-posted at least a dozen times,\
  \ text coding has been stripped out, amended, and re-inserted, but all in vain.\
  \ Such incomprehensible inconsistencies give me sleepless nights. I am not joking.\n\
