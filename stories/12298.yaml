text: "\nNow here is a treat for you lot. The splendid persons at Dabbler Editions,\
  \ purveyors of e-books to the e-literate, have launched upon the world an e-anthology\
  \ of Mr Key's outpourings. By Aerostat To Hooting Yard\_: A Frank Key Reader contains\
  \ 147 stories selected by the estimable Roland Clare, who has also written a scholarly\
  \ introduction. Truly it may be said he has pored over numberless sweeping paragraphs\
  \ of majestic prose and has actually managed to work out some of the things going\
  \ on inside Mr Key's brainpans.\nAccording to the Dabbler, the anthology is \u201C\
  baffling, brilliant, brutal, and hysterically funny\u201D. It is also dirt cheap,\
  \ well within the means of even the most impecunious reader (few, if any, of whom\
  \ are as impecunious as Mr Key himself). And remember, you do not need a Kindle\
  \ to read a Kindle e-book. There are plenty of ways to read this earth-shattering\
  \ and heart-rending tome on any of the electronic contraptions you might have lying\
  \ about in your hovel. Just ask your nearest computer whizz person.\nSo the basic\
  \ idea is that you go and buy the book from amazon.co.uk or amazon.com or amazon.wherever-you-are.\
  \ You then award it five stars and post a review explaining that it is the most\
  \ noble effusion of the human spirit since [insert previous noble effusion of your\
  \ choice]. You then harry and hector everybody you know, and buttonhole strangers\
  \ in the street, also to buy the book. And on the seventh day you may put your feet\
  \ up and actually read it.\nCome on, readers. If you cannot make this the bestselling\
  \ e-book of all time, you can at least ensure that Mr Key is in with a chance of\
  \ winning the mrs joyful prize for rafia work.\nN.B. Those of you active on Facecloth\
  \ and Twitter should strain every sinew to splurge news of the book all over the\
  \ place. Remember, you will get your reward in heaven.\n[2014-01-21]"
