text: "\n\_\nIntriguingly, the serpent is belching fire not through its mouth but\
  \ from its fundament. This is more common than you might think. Often, when I roam\
  \ the lanes of my bailiwick, I come upon similar scenes of wooden tinies being menaced\
  \ by fiery serpents, and in a significant number of cases serpentine fundament-fire\
  \ is seen to occur. For the serpent, the advantage of this is that when a public-spirited\
  \ figure such as myself chances upon it and extinguishes the flames with a handy\
  \ portable fire extinguisher, it does not gag or choke on the jet of exciting fire-suppressant\
  \ foam, as invariably happens with mouth-sourced serpentine flames, but merely shrugs\
  \ it off, inasmuch as a serpent can shrug, and slithers off on its merry way down\
  \ the lane. Unfortunately, I have to say that the skittish wooden tinies whose imperilment\
  \ I so selflessly avert tend to be an ungrateful lot, and it is rare indeed that\
  \ I am even thanked, let alone given a reward. Nevertheless, I shall not stint in\
  \ my roamings, along the winding lanes of my bailiwick, armed with my fire extinguisher.\n\
  Note the disposition of the trees.\nThe picture appears in Monster Brains, to which\
  \ the reader is referred.\n[2008-03-28]"
