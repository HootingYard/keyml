text: "This year's foopball World Cup coincided with the Hooting Yard shutdown, which\
  \ means I have neglected to keep you lot apprised of the choice witterings of commentators.\
  \ Each time there is a big foopball tournament, we find ourselves wondering if one\
  \ of the TV babblers will say anything to match that classic observation from 2010\_\
  : \u201CFor a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd just plopped out\
  \ of the womb.\u201D\nMy favourite moment from this year came early in the contest.\
  \ Commenting on one of the Argentinian players, the BBC man said\_: \u201CHe's five-foot-five,\
  \ the same height as Kirsten Dunst. A dangerous little winger.\u201D\nWas he in\
  \ possession of a chart matching the heights of foopballers to Hollywood stars?\
  \ Or is a foopballer's height relative to Kirsten Dunst a standard measure? These\
  \ questions were never answered, more's the pity.\n[2018-07-13]"
