  \ literally hundreds of philanthropic and missionary organisations, some with dense\
  \ networks of local branches and committees reaching across the country. The diversity\
  \ of these causes, as well as their individual limitations, may be inferred from\
  \ this small selection of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century societies,\
  \ some of whose titles are as long as their constitutions:\nThe Ladies\u2019 Association\
  \ for the Benefit of Gentlewomen of Good Family, Reduced in Fortune Below the State\
  \ of Comfort To Which They Have Been Accustomed;\nThe Friendly Female Society, for\
  \ the Relief of Poor, Infirm, Aged Widows, and Single Women, of Good Character,\
  \ Who Have Seen Better Days;\nThe Guardian Society, for the Preservation of Public\
  \ Morals by Providing Temporary Asylums for Prostitutes;\nThe London Orphan Asylum,\
  \ for the Reception and Education of Destitute Orphans, Particularly Those Descended\
  \ from Respectable Parents;\nThe National Truss Society for the Relief of the Ruptured\
  \ Poor;\nThe Society for Returning Young Women to their Friends in the Country;\n\
  and the Royal Humane Society (to restore \u201Cpersons in a state of suspended animation\u201D\
  ).\nSeemingly, the Evangelicals had a society to cover every contingency.\nRichard\
