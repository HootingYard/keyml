  \ the Nazis in the run-up to the Second World War. It seems to me that this is now\
  \ far too familiar a charge, and that if we are going to delve into history to find\
  \ sticks with which to beat the paper, some fresh snippet is long overdue. I was\
  \ pleased, therefore, to find this anecdote about Lord Northcliffe, the founder\
  \ of the Daily Mail, in Piers Brendon's Eminent Edwardians (1979):\nThe campaigner\
  \ against the use of birds\u2019 feathers to decorate women's hats once wantonly\
  \ struck down a seagull with his stick and beat it to death on the sand.\nIncidentally,\
  \ Northcliffe seems to have had a thing about hats. In 1910, he issued a directive\
  \ to his editorial staff:\nIt is about time men had a new hat. Why not offer \xA3\
  100 for the best design for a new hat? There is at present only the silk hat, the\
  \ pot-hat or bowler (what in America is called a Derby), the straw hat, the felt\
  \ hat of various shapes (usually referred to as the Trilby\u2014I do not know why)\
  \ and the universal cap. A new-hat-for-men competition would be most amusing . .\
  \ . Let reference be made to hat monotony.\nNorthcliffe would probably have been\
  \ able to answer Peter Blegvad's questions about hats.\n[2012-08-25]"
