  \ the muck outside your hovel.\u201D\n\u201CShoveller, shoveller, please desist!\n\
  \  I love my muck, it will be much missed!\u201D\n\u201CPeasant, oh peasant, the\

  \  And your pot and your pan and your hay and your straw.\n  The princeling needs\
  \ your muck for the war.\u201D\n\u201CShoveller, shoveller, what war is that?\u201D\
  \n\u201CIt is the war of the princeling's hat.\u201D\nFragment from an old folk\
