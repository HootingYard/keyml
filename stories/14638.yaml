text: "At a loose end, I signed up for Pilbeam's Crash-Course in the Imitation of\
  \ Christ. Earlier in the day, plodding through the streets, I had been given a leaflet.\
  \ The hawker who handed it to me was a person of regrettable grubbiness, and some\
  \ of his filth inevitably besmirched the leaflet, which was smudged, with the effect\
  \ that I misread The Imitation of Christ as The Imitation of Chris.\nChris who?,\
  \ I wondered, hoping that Pilbeam was taking an overfamiliar tone with regard to\
  \ the actor Christopher Plummer. It so happened that I was wearing a Tyrolean jacket\
  \ not unlike the one sported by Plummer in his career-defining role as Captain Von\
  \ Trapp in the film version of The Sound of Music. Dressed so, I felt I would have\
  \ an excellent chance of crashing through the crash course and perhaps winning a\
  \ plaudit or two.\nAlas, a falling raindrop washed away the smudge and I realised\
  \ the course was about Christ rather than Christopher Plummer. Still, I was, as\
  \ I said, at a loose end, so I headed for the hall where the course was to be held,\
  \ and I signed up.\nThrong and hubbub packed the hall, but I found an empty seat\
  \ and sat down. Soon enough, a fellow I assumed to be Pilbeam appeared on a dais\
  \ at the front. The first thing he said was \u201CI am not Pilbeam\u201D\nHad I\
  \ been lured here under false pretences? The speaker cut a pale and widdershins\
  \ figure and was almost as grime-splattered as the hawker in the street. It may\
  \ even have been the same man, no doubt a rascal. But I had nothing better to do,\
  \ so I continued to sit and listen.\n\u201CI am sorry to say that Pilbeam is not\
  \ able to be with us today. He has been incapacitated by Mitteleuropean pig flu,\
  \ and has asked me to deputise for him. While I would never make so bold as to compare\
  \ myself to Pilbeam, please be assured that you are in good hands. I have spent\
  \ many years studying under Pilbeam, eating from the same table, having my hair\
  \ cut at the same barber's, with the same pair of scissors, and wearing the same\
  \ size shoes, like Beckett and Joyce. My name is Lars, rather than Pilbeam, but\
  \ I can say truthfully that I am the next best thing to Pilbeam when it comes to\
  \ delivering this crash course.\n\u201CSo let us turn now to the crash course itself,\
  \ the aim of which is to furnish you with the skills necessary to imitate Christ.\
  \ As it is a crash course, we will not be seeking to imitate Christ in every particular.\
  \ If we tried that\u201D\u2014he chuckled\u2014\u201Cwe would become so Christ-like\
  \ there would be a risk of blasphemy. Far better, according to Pilbeam's precepts,\
  \ to imitate Christ in a limited way, enough for us to benefit and to become holier\
  \ than we are, but not so much that we threaten the unique and ineffable goodness\
  \ of Christ Our Lord Himself.\n\u201CI trust you are all keeping up. Excellent.\
  \ In what way, then, shall we imitate Christ? You will all, I hope, be familiar\
  \ with the story of the Gadarene swine. It is to be found in all three of the Synoptic\
  \ Gospels, in Matthew 8\_: 28\u201332, in Mark 5\_: 1\u201313, and in Luke 8\_:\
  \ 26\u201333. Briefly put, a poor man possessed by demons begs Christ to release\
  \ him from his torment. Christ duly casts the demons out of the man, and into some\
  \ nearby pigs, which thereupon go rushing headlong into the sea, and drown. Certain\
  \ details differ in the three accounts, but that is the general idea.\n\u201CNow,\
  \ Pilbeam states that we can imitate Christ by driving a herd of pigs into the sea,\
  \ or indeed into any large body of water. We need not worry our little heads about\
  \ finding a man possessed by demons, and all that hullabaloo. For our purposes,\
  \ we take a crash course shortcut by imagining we have cast the demons out of the\
  \ man and into the pigs, and we simply goad the pigs into the water and make damn\
  \ sure none of them manages to make it back to shore. The important thing, in accurately\
  \ imitating Christ, is drowning the pigs. Any questions?\u201D\nI put up my hand.\n\
  \u201CIn your opening remarks,\u201D I piped up, when pointed at, \u201CYou said\
  \ that Pilbeam could not be with us because he is suffering from Mitteleuropean\
  \ pig flu. Could it be that this whole crash course is his way of exacting vicarious\
  \ revenge upon the flu-ridden pigs he blames for his condition?\u201D\nThere were\
  \ several gasps from the audience. Lars paused, menacingly, before responding.\n\
  \u201CSeldom,\u201D he roared, eventually, \u201CSeldom have I ever heard so vile\
  \ a calumny! O, vile!, vile!, the calumny you have committed upon poor saintly bed-ridden\
  \ Mitteleuropean pig flu-ridden Pilbeam, that paragon among crash course tutors\
  \ in the Imitation of Christ! How dare you, sir, how dare you?\u201D\n\u201CI'm\
  \ sorry,\u201D I said, \u201CIt was just a passing thought, that was all.\u201D\n\
  Lars seemed mollified, if only slightly.\n\u201CThere is a fourth, apocryphal version\
  \ of the story of the Gadarene swine,\u201D he said, \u201CIn Pilbeam 6\_: 42\u2013\
  51. Here, after driving the pigs into the sea, Christ has his henchmen\u2014sorry,\
  \ Apostles\u2014attack the man from whom demons have been cast out, beating him\
  \ insensible with spades and shovels before injecting his bruised and battered body\
  \ with a virulent strain of Mitteleuropean pig flu and then abandoning him on a\
  \ remote atoll far, far out at sea. Usually we do not attempt to enact the Pilbeam\
  \ version on this crash course, for want of a volunteer, but on this occasion we\
  \ shall take great pleasure in doing so.\u201D\nAnd Lars clapped his hands and summoned\
  \ his Apostles\u2014sorry, henchmen\u2014and they dragged me out of the hall and\
  \ off towards a coastal pig farm, and the vast, wet, unforgiving sea.\n[2016-03-07]"
