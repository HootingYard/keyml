text: "I have never given serious thought to the idea of reincarnation, and it is\
  \ about time I did so. After all, we are serious people, are we not?, and we should\
  \ think seriously about everything, absolutely everything, as it falls within our\
  \ purview. There will be many subjects deserving of only our fleeting attention,\
  \ but even those we should consider with all due seriousness. In that spirit, and\
  \ in the full knowledge that the concept of reincarnation, or the transmigration\
  \ of souls, is almost certainly arrant poppycock, let us see if we can winkle from\
  \ it anything of significance.\nIn some versions of the theory, the transmigrating\
  \ soul flits from species to species. This would suggest that, immediately before\
  \ the glorious event that was the arrival upon earth of Mr Key, I might have been,\
  \ say, a bat or a prawn or a tulip. This is a perfect example of something so foolish\
  \ that our fleeting attention can fly away from it tout suite, with nary a backward\
  \ glance. Like the collected written outpourings of Will Self, it can be safely\
  \ tucked away and forgotten about. We gave it our serious attention, for a moment\
  \ or two, and then moved on, sensibly, as sensible and serious persons do.\nOf more\
  \ interest is the idea that, as the spark of life is extinguished in one human corporeal\
  \ being, at the very moment when life passes it makes a leap into a brand new host.\
  \ Though as preposterous as the idea that I was once a tulip, this at least has\
  \ a certain tidiness about it. If, for a while, we entertain the possibility of\
  \ it being true, the urgent question then thumps inside our heads\u2014who were\
  \ you, Mr Key, before you were Mr Key?\nI am minded to date the dawn of my existence\
  \ not to the date of birth, but to the moment of conception in my mother's womb.\
  \ Unless one's father is a precise and punctilious Walter Shandy figure, that moment\
  \ is well nigh impossible to pinpoint, so the best we can do is to use informed\
  \ guesswork. Counting backwards from the date of my (premature) birth, it is likely\
  \ that I was conceived in the dying days of May in the Year of Our Lord MCMLVIII,\
  \ or, as modern barbarians would prefer, 1958. So who shuffled off this mortal coil\
  \ around that time, apart from several bats or prawns or tulips?\nThree candidates\
  \ present themselves\u2014the Romanian aviator Constantin Cantacuzino, the Spanish\
  \ writer Juan Ram\xF3n Jim\xE9nez, and\u2014skipping forward slightly to the beginning\
  \ of June\u2014the American oceanographer Townsend Cromwell. The next stage of my\
  \ serious research will be to immerse myself in the lives of this trio, finding\
  \ out all I can, perhaps entering a fugue state. Without leaping ahead of myself,\
  \ I have to say that my favourite of the three, at this stage, is the Spaniard,\
  \ not so much on account of his Nobel Prize for Literature (1956), but because,\
  \ judging by this photograph, his wife is wearing exactly the sort of hat I can\
  \ imagine Pansy Cradledew sporting atop her lovely head.\nI will keep you informed\
  \ of my findings.\n\n[2015-06-15]"
