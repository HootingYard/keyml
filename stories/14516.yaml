text: "I was commissioned to write a fat book entitled Meetings With Remarkable Buntings.\
  \ Biro poised, I was about to set to work when it occurred to me that I did not\
  \ know whether I was meant to be writing about birds or those decorative strings\
  \ of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions such as gala days. I rang the\
  \ publishers to find out.\nThe person I spoke to sounded about twelve years old\
  \ and was brimming with confidence, in spite of being clueless. As soon as I uttered\
  \ the word \u201Cbird\u201D she started to babble excitedly about something called\
  \ Twitter. I slammed the phone down. I was able to do this because I was using a\
  \ proper telephone, one with a receiver resting on a cradle. With these new-fangled\
  \ mobile horrors, one cannot slam them down in a satisfying spat of ill temper without\
  \ risking breakage.\nI decided my best bet was to write about both types of bunting\
  \ and, with the twittery inanities of the publisher sloshing in my ears, took up\
  \ my biro to write about the bird. But then I paused. The title of the book spoke\
  \ of Meetings With buntings. I would have to go and find a bunting and commune with\
  \ it. Now, my ornithological ignorance is staggering, and frankly I wouldn't know\
  \ a bunting from a nuthatch or a pipit or a starling or a wagtail. So I rang the\
  \ Emergency Bird Information Hotline.\nThe person who answered the phone sounded\
  \ about twelve years old and was brimming with avian confidence. I told her I wanted\
  \ to know all there was to know about buntings.\n\u201CDo you mean the bird or the\
  \ decorative strings of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions such as\
  \ gala days?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CWell, you're the Emergency Bird Information\
  \ Hotline,\u201D I said, \u201CSo I mean the bird, obviously.\u201D\n\u201CIt might\
  \ seem obvious to you,\u201D she said, \u201CBut you would be surprised how many\
  \ enquiries we receive about the decorative strings of triangular flags. We are\
  \ a very festive organisation, forever holding fetes and galas, and so we have bunting\
  \ hanging permanently outside our headquarters. I think that is why people call\
  \ us when they want to know about non-bird bunting as well as bunting the bird.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWell I want to know about the bird,\u201D I said, but she was prattling\
  \ on regardless.\n\u201CActually we are having a little garden party this afternoon\
  \ in celebration of the common chaffinch. Would you like to come? You'll be able\
  \ to see our display of bunting\u2014the decorative strings of triangular flags,\
  \ that is, rather than the birds. But there will be a couple of stuffed chaffinches\
  \ for you to look at if you want to know more about them.\u201D\n\u201CI want to\
  \ know about the bunting, not the chaffinch!\u201D I shouted, and slammed down the\
  \ phone, again.\nIn my rather satisfying spat of ill temper, I went for a walk by\
  \ the pond and chucked pebbles at swans. Then it occurred to me that I ought to\
  \ attend the garden party so I could commune with the non-bird bunting. Then at\
  \ least I would have something to write about. I pranced home and rang the Emergency\
  \ Bird Information Hotline again. A robotic voice informed me that the line had\
  \ been disconnected. I repaired to my escritoire and picked up my biro.\nOver the\
  \ course of my life I have met many remarkable buntings, I wrote, lying shamelessly,\
  \ but who would know?, None more so, perhaps, than Bunting, the Swedish halfbreed\
  \ skimmel horse which became a film star. Bunting played Pippi Longstocking's horse\
  \ Lilla Gubben in a series of films directed by Olle Hellbom.\nOf course I had never\
  \ actually met Bunting, and my knowledge of horses is as patchy as my knowledge\
  \ of birds, but I felt I was getting to grips with my material. Birds and those\
  \ decorative strings of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions such as\
  \ gala days and Emergency Bird Information Hotline garden parties in celebration\
  \ of the common chaffinch could take a back seat for the time being. By the time\
  \ I'd finished with Bunting the film star horse, we would be firm friends and boon\
  \ companions, at least within my head.\nI made a mental note to ring the publisher\
  \ and suggest we amend the title of my book to Meetings With Remarkable Buntings\
  \ Inside My Head. Then I carried on writing, daddy-o, like a man possessed of unfathomable\
  \ horse-based inventive genius.\n[2016-01-28]"
