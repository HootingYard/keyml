text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, Please look very carefully at the attached photograph.
  I have been staring at it constantly for about five hours, and I have convinced
  myself that the person we see here depicted is the out of print pamphleteer Dobson.
  You may wish to assert that a) the image is not a photograph and b) Dobson would
  never have allowed himself to be caught on camera while so preposterously engarbed.
  You are of course fully entitled to express such objections, but bear in mind that
  I am a man of mighty optical acuity and I know what I am talking about. Call me
  a deluded idiot if you must. I am now going to go on an Easter picnic event. Yours
  sincerely, Tim.
