text: "I don't drive, and am almost wholly ignorant about cars. Certainly, other than\
  \ a couple of iconic designs such as the VW Beetle and the Mini, I cannot tell one\
  \ make of car from another. Thus it was, and remains, inexplicable to me how my\
  \ eldest son, when tiny, eagerly announced the name of every car he saw. He was\
  \ two or three years old at the time, not yet able to read, but when we went for\
  \ a walk, he would point at each parked car we saw along a street, piping up its\
  \ name. Other than his mispronunciation of \u201CFord Sierra\u201D as \u201CFonsierra\u201D\
  , he was unerringly correct. Eventually, he stopped doing this, and moved on to\
  \ other childish things, straightforward and unremarkable. One's own child is never\
  \ unremarkable, of course, but I mean to say that the talents he developed and displayed\
  \ were not what Charles Fort would have described as \u201Cwild talents\u201D, such\
  \ as that somehow eerie, pre-literate knowledge of cars. Where did it come from?\n\
  I had more or less forgotten about this as the years passed, until this morning,\
  \ when I read:\nwe moved back to Paris, and there I have, on my father's authority,\
  \ a story about people standing him drinks at the caf\xE9 while I entertained the\
  \ clientele by identifying the marque of each car as it passed on the boulevard:\
  \ \u201CRenault! Peugeot! Citr\xF6en! Simca!\u201D I haven't evinced any savant\
  \ talents since, but apparently at two I had this precocious knack\u2014of cars\
  \ only, French cars in particular.\nThat is Peter Blegvad, reminiscing in The Bleaching\
  \ Stream (Journal of the London Institute of \u2018Pataphysics, Number 3, Absolu\
  \ 139). It is precisely the same case as my son\u2014the infant savant, privy to\
  \ a body of knowledge without apparent provenance, displayed for a brief period\
  \ when very young. Is this more common than I thought?\n[2011-09-10]"
