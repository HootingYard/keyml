text: "Far away in the Antipodes, Glyn Webster has been pondering the terrible choice\
  \ the lieutenant-colonel had to make between the muffins, on one side of his breakfast\
  \ table, and the loaded pistols on the other. The result of Mr Webster's exercising\
  \ of his cranial integuments is this splendid heraldic device:\n\nI pointed out\
  \ to Mr Webster that the muffins shown were unlikely to be the type of muffins which\
  \ caused the lieutenant-colonel his dyspeptic atrocities. When you print out the\
  \ device\u2014and note I say \u201Cwhen\u201D, not \u201Cif\u201D\u2014you may use\
  \ Tippex\u2122 and a pencil to adjust the muffins to your preferred muffin-type\
  \ should you so desire. But remember the religious ruling which states \u201Cuncertainty\
  \ of muffin-type is no great sin\u201D.\nIncidentally, Mr Webster has been reading\
  \ Zoonomia by Erasmus Darwin, and has found \u201Cmany alarming stories about pistols\u201D\
  , but not the one involving the lieutenant-colonel and his muffins. Was De Quincey\
  \ making it up?\n[2009-03-08]"
