text: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that, in this country at least, the\
  \ cultural tastes of top sportspersons are irredeemably bland and lowbrow. Our native\
  \ footballers, for example, when asked to name their favourite books, will invariably\
  \ mention Harry Potter or Andy McNab, if, that is, they have ever read any books\
  \ at all. (This is not the case with foreign footballers, particularly the French,\
  \ who are intellectual titans by comparison.) Similarly, the default music choice\
  \ for sporting champs seems to be smooth jazz, or jazz funk, or, in the world o\u2019\
  \ rock, U2, Coldplay, and Phil Collins.\nThe great exception to this has always\
  \ been snookerist Steve Davis. The carefully-crafted public image of a man who,\
  \ away from a snooker table, is a boring mediocrity disguises the truth that Mr\
  \ Davis is a fanatical and knowledgeable enthusiast of prog and related musics.\
  \ Indeed, I seem to recall that some years ago he used his wealth to persuade Teutonic\
  \ nutcases Magma to reform for a series of concerts, and has expressed a desire\
  \ to do the same with Henry Cow, so far in vain.\n\nSo I am extremely grateful to\
  \ reader Alasdair Dickson for drawing my attention to PhoenixFM, Brentwood and Billericay's\
  \ community radio station, where Mr Davis has a regular show called The Interesting\
  \ Alternative. Look at those playlists! As Mr Dickson says, there is a fair amount\
  \ of witless prog noodling, but also early Soft Machine, the 5UU's, Camberwell Now,\
  \ Univers Zero, and many other Recommended or Recommendedish records.\nI know that\
  \ Hooting Yard readers never listen to any other radio station than ResonanceFM,\
  \ but until the powers-that-be at Borough High Street snap up Steve Davis, you will\
  \ all be forgiven for tuning in online to PhoenixFM for his show, wherever you are\
  \ in the world.\n[2010-02-17]"
