text: "Aladdin is possibly the best-known of the Tales Of The One Hundred And One\
  \ Nights, fodder for panto and Disney and even for film-makers in the Soviet Union.\
  \ I have never read the story myself, in any version, and I doubt that I ever will,\
  \ now that I have chanced upon Thomas De Quincey's judgment of it.\nIn Infant Literature,\
  \ he wrote: \u201Cin Aladdin, after the possession of the lamp has been once secured\
  \ by a pure accident, the story ceases to move. All the rest is a mere record of\
  \ upholstery; how this saloon was finished today, and that window on the next day,\
  \ with no fresh incident whatever\u201D.\nThat said, it's an interesting narrative\
  \ technique, if one has a particular readership, such as upholsterers, in mind.\
  \ But I don't.\n[2009-04-15]"
