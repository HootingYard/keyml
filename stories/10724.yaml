text: "I strode out shortly after daybreak to check my traps. I had set them up, two\
  \ of them, on the edge of the woods, and as I approached in the milky morning light\
  \ I was pleased to see that in each I had ensnared a monster of duplicity.\nThe\
  \ duplicity of the first monster consisted of its having two heads, where you would\
  \ expect to find only the one. Almost all beings with heads have just a single head,\
  \ perched on a single neck. This trapped monster did indeed have a single neck,\
  \ but at a certain point it bifurcated in order to support a pair of heads. Adding\
  \ to the monster's monstrosity was the remarkable, even nauseating, disparity in\
  \ the heads. The one on the left was a smooth and baldy head, almost egg-like. When\
  \ I was close enough to study its features I saw that it had a pair of tiny piggy\
  \ eyes and a minuscule snub of a nose and thin pinched lips. I saw no sign of ears.\
  \ But the other head! It was misshapen and hairy and disgusting, with several eyes\
  \ and noses and more than one mouth and numerous ears, and it emitted a godawful\
  \ grunting noise that sent shivers down its own spine, or rather, the spine it shared\
  \ with its other head. I watched those shivers snaking up and down the protruding\
  \ spine with cold, emotionless fascination. I knew I was going to kill the monster,\
  \ sooner or later.\nBut first I turned my attention to my second trap, and the second\
  \ monster. Its duplicity was not a simple matter of having two heads, for it had\
  \ just one, and that not a particularly monstrous head. If anything, it was a rather\
  \ handsome head, a head one might easily imagine topping the beautiful body of a\
  \ young Apollo. Quite what kind of body the monster had was, however, a matter of\
  \ conjecture. Evidently when my trap snapped shut it did so precisely upon the monster's\
  \ neck, detaching the head from the body. Judging by the pawprints in the mud, the\
  \ headless body had then fled, leaving the head lolling helpless, the severed neck\
  \ caught in the fangs of the trap. Its duplicity, then, was that head and body could\
  \ continue to exist, even to thrive, separately. I pondered whether to follow the\
  \ pawprints, but saw that they terminated nearby, where the body of the monster\
  \ had plunged into the marsh, the better to make its escape.\nI popped the handsome\
  \ head into my pippy bag and slung it over my shoulder. Then I bashed the heads\
  \ of the other monster with my spade, rendering it unconscious. I freed it from\
  \ the trap and tied it up with butchers\u2019 string and shoved it on to my cart.\
  \ Before leaving the edge of the woods, I reset both traps. Other monsters roamed\
  \ these parts, and though I could trap only two at a time, I would never stint in\
  \ my efforts.\n[2012-12-29]"
