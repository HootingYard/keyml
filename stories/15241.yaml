text: "From his banishment in a pompous land, Mike Jennings writes to suggest that\
  \ I exhume the piece Dim Tyrant, posted here in 2010. \u201CThe dim tyrant, Crepuscus\
  \ VIII, would seem very relevant all of a sudden,\u201D says Mr Jennings, \u201C\
  Given his, quote, fateful combination of childish whimsy and an inability to string\
  \ together a coherent sentence, unquote.\u201D What POTUS could he possibly be thinking\
  \ of? Anyway, here is the piece, which does seem, at least in its earlier passages,\
  \ spookily prophetic.\nAssessing the career of the tyrant king Crepuscus VIII, it\
  \ is hard to avoid the conclusion that he was excessively dull-witted and dim. There\
  \ is a plethora of anecdotage, from courtiers and palace leeches, revealing that\
  \ the king was rarely able to answer simple questions such as \u201CWhat part of\
  \ the body sits atop the neck?\u201D, \u201CHow many angels can dance upon the head\
  \ of a pin?\u201D or \u201CWho won the 1953 FA Cup Final?\u201D\nAnd yet this atrociously\
  \ stupid man ruled over a mighty kingdom for many years, his hands steady at the\
  \ helm though his mind was doolally. So, dim as he was, he has much to teach us\
  \ about the craft of kingship, and indeed of tyranny, if we consider tyranny a craft.\
  \ For let there be no doubt that his reign was tyrannical.\n\u201CIn the case of\
  \ Crepuscus VIII,\u201D wrote the historian Sagely, sagely, \u201Cwe find a fateful\
  \ combination of childish whimsy and an inability to string together a coherent\
  \ sentence. Thus it was that his henchpersons invariably misunderstood his ukases,\
  \ but hurried to fulfil them come what may.\u201D Sagely gives as an example the\
  \ occasion when the tyrant king's whim was to burn down every barn in the land.\
  \ But so muddled and mangled was the manner in which he gave the command that his\
  \ Royal Barn Burner mistakenly put a pot-belled pig in charge of the palace treasury\
  \ instead. As might have been expected, the pig spent every last golden coin on\
  \ swill, and not a barn was burned to the ground. Fortunately, Crepuscus VIII was\
  \ so dim that he did not realise what had happened, nor why, and he retired to his\
  \ boudoir to gaze at the ceiling, thinking it was the vault of heaven.\nOne could\
  \ multiply such flimflam until the cows come home, and indeed there are many amusing\u2014\
  and sometimes alarming\u2014books which cobble together hundreds of instances of\
  \ Crepuscus VIII's imbecility. I want to take a slightly different tack, however.\
  \ The thing that has always fascinated me about the tyrant king is not his breathtaking\
  \ dimness but his dinner jackets.\nDinner was of supreme importance at the court\
  \ of Crepuscus VIII. Whatever else was going on, at four o\u2019 clock sharp every\
  \ day, the king would sweep into his banqueting hall and sit down at his banqueting\
  \ table, at which would be gathered all sorts of banqueting companions. In spite\
  \ of his dimness, the king liked to be entertained during dinner by philosophers,\
  \ scientists, novelists, artists, actors, clowns, jugglers, pamphleteers, scruffily-bearded\
  \ film directors, engineers, podcast maestros, deep sea divers, chefs, snipers,\
  \ ornithologists, sundry persons with metal plates in their skulls, magicians, mountaineers,\
  \ ex-Beatles, priests, anthropologists, cartographers, architects, mesmerists, and,\
  \ if he was available, Rolf Harris. It is doubtful if any of the high-flown table\
  \ talk penetrated the king's dull-witted brain, but he sat there, a fork in each\
  \ hand (he never used a knife), beaming, and resplendent in his dinner jacket of\
  \ the day.\nThere were seven of these jackets, one for each day of the week, and\
  \ the king cut quite a dash in all of them. Monday's was made of crimplene and cardboard,\
  \ with golden stars and ribbons and a coathanger embedded in it. Tuesday's was of\
  \ plain burlap sacking, adorned with coal dust and grease. Wednesday's was a gorgeous\
  \ embroidered flapping wonder. Thursday's was satin, boxy and black. Friday's was\
  \ knit from strands of a rare and stinking wool, shorn from rabid sheep, tie-dyed\
  \ like some hippy shawl, surrounded by an aura invisible. Saturday's was of classic\
  \ cut but frayed at the cuffs, with dangling bells. Sunday's was somehow a blur,\
  \ as if the king was vibrating, or on another plane just beyond human apprehension.\
  \ Whatever day of the week it was, whichever dinner jacket he was wearing, the tyrant\
  \ king ate sparingly, birdseed and millet mostly, accompanied by sips of lukewarm\
  \ water from the palace spigot.\nToday the dinner jackets can be found hanging in\
  \ display cases in a jolly little museum hidden away in one of the less salubrious\
  \ faubourgs of Pointy Town. I exhort you to pay a visit, nay, repeated visits. Study\
  \ the jackets, now caked with dust, hear the echoes of all that banqueting table\
  \ babbling, take away with you a souvenir packet of Tyrant King's Birdseed\xAE,\
  \ relive the days when Crepuscus VIII reigned over us, dim and tyrannical and cutting\
  \ quite a dash.\nThe part of the body atop the king's neck, by the way, was his\
  \ head.\n[2017-02-12]"
