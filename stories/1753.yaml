text: "Mr Key is pleased to announce that readers, obsessives, and persons of a bonkers\
  \ disposition can now follow Hooting Yard on Witter. As you may already know, Witter\
  \ is an exciting new social networking service, designed for people with pea-sized\
  \ brains who want to shrink them further, even unto the point of invisibility. The\
  \ idea is that, every fifty years, \u201Cwitterers\u201D write an account of their\
  \ doings, in beautiful if somewhat clogged handwriting, on sheets of vellum, and\
  \ roll the sheets up, and seal them with wax, and carry them around the countryside,\
  \ stopping every now and then to accost a wayfarer or a peasant, whom they shove\
  \ into a ditch, and to whom they then read the \u201Cwitter\u201D, aloud, and at\
  \ length. I think you will all agree that this is a splendid new way to get the\
  \ Hooting Yard message\x9D across to folk far and wide.\nWitter should not be confused\
  \ with a similar service, recently popularised by, among others, the Most Intelligent\
  \ Life-Form Ever To Walk The Earth, otherwise known as Stephen Fry, who cleverly\
  \ uses it to demonstrate his command of childish scatological exclamations, to the\
  \ delight of a thankful nation.\n\u201CAll man's miseries derive from not being\
  \ able to sit quietly in a room alone.\u201D\u2014Pascal\n[2009-02-10]"
