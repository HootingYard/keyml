text: "Reading a couple of blog postages today led me to cast my mind back to the\
  \ heyday of nisbet spotting in the early nineteen-seventies. In The Dabbler, ZMKC\
  \ fondly recalls an absurd and pointless exchange of correspondence with a schoolfriend,\
  \ while BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet apologises (unnecessarily) that she is \u201C\
  thinking aloud about nothing in particular\u201D.\nAbsurdity, pointlessness and\
  \ \u201Cnothing in particular\u201D as one's subject matter all dovetail neatly\
  \ into the theory and practice of nisbet spotting. I earlier gave some account of\
  \ this exciting activity here. To recap, aged around ten or eleven, I created a\
  \ newspaper or magazine which purported to be the Official Journal of the Nisbet\
  \ Spotting Society. Written by hand, illustrated with drawings and collages, the\
  \ pages carefully stapled together\u2014though not with fairy staples\u2014the contents\
  \ of the Journal chronicled the failure of the Society's members ever to spot a\
  \ nisbet. Indeed, I made it a conscious point never to explain what a nisbet was.\
  \ I suppose it was my version of the Snark or the Boojum, though I don't think I\
  \ had read Carroll's \u201CAgony In Eight Fits\u201D at the time.\nDid the nisbet\
  \ even exist, or were those seeking to spot one on a futile quest? We shall never\
  \ know, for before I faced up to deciding one way or another, I abandoned the Journal\
  \ after five or six issues and discovered other enthusiasms. I continued to write,\
  \ though I don't remember what. Then soon enough I entered the dread world of teendom,\
  \ and became very serious and earnest, as teenpersons will do, and my writing suffered\
  \ accordingly. I had an important message for the world, if only it would listen.\
  \ It did not.\nIt took about ten years for me to regain my mojo, and to realise\
  \ that the absurdity and pointlessness and \u201Cnothing\u201D of nisbet spotting\
  \ showed the way forward. To a large extent, everything I have written over the\
  \ past quarter of a century, since the first Malice Aforethought Press booklet in\
  \ 1986, has been a sort of hommage to those hapless enthusiasts of the Nisbet Spotting\
  \ Society.\n[2011-09-14]"
