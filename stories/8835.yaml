text: "Victorian ladies who, one gets the impression, spent most of their lives in\
  \ what is now known as \u2018socialising\u2019, rarely set foot in the kitchen except\
  \ to have words with Cook, but were frequently found in hysterics, or high strikes\
  \ as the condition was vulgarly known. When visitors came to call, a young woman\
  \ had to know when to stay in the room or when to make herself scarce and while\
  \ the writers on etiquette tried to be reassuring\u2014\u2018A young girl with all\
  \ the freshness of youth and the sweet dignity of woman-hood has a sure passport\
  \ into society which assures her a warmth of welcome\u2019 (the proviso, as long\
  \ as her papa has pots of money, was considered at once too obvious and too coarse\
  \ to be stated)\u2014it is no surprise that so many of them were reduced to lying\
  \ on the floor drumming their heels and screaming. Hysteria, which was, according\
  \ to The Dictionary Of Daily Wants, \u2018more common in females than men\u2019\
  , was characterised by \u2018low spirits, a feeling of depression and anxiety, sudden\
  \ involuntary grief and tears, palpitation, sickness, a sense of suffocation and\
  \ the apparent presence of a ball in the throat; theses symptoms are or are not\
  \ attended with sobs and sudden fits of laughter, convulsive twitches and contractions\
  \ of the hands and arms, finally terminating, after more or less muscular contractions,\
  \ in insensibility and coma\u2019. If the patient was young and robust, she was\
  \ bled, but in general it was thought sufficient to throw cold water on her.\nfrom\
