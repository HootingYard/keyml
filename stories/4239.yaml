text: "The bells of hell do not ring, says Theophrastus Dogend, they clank and clunk,\
  \ eternally, awfully, deafeningly. This is because they are battered and broken,\
  \ with great cracks and fissures. He adds that they are covered in mould, of stinking\
  \ greeny-grey.\nThere are no bells in hell, we are told by Pilupus Taxifor. He says\
  \ the clanks and clunks are the din of infernal machinery, engines of havoc, designed\
  \ to torment the damned. If there be stinking mould upon the machines he does not\
  \ say.\nWhile Optrex Gibbus maintains there are precisely ten thousand bells in\
  \ hell, each of them numbered, each in its own belfry, and they are rung by sinners,\
  \ in expiation, the bell-pulls in the form of vipers, which bite the sinners\u2019\
  \ hands and wrists each time they peal their designated bell.\nDobson's pamphlet\
  \ Hell, Its Bells (out of print) is an attempt to untangle the contradictions in\
  \ these authorities, each of which, he contends, has at least a grain of truth.\
  \ Are there bells in hell, he asks, or are there not? If there are, do they ring\
  \ or do they clank? And clunk? Are there ten thousand bells, or fewer, or more,\
  \ even an infinity of bells, just as there is an infinity of pits and dungeons and\
  \ oubliettes in which the damned languish forever?\nThe pamphleteer's research for\
  \ this paper, which he read aloud at a meeting of the Sawdust Bridge Platform Debating\
  \ Initiative on the tenth of April 1954, led him up some pretty horrible pathways,\
  \ pathways more abhorrent even than the one that runs parallel to the disgusting\
  \ canal wherein the vomit of generations has collected. Why it is that drunks and\
  \ those with stomach disorders have habitually seen fit to throw up their guts in\
  \ a canal basin at the end of a long and twisting lane far from any clinics and\
  \ hostelries is a mystery Dobson never investigated, so far as we know. But he was\
  \ spellbound by the bells of hell, upon which, he believed, so much, so very very\
  \ much, hinged. It is a pity he never got round to writing the follow-up pamphlet,\
  \ Hell, Its Bells, And All That Hinges Upon Them, With Lots Of Details, a work which\
  \ exists only in the form of illegible scribblings in a notebook half of which is\
  \ burned and the remaining half smeared with a stinking greeny-grey goo, which might\
  \ be mould scraped from the bells of hell, but might on the other hand just be the\
  \ sort of goo that Dobson managed to attract to himself, in his wanderings, God\
  \ knows how.\n[2010-04-10]"
