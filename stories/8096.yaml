text: "\nSkippy The Bush Kangaroo might so easily have been called Googie. The eponymous\
  \ marsupial heroine of the Australian television series, which ran from 1966 to\
  \ 1968 and is still shown regularly on Iranian state television, was the brainchild\
  \ of John McCallum (1918\u20132010), the husband of the late lamented Googie Withers\
  \ (1917\u20132011). I am not for a moment suggesting that McCallum compared his\
  \ wife to a kangaroo, but surely, when he was casting around in his mind for a name\
  \ for his bouncy outback heroine, and he was thinking of something ending in an\
  \ \u201C-ee\u201D sound, he must have considered Googie. I don't know this for sure,\
  \ but it seems at least plausible, doesn't it?\nIt may be that, at breakfast one\
  \ morning, the successful theatre and film actor and television producer, who served\
  \ in the Australian Imperial Force in New Guinea during World War Two, looked over\
  \ at his wife and said something along the lines of \u201CYou know, darling, this\
  \ intelligent kangaroo that will be the heroine of my television series for children,\
  \ how about calling her Googie?\u201D\nGoogie, whose birth name was Georgette, may\
  \ have been amused, and chuckled, or alternately irritated, and chucked the peel\
  \ of her grapefruit across the breakfast table at her husband. We do not know, and\
  \ alas they are both now cold in their graves, so we cannot ask them. But a scene\
  \ like this may well have been played out in the breakfast room of their beautifully-appointed\
  \ Sydney home one morning in the nineteen-sixties. I am assuming it was beautifully-appointed.\
  \ I would like to think it was.\nIf Googie had been amused, and chuckled, it might\
  \ be that, later, she had second thoughts, and told her husband not to go ahead\
  \ with \u201CGoogie The Bush Kangaroo\u201D but to choose a different name. If,\
  \ on the other hand, she had been irritated and chucked the peel of her grapefruit\
  \ at him, he would probably have said something like, \u201CI was only kidding,\
  \ darling!\u201D, and reassured her with a uxorious kiss. Depending on the size\
  \ of the Withers-McCallum breakfast table, he may have been able to accomplish this\
  \ by raising himself slightly from his chair and leaning forwards. It is more likely,\
  \ I think, for a successful couple living in a beautifully-appointed home, that\
  \ their breakfast table would have been a tad too large for such a manoeuvre, and\
  \ John McCallum would have had to stand up and walk a few paces towards where Googie\
  \ Withers sat. But this is mere conjecture.\nAs is, I have to say, the possibility\
  \ that Skippy, the bush kangaroo at the centre of this domestic maelstrom, had already\
  \ been named Skippy by her keepers at the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park where\
  \ the series was mostly filmed, if that was indeed where she lived when not working.\
  \ Having cast the kangaroo, a wild female Eastern Grey, for whatever qualities she\
  \ had that made her suitable, McCallum, or more likely a member of the production\
  \ team delegated to the task, will have asked the keepers the name of the marsupial.\
  \ \u201CSkippy,\u201D they would have said (not, of course, \u201CGoogie\u201D).\
  \ Thus the series title may have been a fait accompli. I am sure there is documentation\
  \ in the archives of the Australian Nine Network television channel, or indeed among\
  \ the paperwork of the Withers-McCallum estate, which could shed some light on this.\
  \ \u201CSkippy\u201D does seem to be a fortuitously telegenic name for a marsupial\
  \ heroine, and it is equally likely that the kangaroo was specially renamed for\
  \ the series. Hence the possibility of that breakfast table conversation.\nOn a\
  \ personal note, I should add that, though I have no memory of ever watching an\
  \ episode of Skippy The Bush Kangaroo, I am certain that I must have done so, at\
  \ least once or twice, when it was shown on British television, long long ago. The\
  \ same goes for Flipper, about a dolphin, and Daktari, which I recall featured a\
  \ lion, or lions. Clearly there was a sixties fad for children's television shows\
  \ about wild animals, of both land and sea. One wonders if anybody\u2014John McCallum?\
  \ Googie Withers?\u2014ever had the idea of bringing Skippy and Flipper and the\
  \ Daktari lion together, in a special show, a triumvirate of beasts setting the\
  \ world to rights, like a trio of superheroes.\n[2012-01-12]"
