text: "Approaching his seventieth birthday, Robert Wyatt has reportedly decided to\
  \ \u201Cstop making music\u201D. The writer Richard Williams rang him up to confirm\
  \ if this was true. Wyatt responded with an anecdote\nabout the novelist Jean Rhys,\
  \ who, after a long period of inactivity, responded to her publisher's gentle suggestion\
  \ that she might like to write another book by asking him if he'd enjoyed her last\
  \ one. \u201CYes, of course,\u201D he answered. \u201CWell, read it again,\u201D\
  \ Rhys said.\nIndeed. I will be taking up the invitation (the command?) to listen\
  \ again to Wyatt's extensive back catalogue. He was one of my earliest musical uberenthusiasms,\
  \ from the day in the very early 1970s when my older brother came home clutching\
  \ a double-album reissue of Soft Machine Volumes One and Two. (Side one of the latter\
  \ remains one of my putative Desert Island Discs.)\nJust as the career of the out\
  \ of print pamphleteer Dobson is intertwined with his inamorata and Muse, Marigold\
  \ Chew, so we must never overlook the contribution of Alfreda Benge to Wyatt's work.\
  \ I was once asked to name my favourite painting. It wasn't an Old Master or modernist\
  \ masterpiece from one of the great galleries. It was\u2014still is\u2014Benge's\
  \ cover for Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard (1975). (Click for huge version.)\n\n\
