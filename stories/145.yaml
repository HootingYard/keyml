text: "A topic of consuming interest to a number of people is the manner in which\
  \ Detective Captain Cargpan cut his crime-fighting chops. So impassioned are some\
  \ that there is a weekly magazine to cater to their needs, entitled O Cargpan! That\
  \ Thou Were With Us Still! in which beetle-browed fans with nothing better to do\
  \ publish lengthy and frankly tedious disquisitions upon the earlier cases of the\
  \ renowned copper. A short extract will suffice to give you some idea of the content:\n\
  Later that summer, Cargpan was assigned to the team which had been trying, fruitlessly,\
  \ to solve the mysterious case of the pod persons from Porlock. Acting on a tip\
  \ off from Krumbein, the ambitious young detective took fruit with him to his first\
  \ briefing. His plums were bruised, but he calculated, correctly, that the investigation\
  \ would no longer be fruitless. His colleagues on the case were Kandinsky, Ferrero-Roch\xE9\
  , Pabulum, Squit, Cranedneck, Solomon Gilliblat, Hinges, Darjeeling, Mens Sana,\
  \ Pillipap, Coobin, Hoobin, Therapanticack and Choobin, Wesk, Flopper, Ruskin, Whistler,\
  \ Pinkerton, Peris, Perisc, Periscope, Boo Boo, Conceptalbum, Wherwithal, Fanfares,\
  \ Desk Sergeant Greasejacket, Desk Sergeant Greasejacket's performing monkey, Flamboyant\
  \ Man, Elspeth Duckwind, Lavengro, Rasselas, Pompidou and Vampire, Threadbare, Pot,\
  \ Gack, Snap, Tiddlepan, Forlorn, Riskassessor, Kow Fat Loon, Hoon Bat Lim, Goon\
  \ Fang, Chow Hang Lip, Kim Park Goong, Trilby Baxter, Serp, Slop, Shandy, Martinamis,\
  \ Woolgatherer, Poopsie Clutterbuck, Poopsie Clutterbuck's crippled nephew Simon,\
  \ whose name was Peter, a pool of seconded temporary volunteers, and some horses,\
  \ all under the command of Super Captain Fausto Coppi, no relation to the legendary\
  \ cyclist of that name.\nThis is the kind of thing the O Cargpan! That Thou Were\
  \ With Us Still! readers adore. No doubt it took prodigious research to compile\
  \ that list of team-members, but those of us with a less specialist approach are\
  \ left wondering how, or even if, the case of the pod persons from Porlock was solved.\
  \ The author of the piece does not tell us, nor does she follow up the ramifications\
  \ of Cargpan's provision of a basket of fruit.\nLater in his career, of course,\
  \ like many fictional detectives, Detective Captain Cargpan had a trusty assistant,\
  \ a Watson to his Holmes. You will find no mention of Beppo in the umpteen thousand\
  \ pages of the bound volumes of O Cargpan! That Thou Were With Us Still! held in\
  \ the reference library at Pointy Town, nor in any of the myriad other journals\
  \ devoted to the cutting of Cargpan's crime-fighting chops. Beppo was not yet born\
  \ when the great detective joined the constabulary, and it was not until the famous\
  \ case of the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant that the diminutive\
  \ helpmeet appeared on the scene. Interestingly, this case is one that the aforementioned\
  \ Dr Watson attributed, in passing, to Sherlock Holmes. Watson made this something\
  \ of a habit, for he also tried to claim credit for a number of Cargpan & Beppo\
  \ adventures, including the singular affair of the aluminium crutch, the repulsive\
  \ story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby the banker, the arrest\
  \ of Wilson the notorious canary-trainer, and the one in which Isadora Persano,\
  \ the well-known journalist and duellist, was found stark staring mad with a matchbox\
  \ in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science.\n\
  Such true-life tales of detection and derring-do have thrilled generations. What\
  \ is less well-known is that when Cargpan eventually retired from the force, and\
  \ went off to some rustic backwater to keep bees and wasps, Beppo struck out on\
  \ his own as a private investigator. Very few of his solo adventures have ever been\
  \ made public, possibly due to their unremitting tedium. Poor Beppo was unfortunate\
  \ in that he was only ever employed by clients fretting about the state of their\
  \ taps, or their hedges, or a defective electric socket, or a cat in a tree, or\
  \ a lost bus pass. He took to drink, and was last heard of wandering aimlessly around\
  \ the gloomy suburbs of Tantarabim, emitting noxious fumes with every breath, and\
  \ shouting his head off at snackbar hooligans.\n[2007-04-22]"
