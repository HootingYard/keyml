text: "As an adjunct to my Maddinathon, I investigated the work of Guy Maddin's old\
  \ mucker in the Winnipeg Film Group, John Paizs. Paizs directed, among other films,\
  \ Top Of The Food Chain (1999), a highly amusing homage to 1950s alien invasion\
  \ movies.\nI mention it here because it is a film that can be watched with real\
  \ pleasure by those of us bored to tears by those endless examples of what one critic\
  \ has dubbed \u201Cthe cinema of Pointy Town\u201D. Indeed, one could get no further\
  \ from Pointy Town than the setting of a key scene, where the atomic scientist Dr\
  \ Karel Lamonte (who works at the Atomic Academy) reports: \u201CWe found the remains\
  \ of a dead human corpse, deceased, in the hilly, lumpy, bumpy part of town outside\
  \ of town.\u201D\nAs if to drive home the anti-Pointy Town point, the \u201Clumpy,\
  \ bumpy part of town outside of town\u201D is pointedly mentioned several times.\n\
  Hooting Yard Rating\_: dozens upon dozens of bright pointy stars.\n[2011-02-14]"
