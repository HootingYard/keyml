text: "One of Dobson's more ambitious projects was The Complete Anatomy Of Birds,\
  \ Described In Majestic Sweeping Prose In Several Hefty Volumes. Uncharacteristically,\
  \ he kept this one under his hat, and did not discuss its progress with his inamorata\
  \ Marigold Chew over breakfast.\n\u201CI am puzzled,\u201D said Marigold one morning,\
  \ smearing compacted gunk on to a wafer of dough, \u201CYour usual practice is to\
  \ babble incontinently to me over breakfast about whatever it is you are writing,\
  \ yet for the past week or so you have either been silent or have spoken of quite\
  \ other matters. Is everything hunky dory in the Dobson head?\u201D\n\u201C'Hunky\
  \ dory\u2019 does not begin to describe it,\u201D said Dobson, after swallowing,\
  \ with some difficulty, a mouthful of runny egg \u2018n\u2019 cheese-straw bap,\
  \ \u201CI have embarked upon what may be my greatest achievement, the one I will\
  \ be remembered for after I am gone. I have not spoken of it to you because I fear\
  \ you will dissuade me from tackling a work of several hefty volumes, advising me\
  \ instead to stick with mere pamphlets.\u201D\n\u201CWell, you are a pamphleteer,\
  \ Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, dallying with a stray pea on her plate, \u201C\
  But I have every confidence in your ability to write several hefty volumes, so long\
  \ as you choose a subject you know something about. I might throw up my hands in\
  \ horror, however, were you to be so delusional as to think you could write sensibly\
  \ at length on a topic of which you are blitheringly ignorant.\u201D\n\u201CSuch\
  \ as?\u201D asked Dobson, who was ever loth to admit that there just might be one\
  \ or two things in the universe that he knew nothing about.\n\u201CBirds,\u201D\
  \ said Marigold.\nAs she spoke, there was a thunderclap. Rain lashed against the\
  \ windows, and the sky grew dark.\n\u201CAs it happens,\u201D said Dobson, \u201C\
  I am at work on chapter one of book one of The Complete Anatomy Of Birds, Described\
  \ In Majestic Sweeping Prose In Several Hefty Volumes.\u201D\nMarigold Chew threw\
  \ up her hands in horror, inadvertently upsetting a tumbler of unaerated potato\
  \ juice.\n\u201CGod help us,\u201D she said.\n\u201CVolume One is entitled The Beak,\
  \ and my plan is to devote at least four hundred pages to that fascinating topic,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson.\n\u201CMay I ask,\u201D said Marigold, \u201CHow much you have written\
  \ thus far?\u201D\n\u201CJust a couple of lines,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CI admit\
  \ it is slow work. But I am kept busy with my research.\u201D\n\u201CAnd those two\
  \ lines are . . .?\u201D asked Marigold.\n\u201CAll birds have beaks, I think,\u201D\
  \ quoted Dobson, \u201CCommonly, they are located on the lower front part of a bird's\
  \ head.\u201D\n\u201CWould it be fair to say,\u201D continued Marigold Chew, mercilessly,\
  \ \u201CThat you have turned to your research, whatever that might be, because you\
  \ have exhausted your knowledge of the beaks of birds?\u201D\nBut answer came there\
  \ none, for Dobson, pretending to a sudden but delayed terror of the thunderclap,\
  \ had scurried under the breakfast table, as if he were James Joyce during a thunderstorm\
  \ in Scheveningen.\nLater that day, he abandoned his bird book, and wrote instead\
  \ that timeless classic among his pamphlets, How I Hid Under A Table During A Thunderstorm\
  \ And Ruined My Trousers By Kneeling In A Puddle Of Unaerated Potato Juice, And\
  \ What This Tells Us About The Human Spirit In Extremis (out of print).\n[2013-05-05]"
