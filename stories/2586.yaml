text: "I have just heard someone on the news talking about \u201Cthe new lens\u201D\
  . He did not explain the nature of this optical device, nor whether it was a replacement\
  \ for an old lens fallen into disrepair or desuetude. As far as I can gather, from\
  \ the meagre information provided, the new lens is the device through which everything\
  \ henceforth ought to be viewed\u2014or perhaps peered at, myopically, with much\
  \ befuddled blinking. I will be placing an order for a goodly supply of the new\
  \ lenses, if more than one is available, so rest assured that your favourite website\
  \ will on no account be regarding the world in some hopelessly old fashioned way.\
  \ Take due note\u2014Hooting Yard! Forward With The New Lens!\n[2009-07-07]"
