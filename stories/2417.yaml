text: "Bear with me while I quote once again from Fors Clavigera by John Ruskin, but\
  \ this is wonderful. One's only regret is that there is no illustration of the work\
  \ described.\n[I]t happened that on the very day on which I published my last letter,\
  \ I had to go to the Kensington Museum ; and there I saw the most perfectly and\
  \ roundly ill-done thing which, as yet, in my whole life I ever saw produced by\
  \ art. It had a tablet in front of it, bearing this inscription, \u2013\n\u201C\
  Statue in black and white marble, a Newfoundland Dog standing on a Serpent, which\
  \ rests on a marble cushion, the pedestal ornamented with pietra dura fruits in\
  \ relief.\u2014English. Present century. No. I.\u201D\nIt was so very right for\
  \ me, the Kensington people having been good enough to number it \u201CI.,\u201D\
  \ the thing being almost incredible in its one-ness ; and, indeed, such a punctual\
  \ accent over the iota of Miscreation,\u2014so absolutely and exquisitely miscreant,\
  \ that I am not myself capable of conceiving a Number two, or three, or any rivalship\
  \ or association with it whatsoever. The extremity of its unvirtue consisted, observe,\
  \ mainly in the quantity of instruction which was abused in it. It showed that the\
  \ persons who produced it had seen everything, and practised everything ; and misunderstood\
  \ everything they saw, and misapplied everything they did. They had seen Roman work,\
  \ and Florentine work, and Byzantine work, and Gothic work ; and misunderstanding\
  \ of everything had passed through them as the mud does through earthworms, and\
  \ here at last was their worm-cast of a Production,\nFrom Letter V. Whitethorn Blossom\n\
