text: "I am often asked what it was like to be borp. For example, I may be leaning\
  \ insouciantly against a mantelpiece at a swish sophisticated cocktail party when\
  \ a fellow-guest will approach me, sometimes in a wheelchair, and say: \u201CI'm\
  \ told you were borp. I don't suppose you'd care to tell me about that, would you?\u201D\
  \ Or I may be queueing in the post office to buy a postage stamp or two, when the\
  \ person behind me, sometimes on crutches, will tap me on the shoulder and say:\
  \ \u201CI could tell by looking at the back of your head that you were borp. What\
  \ was it like?\u201D Every so often, I am asked in writing, usually in a crabbed\
  \ and barely legible hand.\nI wish I could say that I try to give a full and frank\
  \ answer. I wish I could say I responded, at least, politely. But I do not.\nMy\
  \ usual tactic is to gibber like unto a monkey, toss my not so golden locks, what's\
  \ left of them, and execute a little pirouette. I then remove from my blazer pocket\
  \ a crucifix, kiss it, and set it on fire with my Ignitofab lighter.\nAs Perkins\
  \ run through with a rapier, so Himmelfarb bewildered in the gloaming. There are\
  \ things fit only for the ears of those who dwell in Cretin Town. Was it Browning\
  \ who wrote about \u201Cthe bough of cherries some officious fool / Broke in the\
  \ orchard\u201D? There are no fools in my orchard any longer. I sent them packing,\
  \ one by one, from Thursday through to the following Monday, yes, even on the Lord's\
  \ Day I chased a fool from my orchard, by dint of borp.\nWish me Godspeed, and count\
  \ the circle of toads, for borp is borp and shall ever be as never be in witlessness\
  \ and pox.\n[2017-07-30]"
