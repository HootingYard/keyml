  \ in Ulm:\nThe annual Festival of Argumentative Music in Ulm has become a highlight\
  \ on the calendar for lovers of grumpy German improv jazz, and this year they received\
  \ a special treat with a performance by grumpy German improv jazz titan Horst Blot.\
  \ With his usual septet augmented by glockenspiel, steam hammers, Japanese cardboard\
  \ trombone, and an electronically-enhanced janitor's mop, Blot devoted his entire\
  \ four-hour set to a startling reinvention of the old jazz standard Chutney On My\
  \ Spats.\nUnfortunately, I was not able to attend the concert. I had a very trying\
  \ day. In the morning I had an ague and the quinsy, and then shortly after lunch\
  \ I was stricken by jellybrain and cork-in-the-ears. In addition, I had to deal\
  \ with a gas leak and a letter demanding the return of an overdue library book.\
  \ The final straw was the discovery that my press pass had expired, meaning I would\
  \ have to pay out of my own pocket for a ticket to the Festival. Horst Blot may\
  \ well be a grumpy German improv jazz titan, but I am not going to open my wallet\
  \ for him.\nInstead, I waited until the next day to read the review in Godawful\
  \ Racket magazine. What a load of codswallop! It was written by Primrose Dent, who\
  \ opined that the music was, among other things, searing, bippety-boppety, tough,\
  \ chewy, Machiavellian, plinky-plonky, mordant, splenetic, sunlit, dappled, goosebumpy,\
  \ tenebrous, and \u201Ca bit like a choc ice\u201D. In other words, she simply pulled\
  \ a load of adjectives out of a bag and strung them together.\nNow I have done exactly\
  \ the same thing, in some of my reports from Ulm, in the days when I used to have\
  \ a valid press pass. I wrote out hundreds of adjectives on hundreds of scraps of\
  \ paper, stuffed them into a pippy bag and then plucked out a few dozen each time\
  \ I had to write an article on, say, the bus stops of Ulm, or the gazebos of beekeepers\
  \ in Ulm, or indeed an earlier Horst Blot concert at the Festival of Argumentative\
  \ Music in Ulm, where he played a shorter, three-and-a-half-hour version of Chutney\
  \ On My Spats, without the glockenspiel, steam hammers, Japanese cardboard trombone,\
  \ and electronically-enhanced janitor's mop, but with a steam glockenspiel, a Japanese\
  \ cardboard mop, and a bowl of rice pudding. My articles may have been codswallop\
  \ too, but they were emotionally-wrenching codswallop which elicited great heaving\
  \ sobs from my readers. I know this because they used to write to me, although I\
  \ was never able to read their letters, smudged as they were with salty tears.\n\
  When I have recovered my wits I shall write a letter to Godawful Racket magazine\
  \ pointing out that Primrose Dent has been deaf as a post since that episode in\
  \ the wind tunnel at the aerodrome. She also puts her adjectives in the wrong sort\
  \ of bag.\nOver and out, Your Man In Ulm.\n[2014-08-06]"
