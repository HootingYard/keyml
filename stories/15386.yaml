text: "Yesterday I went to see the new Walt Dinsey [sic] film Beauty And The Beast.\
  \ (I know, I know. Don't ask.) A more fitting title would have been Feisty Bookworm\
  \ And The Prince With Bad Table Manners. Belle, the Beauty, as played by Emma Watson,\
  \ is feisty, and a bookworm. The only other thing to note about her character is\
  \ that she has a rather problematic relationship with her father's horse, but we\
  \ shall come to that.\nThe putative Beast (one Dan Stevens) is hardly bestial. I\
  \ was expecting something like the Grunty Man, that awful figure of children's nightmares.\
  \ Other than being a bit hairy, sporting a pair of goaty horns, and growling occasionally,\
  \ this so-called Beast seems perfectly civilised. He speaks in a mellifluous RADA-trained\
  \ voice not unlike that of the late Alan Rickman, and has a well-stocked library.\
  \ The extent of his bestiality seems to be that he slurps his soup straight from\
  \ the bowl. Franz Kafka had worse table manners (his father used to hide behind\
  \ the newspaper when dining with FK).\nNow, about that horse. Its name is Philippe.\
  \ The Feisty Bookworm arrives at the castle astride Philippe. We then see neither\
  \ hide nor hair of the horse until, after an indeterminate period\u2014days? weeks?\
  \ months?\u2014the Beast frees the Bookworm so she can rescue her father from imminent\
  \ incarceration in a lunatic asylum. Suddenly, there is Philippe, fit as a fiddle,\
  \ ready to gallop back to the village. Where has he been all this time? The Feisty\
  \ Bookworm has expressed not a jot of concern for him, and we have seen no sign\
  \ of a stable, nor even a trough. It is all very mysterious.\nHooting Yard Rating\_\
