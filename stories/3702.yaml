text: "One blustery and bitter springtime morning, Tiny Enid decided to make a goodly\
  \ supply of bathtub gin. The plucky tot was wholly ignorant about the distillation\
  \ of spiritous liquors, but she was a resourceful girl, and so she clumped with\
  \ great determination along the streets, past the duckpond and the hazardous waste\
  \ facility, to her local library. Now, it may surprise some younger readers, but\
  \ in those days of Tiny Enid's tinydom, libraries were filled with books, and had\
  \ not yet become chat \u2018n\u2019 snack zones for diverse and vibrant hoodie teenpersons.\
  \ So the heroic infant was able to gen up on all she needed to know about the making\
  \ of bathtub gin by consulting a selection of large and impressive volumes in the\
  \ reference section. Having crammed her sparkling brain with information, Tiny Enid\
  \ picked up all the things she would need as she made her way home, taking a different\
  \ route which took her past the badger sanctuary and the moonshine supplies emporium.\n\
  With her usual excessive, if not deranged, zeal, Tiny Enid set to work, and soon\
  \ had a bathtub full of gin. This she decanted into a jerrybuilt vat, and proceeded\
  \ with a second bathtubful. Only when the vat was filled to the brim with rotgut\
  \ gin did Tiny Enid relax, sitting down in her favourite armchair, smoking a cheroot,\
  \ and listening to gramophone records of Xavier Cugat And His Orchestra.\nWhile\
  \ at the library, Tiny Enid had taken the opportunity to borrow an instructive book,\
  \ by Gabbitas, entitled Large-Scale Sabotage Of Civic Plumbing Infrastructure. She\
  \ speed-read this while gobbling down her supper of jugged hare and bloater paste\
  \ sandwiches, so that before bedtime she was able to pipe her vat of bathtub gin\
  \ into the local water supply.\nBy the afternoon of the following day, Tiny Enid\
  \ was pleased to note that the whole town was a scene of moral degradation and unparalleled\
  \ debauch, a Hogarth print come to life. She checked that her vat was now empty,\
  \ readjusted the piping system back to normal, plunked a cloche hat on her head,\
  \ and went out into the teeming streets to set the world to rights.\nMany, many\
  \ years later, when she wrote her Memoirs, Tiny Enid explained:\nIt can be difficult\
  \ to imagine the frustrations of a brave, adventurous tot, such as I was, growing\
  \ up in a peaceable, indeed an idyllic, little townlet. Those who have read Lark\
  \ Rise To Candleford by Flora Thompson, or watched the television adaptation, may\
  \ have some idea how few opportunities I was granted to perform acts of heroic derring-do,\
  \ when everybody was basically quite well-behaved and knew their place. I much preferred\
  \ situations of chaos and abandonment, in which I was able to assert my Fascist\
  \ Supertiny persona. The poisoning of the town's water supply with bathtub gin was\
  \ one of my more successful provocations. And while some might have used it to preach\
  \ and hand out temperance tracts, I had a good deal of fun kicking people in the\
  \ head and shouting my head off until they all sobered up. After that, they began\
  \ to realise who they were dealing with. They even struck a medal for me, to commemorate\
  \ the way in which I dragged the town back from the brink of moral collapse.\nMy\
  \ oh my, she was a proper caution, that Tiny Enid.\n[2010-01-18]"
