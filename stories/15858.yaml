text: "Dobson once found himself marooned on a remote atoll. The circumstances were\
  \ inexplicable. He had a vague memory of toppling from the deck of a barquentine,\
  \ but could not recall what he was doing aboard the boat in the first place. Nor\
  \ did he remember how he came to be washed up on a barren sea-girt rock. But there\
  \ he was, and he had to lump it.\nAs a mostly deskbound pamphleteer, Dobson had\
  \ never found cause to undergo rigorous training in basic survival skills, so the\
  \ first few minutes on the atoll were emotionally wrenching, to say the least. In\
  \ fact Dobson could not recall such an emotionally wrenching experience since he\
  \ had attended a performance of Binder's third symphony. The conductor on that occasion\
  \ was the psychotic maestro Lothar Preen, and his approach to that piccolo and glockenspiel\
  \ business in the final movement caused in Dobson the welling up of the most wrenching\
  \ emotional experience he had ever had. He remembered the music as he sat slumped\
  \ on the atoll, staring at the sea, though the sound in his head was of an LP recording\
  \ conducted by Binder himself, where the piccolos and glockenspiel were slightly\
  \ less emotionally wrenching than in Preen's hands. Dobson was not overly fond of\
  \ what he considered Binder's somewhat clinical treatment of his own symphony. He\
  \ once wrote an intemperate letter to the composer, insisting that he rerecord all\
  \ the LPs of his music with more oomph, but tore it up before sending it, not from\
  \ second thoughts but because he did not have Binder's postal address and did not\
  \ at the time have the energy or wherewithal to hunt it down.\nEnergy and wherewithal,\
  \ however, were precisely what he needed to call upon if he were to survive his\
  \ maroonment on a remote atoll, and to his credit Dobson did not shilly-shally.\
  \ His first thought was of food, and then of water, and then of shelter. It was\
  \ almost as if he had undergone rigorous training in basic survival skills! He wondered\
  \ briefly if he had attended a course of instruction in a dream. Dobson often had\
  \ vivid dreams, and wrote down the details upon waking. He fossicked in the pockets\
  \ of his overcoat for his notebook, thinking that perhaps he might find a list of\
  \ hints and tips on basic survival skills scribbled down one dawn before the dream\
  \ faded. As he rummaged, his fingers fell upon something unfamiliar, and taking\
  \ it from his pocket he found he was clutching a packet of frozen crinkle-cut oven\
  \ chips.\nThe food problem, then, was solved, at least for the time being. Or so\
  \ Dobson thought. He could either suck the chips as he would ice lollies, or he\
  \ could lay them out on the atoll and let them thaw in the sunlight. Stupidly, he\
  \ decided on the latter. No sooner had he torn open the packet and laid the frozen\
  \ chips out in neat rows upon the barren rock than a formidable flock of seagulls\
  \ came swooping out of the sky and snatched up every single chip in their terrible\
  \ beaks. Thus Dobson experienced a third wrenching of the emotions, perhaps the\
  \ most emotionally wrenching to date. Such was its intensity that Dobson leapt to\
  \ his feet and shook his fist at the sky and screamed his head off at the seagulls.\
  \ But the seagulls had already flown far far away, perhaps to another atoll, where\
  \ they would perch awhile and scoff their crinkle-cut chips. Seagulls will eat anything.\n\
  A little sprite within Dobson's head told him that he was wasting his energy, so\
  \ he sat down and gazed about him. This was when he noticed that there were various\
  \ creatures, such as barnacles and limpets and mussels, clinging to the rock. They\
  \ were not frozen and did not need thawing. He wrote the word \u201CFood\u201D in\
  \ his notebook and placed a tick next to it.\nDobson had read a number of books\
  \ about atoll maroonment, and it was the memory of these he now drew upon. He could\
  \ collect rainwater in his upturned hat, for example. It was not raining, but Dobson\
  \ was wearing a yachting cap, so he took this off and placed it, upside down, on\
  \ as level a patch of rock as he could find. As he did so, he felt a pang of great\
  \ perplexity, for he could not remember ever seeing the yachting cap before. How\
  \ had he come to be wearing it? It must be connected in some way to the barquentine\
  \ from which he had a vague recollection of having toppled into the sea. It was\
  \ not the sort of headgear he would normally choose to wear. He was a Homburg man\
  \ through and through, except for those occasions when he sported a floppy and shapeless\
  \ thingummy or a battered leaden crown. But stylish or not, the yachting cap would\
  \ catch rainwater, if and when rain fell. Dobson looked up at the sky, and saw a\
  \ cloud. It was quite white, and very high above him. It only bloomed for minutes,\
  \ and when he looked up again, it vanished on the air. He took his notebook, wrote\
  \ the word \u201CWater\u201D, and placed a question mark next to it.\nThe last item\
  \ on his agenda was shelter. It was a particularly wrenching emotional moment when\
  \ he admitted to himself that there was no sign either of foliage or of a tatty\
  \ tarpaulin abandoned by a previous maroonee. Dobson was at the mercy of the elements.\
  \ He thought of that passage in Binder's tenth symphony when the four elements are\
  \ evoked by mordant bassoon toots, and he began to weep.\nThen he remembered something\
  \ else he had read in one of those books, that always, sooner or later, a ship full\
  \ of Jesuits would appear, and one need only dance and hop like a mad thing, waving\
  \ one's arms, and they would sail in to the rescue. Or perhaps it was the Jesuit\
  \ who was marooned, and the ship's crew were just ordinary sailors. Whichever way\
  \ round it was, the dancing and hopping and waving was the important thing. And\
  \ so he practised those disciplines, with great vim and vigour, while munching thirstily\
  \ on barnacles, until a ship hove into view on the horizon. It was the HMS Gerard\
  \ Manley Hopkins, and it took him home at last.\nOriginally posted in 2012.\n[2017-11-05]"
