  \ for \u201Cmoorhen\u201D+\u201Dmezzotint\u201D, nearly all the results linked to\
  \ Hooting Yard. I explained to him that all interweb searches lead eventually, by\
  \ twists and turns, back to here, for it is the uberhub lying at the centre of the\
  \ entire network, a sort of throbbing pulse from which all else emanates. What I\
  \ must do, one day, is to discover which single Hooting Yard postage lies at the\
  \ very core of the hub, is the glistening jewel which, by who knows what mighty\
  \ and mysterious forces, has generated everything else on the interweb. I would\
  \ not be surprised to find that the postage in question is something to do with\
  \ plucky tot Tiny Enid.\nSpeaking of whom, here is a rare picture of Tiny Enid in\
  \ later life, taking a break from writing her Memoirs.\n\n[2010-02-07]"
