text: "Today's Grauniad has an article asking if Brighton is the \u201Chippest city\
  \ in Britain\u201D, whatever that might mean. (I have not provided a link to the\
  \ piece, for I feel sure Hooting Yard readers have better things to do with their\
  \ time.) I mention it only to note that a far more cogent question would be \u201C\
  Is Pointy Town The Pointiest Town In The Known Universe?\u201D Unfortunately, this\
  \ would not fill much space in a newspaper, as the answer is quite obviously \u201C\
  Yes, it is\u201D. One could I suppose extrapolate upon the most pointy of the pointy\
  \ attractions of Pointy Town, and perhaps one day soon I shall do so. But will the\
  \ Grauniad publish it?\n[2010-05-19]"
