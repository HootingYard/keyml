  And then my eyes saw, standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by scum-pools, the\

  \ just at the moment my peering, watery eyes would have seen that\u2026 that thing,\
  \ I was startled by a toad, which leapt up at my face, and thwacked me on the forehead,\
  \ leaving an imprint which remains there to this day, like a brand.\nThe narrator\
  \ of part one then turns up in part two as The Man With The Mark Of The Toad! (He\
  \ invariably attracts an exclamation mark.)\nNow, years later, far far away and\
  \ banished to a pompous land, Mr Mike Jennings has unearthed this piece of comic\
  \ book art by the creator of Spiderman, one Steve Ditko. An eerie premonition \u2026\
