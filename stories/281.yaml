  \ circumstances,\u201D he replies.\n\u2013 From an interview with Dr Muhammad Abdul\
  \ Bari, leader of the Muslim Council of Britain, in the Daily Telegraph, 10th November\
  \ 1007\u2026 sorry, 2007.\nIt goes without saying that stoning to death is the only\
  \ proper way of dealing with certain crimes, but as Dr Bari so wisely says, one\
  \ has to be clear about what sort of stoning. That is why Hooting Yard is pleased\
  \ to announce a soon-to-be-out-of-print pamphlet entitled How To Choose The Right\
  \ Sort Of Stoning To Death For Ne'er-Do-Wells. This helpful work gives tips on many\
  \ different techniques of throwing rocks at defenceless women until they are dead.\n\
