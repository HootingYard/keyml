text: "I've said it before and I'll say it again\_: reportage is the lifeblood of\
  \ Hooting Yard. The reason I say it again is to drum it into your heads. There is\
  \ a distressing number of readers who seem to believe that I make all of this stuff\
  \ up. Quite apart from the sheer foolishness of doing so, I am ever mindful of B.\
  \ S. Johnson's dictum \u201CTelling stories is telling lies\u201D. And, as Lennox\
  \ and Stewart put it so cogently, \u201CWould I lie to you?\u201D You need not attempt\
  \ to answer that now, just read on, mes braves!\nTo bolster Hooting Yard's reputation\
  \ as a respectable space age information provider, I have decided to appoint a Fact\
  \ Check Team. They will go about their business independently, without fear or favour,\
  \ digging and rummaging and fossicking where their piercingly-honed instincts take\
  \ them. If it should so happen that they come upon an instance of inaccuracy or\
  \ outright lying, I will accept their ruling and remove the offending postage, replacing\
  \ it with a correction written by the team. I will even so arrange things that the\
  \ correction appears in big bright red bold capital letters, accompanied perhaps\
  \ by a skull-and-crossbones symbol such as one sometimes finds on bottles of poison.\
  \ That should liven things up!\nSo let me introduce you to the team. There are three\
  \ members, each of whom graduated, if that is the word I want, from Pang Hill Orphanage.\
  \ Bim and Bam and Little Nitty each have long experience of the kind of painstaking\
  \ drudgery necessary to hunt down the facts, although in their case the painstaking\
  \ drudgery they experienced was sewing mailbags in a dank cellar by the light of\
  \ a single Toc H lamp. I have always been a great believer in transferable skills.\n\
  I am also a great believer in the benefits of fresh air and hiking and long jaunts\
  \ in the open air. That is why Bim and Bam and Little Nitty will do their fact-checking\
  \ in \u201Cthe field\u201D or \u201Con the ground\u201D, out and about. In any case,\
  \ I do not want them cluttering up my chalet o\u2019 prose and whimpering and eating\
  \ me out of house and home. They can forage for nuts and berries and fresh puddlewater\
  \ when they are in the field or on the ground.\nIn order to decide what the trio\
  \ should investigate first, I conducted a lightning readers\u2019 poll. \u201COn\
  \ what topic,\u201D I asked, \u201Ccan Bim and Bam and Little Nitty cut their chops\
  \ as a tiptop fact check team?\u201D Typical of the response I received\u2014sorry,\
  \ I mean to say \u201Cresponses\u201D plural, because I did ask more than one reader,\
  \ honestly, cross my heart and hope to ascend in glory to the ethereal realms\u2014\
  was this, from one T. Thurn:\nDear Mr Key,\n    Last night I lay awake tossing and\
  \ turning and biting and pummelling my Plumpo!\u2122 pillow, bereft of even a second\
  \ of shut-eye because I am so desperate to know if the orchard and hotel and squirrels\
  \ referred to in Alfred Pigtosser's autobiography I, Alfred Pigtosser actually exist.\
  \ And if they do, I have supplementary questions, not so much about the squirrels\
  \ but regarding the orchard and hotel. They can wait, however, until Bim and Bam\
  \ and Little Nitty have ascertained the brute reality or otherwise of the orchard\
  \ and the hotel and the squirrels and reported back, exhausted from their hike or\
  \ jaunt, having cut their chops.\n    Yours with bated but minty breath,\n    T.\
  \ Thurn\nI think you would have liked the next scene. \u201CBim! Bam! Little Nitty!\u201D\
  \ I called, in my most stentorian boom. They shuffled in, spindly and unkempt and\
  \ dribbling. Terry-Thomas would have dismissed them as an absolute shower!, but\
  \ I had every confidence in my fact check team. \u201CHere,\u201D I said, \u201C\
  Take these three partly prepaid bus tickets, go to the bus stop, and wait for a\
  \ bus. When eventually a bus arrives, board it and take it as far out into the countryside\
  \ as it goes. Then ring the bell and alight and go in search of the orchard and\
  \ hotel and squirrels mentioned in Alfred Pigtosser's autobiography I, Alfred Pigtosser.\
  \ And don't get up to any mischief or it's back to Pang Hill Orphanage with you!\u201D\
  \n\u201CPlease Mr Key,\u201D whimpered one of them, Bim or Bam or Little Nitty,\
  \ in a weak thin quavering voice, \u201CHow are we to survive in the countryside\
  \ when we are used to being given a bowl of gruel once a day at grueltime?\u201D\
  \nI gave each of them a hefty slap on the back and boomed \u201CFear not! The Lord\
  \ will provide! And if He does not, because your prayers are insufficiently abject,\
  \ then I am sure you will find opportunities to forage for nuts and berries and\
  \ fresh puddlewater! Now off you go, before I summon the beadle to drag you back\
  \ to the orphanage!\u201D\nThe last I saw of them, they were trudging disconsolately\
  \ to the bus stop. I have no doubt, however, that at this very moment they are far\
  \ away on some bleak blasted heath or moor, their vitals stimulated by all that\
  \ unaccustomed fresh air, diligently seeking signs of an orchard and a hotel and\
  \ some squirrels. As soon as they report back, assuming they can cobble together\
  \ the bus fares for the return journey, I will let you know. And I will publish\
  \ their report in full. It will, I am sure, confirm the existence of that orchard\
  \ and that hotel and those squirrels. Then T. Thurn can fire at me as many supplementary\
  \ questions as he likes.\n[2012-09-09]"
