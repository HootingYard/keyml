text: 'From 1973 to 1975 Auberon Waugh wrote a regular column for the New Statesman.
  So unlikely was this alliance that Waugh gave the apposite title In The Lion''s
  Den to a 1978 book collecting fifty of his pieces. In the introduction, he described
  the imaginary New Statesman reader he was addressing:

  My image of the New Statesman reader was that of a taut, slightly embittered female
  school-teacher, possibly in Coventry but certainly in one of the less well-favoured
  areas of the country, struggling valiantly against the inherited and environmental
  disabilities of her charges to preserve some quasi-theological Hope in the socialist
  future. She was a convinced atheist and a convinced progressive in sexual matters
  although her own experiences in that field had seldom been encouraging. In foreign
  affairs she was endlessly progressive but in home affairs subject to strange disciplinarian
  urges which might suddenly demand unspeakable punishments not only for racists,
  rapists and male chauvinists, but also for litter-louts, cigarette-smokers and males
  generally. She approved of homosexuality and unmarried mothers, disapproved of drink
  and drugs, approved of education, disapproved of anyone excelling in it, approved,
  rather nervously, of the working class in most of its manifestations except football
  hooliganism and represented, in fact, the only surviving bastion of middle class
  values.
