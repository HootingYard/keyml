text: 'O show us the way to the next Brecht symposium. O don''t ask why, o don''t
  ask why. For we must find the next Brecht symposium and spout twaddle, or if we
  don''t attend the plenary session and spout twaddle I tell you we must die, I tell
  you we must die, I tell you, I tell you, I tell you we must lose out on tenure in
  a professorship in Brecht studies at an important university where we can be paid
  handsomely to spout twaddle until kingdom come, which is surely not unlike death,
  in a spiritual sense, is it not, Lars?
