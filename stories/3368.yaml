text: "Two unrelated matters of note to draw to your attention. I was going to write\
  \ \u201Ctwo unrelated headlines\u201D, but \u201Cheadline\u201D suggests news, and\
  \ one of these is not only three years old but was not a \u201Cnews headline\u201D\
  \ even then.\nThough having said they are unrelated it now occurs to me that one\
  \ could in fact connect the two, or imagine a scenario in which they were jammed\
  \ together, for example, by using the contraption in (A) to view the incident in\
  \ (B).\n(A), then, is Build Your Own Dobsonian Telescope. Tragically\u2014and I\
  \ am quite clear about the usage of that word\u2014the Dobson in question is not\
  \ our beloved out of print pamphleteer, but another Dobson entirely. Still, to discover\
  \ that such a thing as a Dobsonian telescope exists, and that its creator might,\
  \ every now and then, be mistaken for our Dobson, is most pleasing.\n(B) is news\
  \ that a Japanese fishing trawler has been sunk by giant jellyfish. Unfortunately,\
  \ the details of the story are rather prosaic. You might want to skip them, and\
  \ instead imagine you are standing upon a promontory on the coast of Japan, peering\
  \ through your Dobsonian telescope at the terrible sight of a fishing boat being\
  \ attacked by a hideous semi-transparent sea monster with flailing tentacles.\n\
