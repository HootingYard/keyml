  \ in the midst of a waste of waters, far from kindred and friends, and the abodes\

  \ embarked with high hopes, lay within sight, a useless wreck; still we were enabled\
  \ to enjoy a moment of relief, if not of actual pleasure, derived from an event,\
  \ which, though trifling in itself, is worthy of being recorded.\n\u201CWe succeeded\
  \ in taking an eel, a few crabs, and a small quantity of snails. Having our fire-works\
  \ with us, we collected a sufficient number of sticks, with a few pieces of drift-wood\
  \ which had lodged upon the rock, to make a fire; with this we cooked our fish and\
  \ snails; and, with a small allowance of bread, we made what we then thought a sumptuous\
