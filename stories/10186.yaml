text: "Another Englishman who drew public attention to the Alps . . . was Albert Smith.\
  \ He was a prototype of the young hiker, camper and mountaineer of to-day who, with\
  \ limited means, spends a short but infinitely precious holiday in the hills. Thus\
  \ far mountaineering had been, and was to be for many years, the almost exclusive\
  \ preserve of the eclectics, of Government officials, University dons and professional\
  \ men generally who with ample time and money at their disposal could afford long\
  \ holidays in the Alps and the expense of guides. In 1838, Smith, then twenty-two\
  \ years old, arrived at Chamonix with twelve pounds in his pocket. Instantly he\
  \ fell under the spell of the mountains and was so anxious to make the ascent of\
  \ Mont Blanc that he offered to go as a porter for anyone who would take him. He\
  \ failed in his ambition, but returned to the attack in 1851 with some Oxford undergraduates\
  \ who were delighted to climb with him when they learned that he was \u201CMr. Smith\
  \ of London, the well-known comic author\u201D. This time he succeeded, but the\
  \ ascent provoked much undesirable publicity. In the course of an article, the Daily\
  \ News wrote, \u201CDe Saussure's observations and reflections on Mont Blanc live\
  \ in his poetical philosophy; those of Mr. Albert Smith will be most appropriately\
  \ recorded in a tissue of indifferent puns and stale fast witticisms, with an incessant\
  \ straining after smartness. The aimless scramble of the four pedestrians to the\
  \ top of Mont Blanc . . . will not go far to redeem the somewhat equivocal reputation\
  \ of the herd of English tourists in Switzerland for a mindless and rather vulgar\
  \ redundance of animal spirits\u201D.\nBut Albert Smith remained unabashed. He was\
  \ by nature a born showman, and such are impervious to criticism and abuse. He wrote\
  \ an interesting and amusing book about Mont Blanc and, constructing a model of\
  \ the mountain, set out to describe it and his experiences to all and sundry. His\
  \ Mont Blanc in a Box show was a popular success and, however much it may have been\
  \ scorned by the eclectics, undoubtedly did much to bring the beauty and interest\
  \ of the Alps to the public attention.\nfrom British Mountaineers by F. S. Smythe\
