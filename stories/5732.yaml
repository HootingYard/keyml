text: "[Apropos the title, see here.]\nIn the early days of the regime, we attended\
  \ a briefing every morning at 0800 hours in the pavilion. One day, the Commodore\
  \ himself addressed us.\n\u201CMen,\u201D he said, \u201CIf the regime is to succeed,\
  \ and succeed it will, we must hunt down the nincompoops, the dunderpates, and the\
  \ chumps. They are legion. We must hunt them down, round them up, and then inject\
  \ their brains, one by one by one, with a serum. At this stage the serum is experimental,\
  \ but early tests on the brains of stoats show promise. You will know George A B\
  \ Dewar's dictum that \u2018craft, cruelty, concentration\u2014these, with a wonderful\
  \ suppleness, are the characteristics of the stoat\u2026 No animal\u2019 he goes\
  \ on to say, \u2018has the stoat's reputation for devilry\u2019. How true that is.\
  \ Yet once the serum has worked its way into their brain-jelly, the guinea pig stoats,\
  \ if I may use the term, become what we might call regime-fit. And it is an essential\
  \ part of our programme that our nincompoops and dunderpates and chumps, they too,\
  \ in their massive numbers, become regime-fit. So you will hunt them down, men,\
  \ starting today. Nincompoops commonly gather in chalets on mountainsides. The dunderpate\
  \ will be found in our cities, in the vicinity of important railway stations, or\
  \ queuing up at kiosks. As for chumps, they tend to inhabit nests, like vipers or\
  \ robins. You will be divided into three squadrons, with different-coloured socks,\
  \ and go hence on your essential mission. Any questions?\u201D\nMy hand shot up.\n\
  \u201CTo which squadron have I been assigned, O Commodore?\u201D I shouted, with\
  \ absolutely sincere enthusiasm.\nWith his mastery of detail, the Commodore was\
  \ able to rap back at me that I was to be second-in-command of Chump Squadron. My\
  \ socks would be gash-gold vermilion.\nLater that day, after clambering over a hedge\
  \ in the rain, I saw my first chumps\u2019 nest.\n\u201CLook!\u201D, I hissed to\
  \ my squadmate, \u201COver there, next to the pylon. If I am not mistaken, that\
  \ is a nest of chumps.\u201D\nThere were several foolish people, encamped in a sort\
  \ of bivouac, behaving foolishly, as chumps would, at a picnic, say.\n\u201CAch,\
  \ God!\u201D cried my squadmate, channelling Rupert Brooke, \u201CIs that not an\
  \ evocative sight?\u201D\n\u201CIs it?\u201D I replied, irritated. I was already\
  \ fossicking in my knapsack for the serum.\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said, \u201CDoes\
  \ it not evoke for you that wonderful poem by Dennis Beerpint? How does it go? We\
  \ ate breakfast in the coppice, squatting on our haunches. Our breakfasts were more\
  \ toothsome than our lunches. Something something something, in the shade of elms\
  \ and larches. We tried to stop the toast and jam from smearing our moustaches.\u201D\
  \n\u201CHave you taken leave of your senses?\u201D I snapped. \u201CFirst, it is\
  \ mid-afternoon, so whatever they are picnicking upon, those chumps are not engaged\
  \ in breakfast. Second, they are squatting under a looming electricity pylon, not\
  \ under elms and larches. And third\u2014\u201D\n\u201CYes, I suppose you are right,\u201D\
  \ he interrupted, \u201CBut still, it is an evocative sight. It seems such a pity\
  \ that we should destroy it by setting upon them and injecting their brains with\
  \ the serum.\u201D\n\u201CWe must do our duty,\u201D I said.\n\u201CWould Dennis\
  \ Beerpint have done his duty?\u201D he asked, irrelevantly. He reached into his\
  \ knapsack and took out a sketchpad and pencil. \u201CAt least let me capture the\
  \ essentials of this evocative scene with paper and pencil. Then when we are back\
  \ at camp I can work it up into one of my noted mezzotints.\u201D\nIt was then I\
  \ realised that my squadmate was none other than Rex Tint, the noted mezzotintist.\
  \ And thus I learned an invaluable lesson, about poetry, and mezzotints, and chumps,\
  \ and picnics in the rain. I poured the serum, every last drop of it, into a ditch,\
  \ and there and then I vowed to do all in my power to topple the regime. We never\
  \ returned to camp. Instead we joined the chumps in their nest, and shared their\
  \ toast and jam. I smeared some on my moustache. It felt like a badge of honour.\n\
