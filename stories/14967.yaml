text: 'I am a janitor at an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. I have a bucket and
  a mop and a bunch of keys. Sometimes I carry a screwdriver or a wrench or a hammer.
  My soul glows with a tremendous, overwhelming love of Christ.

  As I patrol the corridors with my bucket and mop and keys, I often find myself importuned
  by wannabe janitors. They dart from nooks and buttonhole me, jabbering questions
  about janitordom. I display excessive, some might say inhuman, patience with these
  intemperate pleading nitwits. Only very rarely do I smite one with my hammer.

  It is often cold, cold, oh! bitterly cold in Winnipeg. In the factory, the radiators
  need regular bleeding. When I carry out this duty, I try to concentrate my mind
  on the blood of Christ, which was shed for me, and for all sinners, even for the
  wannabe janitors, though they know it not.

  Sometimes I have to wipe the blood of a wannabe janitor from my hammer. I use an
  old frayed much-stained rag, which I then rinse out under a spigot and peg up to
  dry. I have seen the face of Christ in this rag, many times.

  Though I have been the janitor for untold years, I have never actually tasted the
  evaporated milk made in the factory. I have a horror of semi-sweetened evaporated
  dairy products, by dint of a childhood trauma. There was a picnic in the Blue Forgotten
  Hills, and a swarm of wasps, but more than that I cannot bring myself to say.

  Every now and then I might come upon a wasp when patrolling the corridors. I sink
  to my knees and take out my pocket catechism and I comfort myself with the sacred
  words. Sometimes, in spite of my prayers, I am so fearful of the wasp that I piddle
  in my pants. I rinse them under the spigot and peg them up alongside the blood-soaked
  rag. I hide in a broom cupboard to conceal my semi-nakedness until my pants are
  dry. On these occasions, I usually take off the rest of my clothing, so I can more
  readily imagine myself Adam in Eden. There is a painting of a serpent on the wall
  of the broom cupboard.

  Nunc dimittis.
