text: "When I saw advertisements for the imminent cinema release of Mud, I was bitterly\
  \ disappointed to learn that this is a brand new film. I had hoped it was a revival\
  \ of the original Mud, that classic film dun directed by wild-eyed auteur Horst\
  \ Gack.\n\nThe wrong Mud\nGack, of course, invented film dun, and was its greatest\
  \ practitioner. Unlike film noir, the archetypal film dun is shot entirely in shades\
  \ of dun. It was Horst Gack's peculiar genius to recognise that there could be no\
  \ better subject matter for a film in dun than mud. Thus, in Mud (1937), and its\
  \ sequel, Further Mud (1957), the camera gazes unflinchingly at patches of mud,\
  \ wholly dun in colour, without distracting the viewer with poltrooneries such as\
  \ characters and plot and car chases and big loud fiery explosions.\n\u201CMud is\
  \ a gripping experience,\u201D wrote the film critic Gervase Cravat in the October\
  \ 1937 issue of Cravat's Film Digest magazine, \u201CI, for one, will never look\
  \ at mud in the same way, ever again.\u201D\nHe returned to the subject in the following\
  \ month's issue.\nLast month I wrote that, having seen Horst Gack's Mud, I would\
  \ never look at mud in the same way, ever again. It is with a certain humility,\
  \ then, if not utter self-abasement, that I must admit I have indeed been looking\
  \ at mud in the same old way as I always did. The very next day after watching Mud,\
  \ I was taking a stroll in a sordid rustic backwater when I came upon an extensive\
  \ stretch of mud, dun in hue, and the thought popped into my head \u201CGosh, what\
  \ a lot of mud, just like all the other mud I have ever seen in my three score years\
  \ on earth\u201D, and I pranced on, towards the viaduct and the otter sanctuary,\
  \ dismissing the mud from my mind. Only when I got home several hours later, and\
  \ was making a cup of tea, preparatory to putting my feet up and whistling some\
  \ dance band tunes, did I realise that I had looked at the mud in the old way, as\
  \ if had never seen Horst Gack's film. This was highly disconcerting, so much so\
  \ that I tightened the cravat around my neck, forgot about the cup of tea, and immediately\
  \ wrote a mea culpa to Gack, confessing that his film had not, after all, had the\
  \ effect on me I thought it had had, but this was almost certainly my fault rather\
  \ than his. Knowing that unquestioning worship is the only proper approach to the\
  \ great auteur, I added that I would atone for my philistinism by returning to the\
  \ extensive stretch of mud, dun in hue, in the sordid rustic backwater, and mould\
  \ from it a dun-hued mud effigy of Horst Gack himself, double life-size, before\
  \ which I would prostrate myself several times a day, in between watching repeat\
  \ screenings of Mud. This I have done, every day since, and boy oh boy, let me tell\
  \ you, filmgoers, I am like unto a man transformed.\n[2013-05-10]"
