  \ made available by ResonanceFM's podcasting maestro. So here is the latest:\nOn\
  \ Sawdust Bridge, Harangued Click, listen, and learn.\n\nIn a couple of weeks\u2019\
  \ time, the show will celebrate its seventh anniversary. It is a pity, I think,\
  \ that back in 2004 neither I nor anyone else thought to apply Bl\xF6tzmann numbers\
  \ to the episodes. Scholars, researchers, and fools would have a much easier time\
  \ of it if they were able to refer to \u201CEpisode 149\u201D, say, instead of having\
  \ to identify shows by the original broadcast date. Perhaps a sensible person could\
  \ devote a portion of their otherwise worthless life to the creation of a numerical\
  \ index?\n[2011-03-31]"
