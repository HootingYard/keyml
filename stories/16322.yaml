text: "\u201CAm I not the helmsman here?\u201D I called out.\nMost of you, I hope,\
  \ will recognise this as the opening line of my Great Speech. It will certainly\
  \ be familiar to younger readers, who must learn the Great Speech by rote in their\
  \ kindergartens. Only when they have it by heart are they permitted to move on to\
  \ other essential topics, such as pig husbandry, Latin, and knitting. For the older\
  \ generation, we have made possession of the printed transcript compulsory. There\
  \ are several editions available, including one with cardboard covers and a lovely\
  \ frontispiece featuring a mezzotint by Dot Tint. Unfortunately, not all of these\
  \ editions are reliable, some containing misprints and even wilful interpolations\
  \ serving to twist my words. There have been several executions at the gibbets atop\
  \ Polkadot Hill.\nAs is well known, I delivered the Great Speech while standing\
  \ at the helm of a barge on an important stretch of canal, the better to illustrate\
  \ my point for the thickos in the audience. They probably comprised about ninety\
  \ per cent of those gathered on the towpath, if not more. It is quite astonishing\
  \ to recall that, in those antebellum days, the bulk of the population completed\
  \ their six months of kindergarten completely unable to husband a pig, speak Latin,\
  \ or knit.\nBut things have changed, and credit must be given to my Great Speech.\
  \ It was stirring, it was majestic, it was very loud, and it took four hours to\
  \ deliver. It was punctuated, as all my speeches are, with copious spitting. Before\
  \ I began speaking, I had the Earwax Squad move among the crowd with their little\
  \ wooden ear-prodders, to ensure every last thicko peasant would hear me properly.\
  \ They might not understand half of what I said, or any of it, but at least the\
  \ words would enter their ears unmuffled by wax.\nI was pleased with the rhetorical\
  \ flourish at the beginning of my speech, partly because I was daring anyone in\
  \ the crowd to contradict me. Doing so was made the more difficult by my standing\
  \ at the helm of the barge, wearing a bargee's cap. But you can never be sure with\
  \ the peasantry. As it was, nobody did try to deny that I was the helmsman, so I\
  \ was able to proceed without pause.\nI explained that the old days were over and,\
  \ quoting Blair, declared \u201Ca New Dawn has broken, has it not?\u201D, again\
  \ inviting contradiction. No voice was raised against me, so I pressed on. From\
  \ now on, there would be more and better pig husbandry. Latin would be the lingua\
  \ franca. Idle hands would be forced to knit in special new knitting camps, fenced\
  \ with barbed wire.\nI outlined other exciting features of the New Dawn, covering\
  \ everything from albatross slaughter to zoo regulations, with twenty-four other\
  \ alphabetically-ordered areas of urban and rustic life in between. I am not sure,\
  \ frankly, why I bothered to include urban matters, because the peasants gathered\
  \ by the canalside to hear me were the sort of peasants who, faced with something\
  \ urban, like a pavement or a street light or a civic art installation, would faint\
  \ or swoon or just topple over, in uncomprehending mental chaos.\nIndeed, quite\
  \ a large proportion of the crowd listening to my Great Speech seemed similarly\
  \ brain-bedizened. They stood there, gawping, open-mouthed, dribbling and drooling,\
  \ a slouching bunch of dimwits. These are the riffraff my regime of the New Dawn\
  \ will mould into terrifically energetic and Stakhanovite pig husbanders, Latin\
  \ speakers, and knitters.\nThat, at least, was the plan. But\u2014and it is a huge\
  \ but. Do they ever think, or do they only shuffle pointlessly over the earth?\n\
  The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Tania and James\
  \ Stern. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-03-09]"
