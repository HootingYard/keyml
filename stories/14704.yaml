  \ kept in a grand state room along with two rather sleepy full-grown tigers and\
  \ a governess. The governess spoke to the pangolin\u2014which was wearing a little\
  \ red pill-box hat\u2014in French. After observing these arrangements, I was escorted\
  \ from the Palace down a tree-lined pathway by the royal zookeeper, a grey-haired\
  \ man who expressed an interest in travelling to New York.\n[2016-06-05]"
