text: "Word of the day\_: Pencil.\nToday we are going to consider, in all its ramifications\
  \ and from every conceivable angle, the word pencil. Before we do so, however, imagine\
  \ yourself steaming open my correspondence and, with the aid of a flaming torch\
  \ in the darkness, reading the latest missive to plop onto the Key mat:\nDear Mr\
  \ Key\_: Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Poppy Nisbet and I am the downstairs\
  \ neighbour of your pesky serial Word of the Day correspondent Wlad Onanugu. Or,\
  \ should I say, I was his downstairs neighbour. I am pleased to say that the upstairs\
  \ flat is now empty, Mr Onanugu having been dragged away, very early this morning,\
  \ by a whirling tangle of ruffians dressed in police uniforms. Next stop\_: Durance\
  \ Vile, a barren rock far out at sea, from which no convict has ever escaped, and\
  \ where there are no stationery supplies. You will not be hearing from Mr O. again.\
  \ That will teach him to spit at one of my kittens in the hallway.\nI have innumerable\
  \ kittens, and I also have a great love of words, which is why your Word of the\
  \ Day series has proved such a tonic. At one point I was so damnably cheerful that\
  \ I even considered letting Mr Onanugu off the hook, and not making that call to\
  \ my pals on the Legally Questionable Abduction Team. The spat-upon kitten gazed\
  \ at me plaintively, however, and wiser counsels prevailed.\nAnyway, to business!\
  \ I am a very busy woman, so it is only today that I have found the time to enact\
  \ the illustrative sentence you gave for the word parp. I clattered into a room\
  \ full of tots, having first smeared my face with beetroot juice and boggled my\
  \ eyes. I then parped my hooter. I am pleased to say it was a roaring (or should\
  \ I say parping?) success.\nWhen I can find time within my schedule I intend to\
  \ act out all the words in your Word of the Day feature, whether or not you provide\
  \ an illustrative sentence. For verbs this should pose no serious challenge. As\
  \ for nouns, I have already resolved to make purchase of a mop and some glue and\
  \ a pencil, and will take it from there.\nI will not, however, be pestering you\
  \ with daily letters keeping you abreast of my doings, as I am mindful that you\
  \ only have limited space available for the Word of the Day, and I appreciate that\
  \ you must become exasperated when that space is taken up, as it is today, by foolish\
  \ wittering letters from your readers. I fear I have already prevented you from\
  \ paying due attention to pencil, thus increasing the backlog of words which you\
  \ still need to get to grips with if you are to maintain your dignity as a Word\
  \ of the Dayist. By my reckoning, that includes toot, hooter, tots, boggle, clunk,\
  \ glue, and nap..\nPerhaps I can be of assistance by performing some sort of stage\
  \ flummery utilising all those words at one fell swoop, and writing an account of\
  \ it for you. Then you would be able to put each and every one of them behind you\
  \ and \u201Cmove on\u201D, as the airheads say nowadays. First of all, though, I\
  \ must feed my kittens, and wipe them free of any neighbours\u2019 spittle.\nYours\
  \ terrifically, Poppy Nisbet\nI am most grateful to Ms Nisbet, and shall await her\
  \ report. In recognition of her efforts, I have decided that tomorrow's Word of\
  \ the Day will be nisbet.\n[2014-07-30]"
