text: "The drudgery of proofreadnig (second tranche) is done, I am pleased to say,\
  \ and pending a few final formatty fiddlesticks and decisions about the cover design,\
  \ the next Hooting Yard Lulu paperback will be ready\u2014after, I suppose, groaning,\
  \ a further proofread, just to be on the safe side.\nI have to say that a prolonged\
  \ bout of reading and rereading and rerereading my own stuff, in concentrated form,\
  \ is scarcely conducive to writing new-minted blather. That is why Hooting Yard\
  \ has gone a bit quiet over the last couple of weeks. I pause before tippy-tapping\
  \ on a new blank screen. Blah blah Dobson blah blah Blodgett blah blah cows blah\
  \ blah\u2026 there is an awful sense of futility. I know it will pass, and I know\
  \ too that I constantly need new material to prate on the radio once a week, so\
  \ all will be well.\nMeanwhile, instead of all the usual nonsense (ie, Dobson and\
  \ Blodgett and cows etc.) it occurred to me that I needed some kind of fresh challenge.\
  \ My eyes alit on this, snipped from the cover of some 1950s pulp magazine:\n\n\
  Could I write a novel of intrigue in the void? Isn't the point of a void that it\
  \ is empty, vacant, that there is nothing whatsoever in it? That's why it's a void!\
  \ What sort of intrigue takes place in a void? As soon as you put something into\
  \ it, to create or prompt an intrigue, surely it is no longer a void?\nThese are\
  \ mighty questions, and perplexing ones, but I do not think a mere list of questions,\
  \ however lengthy, would deserve to be called a novel. Or would it? Might the questions\
  \ themselves form the intrigue unravelling in the void? Or is that a circular self-referential\
  \ knot of twaddle, much like this postage itself?\nThese are less mighty questions,\
  \ yet just as perplexing, are they not? So perplexing that I am all a-dither. I\
  \ think I'll have a cup of tea, and then go for a walk, and then sit and dribble\
  \ into a pewter pot, gazing at the stars, up there in what would be a void if it\
  \ were not for the very stars with which it is riddled.\n[2010-09-11]"
