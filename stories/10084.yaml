text: "The Abnormal Butcher is the first in a series of potboilers bashed out by Pebblehead\
  \ in a frenzied fortnight of potboiling. He wrote a complete novel each day for\
  \ thirteen days and then, as he put it, \u201Con the fourteenth day, I rested\u201D\
  . It is not the first time Pebblehead has blasphemously compared himself to the\
  \ Almighty God, and it will not be the last.\nThe central character in the series\
  \ is Ned Mossop, the so-called \u201Cgluten-intolerant private eye\u201D. The matter\
  \ of his gluten intolerance is not explored by Pebblehead, merely stated. This is\
  \ not the only exasperating thing about the books. Were I to list the other exasperations\
  \ it would come to many more than thirteen items so, time being short, instead I\
  \ shall give a full list of all the titles in the series.\nThey are, in order of\
  \ both composition and publication, The Abnormal Butcher, The Cow Detective, The\
  \ Egg Freak, The Greasy Hinges, The Idiot Jar, The Knackered Latvian, The Mud-caked\
  \ Nuns, The Oblivious Pipsqueak, The Queasy Ratcatcher, The Snodgrass Thermometer,\
  \ The Uncanny Vase, The Wax Xylophone, and The Yobbo Zoo.\nAlthough, as the central\
  \ character, Ned Mossop is the only one to appear in all thirteen books, others\
  \ crop up here and there, having walk-on parts or popping their heads above the\
  \ parapet or being glimpsed in the distance getting up to some sort of mischief.\
  \ Thus for example, in The Snodgrass Thermometer, when Ned Mossop and Caligula Snodgrass\
  \ are engaged in a fight to the death on the edge of an Alpine crevasse, Pebblehead\
  \ turns his attention, for several pages, to Sister Assumpta, one of the mud-caked\
  \ nuns we met in the novel of that title. She is picking edelweiss a hundred yards\
  \ away from the crevasse, on a slightly higher slope. As readers, all we care about\
  \ is finding out who wins the impromptu boxing match between Mossop and Snodgrass.\
  \ It is thus highly exasperating of Pebblehead to prattle on about a mud-caked nun\
  \ to no apparent purpose. Why does he do it?\nThere are critics who claim that Pebblehead\
  \ is brilliantly undermining the conventions of the detective fiction genre. Consider,\
  \ for example, this excerpt from a review by Blossom Partridge, which appeared in\
  \ Miss Blossom Partridge's Weekly Digest:\nIn his new series of novels featuring\
  \ the gluten-intolerant private eye Ned Mossop, Pebblehead brilliantly undermines\
  \ the conventions of the detective fiction genre. For example, in The Queasy Ratcatcher,\
  \ Mossop is engaged in a fight to the death with the queasy ratcatcher on the edge\
  \ of an Alpine crevasse when Pebblehead magnificently turns his attention, for several\
  \ pages, to a clump of edelweiss on a slightly higher slope a hundred yards away.\
  \ The flowers are being examined, through some sort of optical scope contraption,\
  \ by Arpad Bogojugis, the knackered Latvian we met in the novel of that title. As\
  \ readers, all we are meant to care about is the outcome of the impromptu boxing\
  \ match on the edge of the crevasse, a hundred yards away and on a slightly lower\
  \ slope. By diverting our attention in this way, by frustrating our desires, Pebblehead\
  \ exasperates us to such an extent that we fling the paperback across the room into\
  \ the fireplace, or drop it into the bath, or rip it to shreds with our bare hands,\
  \ or otherwise damage it severely enough to render it unreadable.\nLater, when we\
  \ have calmed down over a nice cup of tea and some macaroons or Garibaldi biscuits,\
  \ we regret our fit of temper and begin to wonder (a) what Arpad Bogojugis learned\
  \ about the clump of edelweiss and (b) who won the impromptu boxing match. Try as\
  \ we might, we can get neither scene out of our head. Finally, draining our dainty\
  \ teacup and scoffing the last of the macaroons or Garibaldi biscuits, we put on\
  \ our stout walking boots and our windcheater and we sally forth into the storm\
  \ which is raging outside and go straight to the airport bookstall to buy a replacement\
  \ copy of The Queasy Ratcatcher. And we note there is a special offer whereby we\
  \ can purchase all thirteen volumes for the price of a baker's dozen, so we snap\
  \ them up, and pad out our shopping basket with a carton of teabags and a packet\
  \ of either macaroons or Garibaldi biscuits, and we head home, in the teeth of a\
  \ howling gale. Then we put the kettle on and look forward to reading the rest of\
  \ Pebblehead's utterly magnificent potboiler.\nI have a great deal of time for Blossom\
  \ Partridge, and I never miss an issue of her Weekly Digest, but in the case of\
  \ Pebblehead I think she is wrong. What we are dealing with, I would argue, is simple\
  \ narrative ineptitude. In fact, I have argued precisely this in an article I submitted\
  \ to Miss Blossom Partridge's Weekly Digest, in which I claim that success and blockbuster\
  \ sales have gone to Pebblehead's head, and that he sits there puffing on his pipe\
  \ in his so-called \u201Cchalet o\u2019 prose\u201D, bashing out his potboilers\
  \ at reckless speed, not caring one jot whether what he writes is even minimally\
  \ coherent or, indeed, readable. He knows that anything he produces will sell in\
  \ the millions. It has undone him.\nPOSTSCRIPT\_: Blossom Partridge has returned\
  \ the piece I wrote for her Weekly Digest. Her accompanying letter reads as follows:\n\
  Dear Mr Key,\nMuch as I was riveted, really really riveted, by your Pebblehead piece,\
  \ I am afraid I must reject it for publication because there is no space available\
  \ in the Weekly Digest. The next several issues are given over wholly to my extended\
  \ essay entitled Why I Have Had To Build A Large Storage Facility Adjacent To My\
  \ Modest Nook In Order To Contain My Ever-Growing Collection Of Duplicate Copies\
  \ Of Pebblehead Potboilers, Now Numbering In The Hundreds Of Thousands. I would\
  \ add a polite note to express my sincere regret, but I am afraid I must dash as\
  \ I have to head out in this terrible storm to the airport bookstall to purchase\
  \ a few dozen further Pebblehead paperbacks.\nYours in haste,\nBlossom Partridge\
  \ (Miss)\n[2012-09-06]"
