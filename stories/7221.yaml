text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, Always keen to keep abreast of the latest happenstances
  in popular culture, last evening I sat me down with a mug of cocoa and a bag of
  filberts to watch the Mercury Music Prize awards. I was saddened to see that young
  pop person Tinie Tempah, who was shortlisted, failed to win. Anyway, as I dabbed
  away my tears, it occurred to me to ask you if Master Tempah is in any way related
  to that other excellent tiny, Tiny Enid. Please enlighten me.

  Dear Tim, In this bewildering world it is critical that we can distinguish one tiny
  from another. Actually, that isn''t strictly true, now I come to think of it. What
  matters is that we can tell Tiny Enid apart from all other extant tinies.

  Tiny Enid is a heroic clubfooted infant, usually dressed in a polka dot frock, much
  given to brave, even reckless, deeds of derring-do, and of pronounced Fascist sympathies.

  I am not entirely sure who Tinie Tempah is, but I suspect he may be some kind of
  homunculus, possibly malevolent.

  I hope this clears the matter up to your satisfaction.
