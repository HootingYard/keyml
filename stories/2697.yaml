  \ Hooting Yard, but it is revivified and a-throb. Steam was pouring out of the funnels\
  \ late into the night. I saw it with my own eyes.\nActually, a couple of vague traces\
  \ of the boffins\u2019 work are apparent. The three postages from yesterday have\
  \ had to be reposted, and I have added the original date in the interests of fanatical\
  \ and pointless accuracy. Also, any comments made on those postages have vanished\
  \ into the murk, so I would ask readers who spent hours crafting their pearls of\
  \ wisdom to type them out again and repost them.\nIt is at times like this we all\
