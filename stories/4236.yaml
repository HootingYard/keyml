text: "\u201CDropping his studies in the realms of proverbial philosophy, that amiable\
  \ mid-Victorian butt, Martin Tupper, toyed for a time with spiritualism. He attended\
  \ one of Mrs Hall's s\xE9ances, when, with Home as the medium, the company included\
  \ \u2018a countess, the widow of a colonel, and a naval lieutenant\u2019. As a preliminary,\
  \ they were instructed to \u2018kneel down and offer up a prayer\u2019. This appears\
  \ to have been effective, since the table rose from the floor, raps resounded by\
  \ the dozen, and Home pulled red-hot coals out of the fire with his fingers. Although\
  \ he had braved battle and the breeze often enough, such a spectacle was apparently\
  \ too much for the representative of the senior service. \u2018It quite altered\
  \ his career\u2019, says Tupper, \u2018and, soon afterwards, he took Holy Orders\u2019\
