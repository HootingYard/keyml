  \ happy to learn that the latest episode of the Drabblecast is a \u201Cdouble-header\u201D\
  \ featuring two tales from Hooting Yard. The show includes Pabstus Tack and The\
  \ Breadcrumbs Man. It is worth pointing out that, when it came to recording a muffled\
  \ ghostly contribution at the end of a telephone line, I was under the impression\
  \ that Norm would be reading The Return Of Pabstus Tack, so that is the story I\
  \ was talking about. Apparently that piece will now appear in a future edition.\n\
  Hie thee yon to go and listen, after which you may wish to add your observations\
  \ to the Drabblecast Forum.\n\n[2013-05-02]"
