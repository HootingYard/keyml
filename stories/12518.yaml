text: "There is a story in today's Grauniad about young Polish artists being recruited\
  \ to recreate Vincent Van Gogh's paintings for a film. Young British artists, apparently,\
  \ lack the skills for the work because all they are \u201Ctaught\u201D (if that\
  \ is the word) at art school is how to make conceptual art. That would certainly\
  \ explain the unbelievably tiresome twaddle exuded by the Hoxtonwankers.\nA professor\
  \ at the Royal College of Art insists \u201Cthere are some very fine painters, but\
  \ the focus is on innovation and finding a new way of painting\u201D. Well, fine,\
  \ but it might help if students learned some \u201Cold\u201D ways of painting first.\
  \ Minor things like how to hold a brush and how to apply paint to canvas\u2014that\
  \ would be a start.\nBut that is by the by, because what really got my attention\
  \ was the final paragraph of the story, referring to the film.\nLoving Vincent will\
  \ question whether Van Gogh's death was suicide or murder. [Co-producer] Welchman\
  \ points to a Frenchman's \u201Coblique\u201D admission that he shot the artist\
  \ and that police have never found a weapon.\nThe inference of that last phrase\
  \ is surely that the French police are still investigating. If it said \u201Cpolice\
  \ never found a weapon\u201D, that would consign it firmly to the past. The inclusion\
  \ of \u201Chave\u201D suggests a live, ongoing enquiry. The thought of various gendarmes\
  \ scrabbling around Auvers-sur-Oise and environs searching desperately for a revolver\
  \ undiscovered for a century and a quarter is most enticing, and could provide the\
  \ basis for a police procedural crime thriller, though it might be fairly low on\
  \ thrills.\n\nAuthentic photo of Vincent Van Gogh from the Auvers-sur-Oise Gendarmerie\
