text: "Last time I bumped into a ragged-trousered philanthropist in the street, I\
  \ berated him for his dishevelment. Would it not be meet, I suggested, were he to\
  \ pay more attention to his toilet? I held before his eyes the image of Beau Brummell,\
  \ as an exemplar of attention to detail in masculine dress. Do you think for one\
  \ minute, I keened, that Brummell would ever have stepped out of doors wearing ragged\
  \ trousers?\nBut Brummell was not a philanthropist, countered the ragged-trousered\
  \ philanthropist, and he pressed a coin into my palm. I realised he had mistaken\
  \ me for a mendicant. It is true that my own apparel was somewhat raggedy, but I\
  \ can admire Beau Brummell without attempting to emulate him.\nHere, have your coinage\
  \ back, I said, I have no need of it.\nUngrateful swine!, shouted the philanthropist,\
  \ and he slapped my face. The slap was done with his bare hand. Had it been a glove,\
  \ I would have taken it as a challenge to engage in a duel. As he refused to take\
  \ back his coin, I tossed it into the gutter.\nLet a guttersnipe profit from your\
  \ philanthropy, I said, rubbing my cheek, and away I pranced, in the bitter sunshine.\n\
  At the corner, I paused, and turned, and waited until the ragged-trousered philanthropist\
  \ was out of sight. Then I hastened back to retrieve the coin from the gutter. Before\
  \ I could do so, however, an eagle-eyed guttersnipe, attracted by its silvery glint,\
  \ appeared from nowhere and scooped it up.\nI brandished my stick and beat the urchin\
  \ insensible. I prised the coin from his grasp and then rifled through his filthy\
  \ pockets to find what treasures lay therein. String, elastic bands, paper clips,\
  \ a boiled sweet, but no more coinage. I left the guttersnipe, battered and bloody,\
  \ in the gutter, and went on my way, in the bitter sunshine.\nExercise\_: The narrator\
  \ is clearly wallowing in a moral sewer. Describe this sewer, as vividly as you\
  \ are able, and populate it with other figures, both historical and fictional, who\
  \ you think are likely to be found there.\n[2013-06-20]"
