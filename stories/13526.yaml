text: 'Cracks began to appear in his story immediately. So rapid was their onset that
  the story itself had not even started, as I have just demonstrated. Not only that,
  but the story was full of holes. There were more holes than there was story, at
  this stage. If one examined it, the story did not hang together. But it was exceedingly
  difficult to examine it in any detail, because of the cracks and the holes. These
  were now so legion that the story itself was barely perceptible. It would be more
  accurate to say that it was not perceptible at all, by any of the senses, even if
  all five were in working order. It is, I suppose, vaguely possible, but only vaguely,
  that someone blessed with a sixth sense might be able to perceive the story, but
  oh, dimly, dimly. There were just far too many cracks, and far too many holes, and
  it simply did not hang together. How could you hang a hole, after all, or a crack,
  even separately, one by one, discrete, let alone all together? It would be a very
  peculiar nail from which you might hang such a vacancy, or multiplicity of vacancies,
  if you were minded to try a nail, rather than a hook or a paperclip. But let us
  assume, for the sake of argument, and for the sake of his immortal soul, that such
  a nail or hook or paperclip existed, and from it you were able to hang, after much
  effort and sweat and elbow grease, numberless holes and cracks uncountable. Would
  you then be any closer to an appreciation of his story? I would aver that you would
  not, You would be exhausted and still wallowing in ignorance. As it happens, Exhaustion
  and Ignorance are my middle names. So I need not bother my little head about his
  stupid story. I can merely collapse, panting, upon my pallet, in a state of bliss.
