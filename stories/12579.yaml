text: "The New Motive Power was constructed of copper, zinc and magnets, all carefully\
  \ machined, as well as a dining room table. At the end of nine months, Spear and\
  \ an unnamed woman, also referred to as \u201CMary of the New Dispensation\u201D\
  \ ritualistically birthed the contraption in an attempt to give it life. Unfortunately\
  \ for Spear, this failed to have the desired effect, and the machine was later dismantled.\n\
  The sort of paragraph that compels me to do further research. From John Murray Spear\
  \ & The Electric Messiah in today's Dabbler.\n[2014-03-29]"
