text: "We awake to discover the Great Wen matted with snow. The city is a white wasteland.\
  \ Buses and trains stand cold and neglected in their depots. By the day's end, if\
  \ the snow does not melt, or worse, if there are further falls, there is a real\
  \ risk of an epidemic of piblokto. Shivering in their hovels, the populace cries\
  \ out as one, \u201COh what shall we do? How can we cope with a world o\u2019 snow?\u201D\
  \nFar away, in Portland, Oregon, artist Hayley Barker has the answer. Back in December,\
  \ she wrote:\nSnow has hit Portland hard. It is causing some serious cabin fever.\
  \ The perfect antidote\u2014the Hooting Yard podcast. Frank Key's podcast of strange,\
  \ erudite, somehow Victorian short stories is certainly worth your time. This man\
  \ has created a rich fictional village full of bird-watching pamphleteers, troublesome\
  \ janitors, and more juicy language than you can fit in a pippy bag, which is a\
  \ phrase he uses often and one that I truly love. If you love alliteration, tongue-twisting\
  \ phrases, and antiquated language strung into run-on sentences, please download\
  \ his podcast, The Hooting Yard. I love Henry James\u2019 language, and Frank Key\
  \ is like a postmodern Henry James with a dry sense of humor and a small town perspective.\
  \ One of my favorite phrases is \u201Cgossamer fripperies,\u201D found in the story\
  \ Pitfalls On The Path To Sainthood. How can you not love it? I thank my husband\
  \ for finding him\u2026. Now go listen to a story about Dobson the pamphleteer.\
  \ Or better yet, buy one of the books. Let's keep this writer writing!\nMs Barker\
  \ is clearly a very sensible woman. You can see her art here. Meanwhile, take her\
  \ advice, batten down the hatches, and immerse yourself in Hooting Yard until the\
  \ snow disperses and tiny, fragile signs of life reappear in the white and silent\
  \ city.\n[2009-02-02]"
