text: "Following the success of his box-office hit American Snipe, about a killer\
  \ bird, Clint Eastwood has announced his next project. Rather excitingly for all\
  \ of us here at Hooting Yard, the octogenarian titan of cinema has bought the rights\
  \ to the Petula Clark Trilogy. My understanding is that, rather than making a series\
  \ of three films, Bourne-style, Mr Eastwood intends to compact the narrative into\
  \ a single movie, entitled American Snipper. As this title indicates, the film will\
  \ be a character study of the collector who originally snipped out of newspapers\
  \ the Petula Clark cuttings. Thanks to Max D\xE9charn\xE9, I am able to reproduce\
  \ one such cutting here. (Click to enlarge.)\n\n[2015-10-25]"
