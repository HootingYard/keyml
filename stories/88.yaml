text: "There is huge excitement at Bodger's Spinney as we look forward to this weekend's\
  \ annual Spinney Wreck Competition. Rival teams have been preparing for months,\
  \ in utmost secrecy, their re-enactments of The Wreck Of The Deutschland and The\
  \ Wreck Of The Hesperus. As ever when the Jesuits meet the Hiawathas, there is a\
  \ sense of age-old blood feud, and volunteer ambulance-based medicos wearing special\
  \ armbands will be on the alert from before daybreak.\nOld Farmer Frack's cows will\
  \ be mooching in a nearby field to add an air of bucolic charm, and Mrs Gubbins\
  \ will again be wearing the referee's chapeau. In an exclusive pre-contest interview\
  \ she told our reporter, \u201CI am hoping things pass off with due decorum, but\
  \ I have made sure we have enough tourniquets on site this year. No one wants to\
  \ see a repeat of the time we had to send urchins scampering off across the hills\
  \ to Old Ma Bagshaw's Bandage Shop.\u201D\nMrs Gubbins was made referee-in-perpetuity\
  \ after she single-handedly sent packing a gang of rogue Opium-Eaters who tried\
  \ to sabotage the contest with a wholly inappropriate, because shipless, re-enactment\
  \ of The Household Wreck.\nThe latest odds are available from the illegal gambling\
  \ den behind the illegal butcher's shop on the plaza.\n[2007-03-01]"
