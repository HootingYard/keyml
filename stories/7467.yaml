text: "Let me tell you how Hooting Yard prose comes to be written, and explain how\
  \ this is due to change.\nAs some of you will know, because I have bashed on about\
  \ it before, probably, the current practice is, and always has been, for me to enter\
  \ into a state of heightened consciousness and to wrench, manfully, from the very\
  \ inner core of the depths of my immortal soul, majestic sweeping paragraphs of\
  \ prose. It is tough and unrewarding work, and harrowing! harrowing!, but it is\
  \ both my duty and my destiny, as was writ in the stars, those glittering blobs\
  \ of impossibly distant burning rock spread out against the firmament.\nSuch spiritual\
  \ exertions take their toll, so I am pleased that in future the generation of Hooting\
  \ Yard prose will no longer be so harrowing!, harrowing! Why so?, you ask. Well,\
  \ thanks to Glyn Webster, Hooting Yard Research Fellow and janitor of The Pavilion\
  \ of Innocent Pastimes, I have had drawn to my attention the majestic Fifteen Thousand\
  \ Useful Phrases\_: A Practical Handbook Of Pertinent Expressions, Striking Similes,\
  \ Literary. Commercial, Conversational, And Oratorical Terms, For The Embellishment\
  \ Of Speech And Literature, And The Improvement Of The Vocabulary Of Those Persons\
  \ Who Read, Write. And Speak English by Grenville Kleiser, originally published\
  \ in 1917. Now, all I need do is pluck a selection of phrases, jam them together,\
  \ chuck in the occasional proper name or contextual setting, and foof-la!, entire\
  \ paragraphs of mighty prose are ready for your perusal and brain-numbing study.\n\
  You may recall that you have Mr Webster to thank for the conversion of the 2003\u2013\
  2006 Hooting Yard material into an indexed, fully searchable archive. In keeping\
  \ with his technowhizzery, he has created a machine-readable version of Grenville\
  \ Kleiser's invaluable resource,- the Phraseological Supercollider\u2014so one does\
  \ not even have to pick one's own crop from those fifteen thousand phrases. His\
  \ very first experiment delivered this passage:\nHappily for us, his face caught\
  \ the full strength of the rising wind. The pith and sinew of mature manhood, the\
  \ loud and urgent pageantry of the day, impalpable nothingness. I have acquired\
  \ some useful experience. Delude not yourselves with the belief, awed devotion,\
  \ sombre relations. I very rarely allow myself that pleasure.\nShove in a \u201C\
  Dobson\u201D or a \u201Cfictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u201D or an \u201Cin Pointy\
  \ Town\u201D, and you're laughing.\nFurther tweaks to what I think we should call\
  \ the Webster-Kleiser Phraseological Supercollider will enable us to, for example,\
  \ randomly recombine the adjective-noun pairs of Kleiser's \u201CUseful Phrases\u201D\
  . Again, the initial test of this module came up with extremely helpful \u201Cnew\u201D\
  \ useful phrases such as \u201Cinterpretative farce\u201D, \u201Cnoonday plundering\u201D\
  \ and \u201Crestricted cudgelling\u201D.\nIt occurs to me that, having revealed\
  \ to you the existence of Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases, I could leave you to\
  \ get on with it, creating your very own majestic sweeping paragraphs, while I retire\
  \ to a dilapidated seaside resort, there to suck on an ice lolly and be buffeted\
  \ by squalls. We shall see.\n[2011-10-24]"
