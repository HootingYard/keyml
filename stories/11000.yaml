text: 'So, having previously explained why I should have been the next Archbishop
  of Canterbury and why I was the obvious choice to be the next Director General of
  the BBC, I will no doubt be asked to explain why I should be the next Pope. Do I
  really need to argue my case? Has the world collapsed to the extent that it is even
  necessary for me to stake my claim? I mean, isn''t it blindingly obvious that I
  would be absolutely the finest Pontiff you could imagine? I shall sit by my metal
  tapping machine and await the call from the conclave of cardinals, and while I wait
  I shall give due consideration to the pontifical name I shall adopt. Readers may
  have their own suggestions of course, which you may wish to note in the comments.

  Meanwhile, it appears that these very sensible persons of the Islamic persuasion
  were correct after all. . .
