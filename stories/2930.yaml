text: 'Importantly, here are two pigs aboard a concrete boat moored in the mud at
  Burnham-on-Crouch. Readers will recall the town as one where Daniel Defoe reported
  the existence of fogwives. He had nothing to say of pigs and concrete boats, but
  it is unlikely, given the sunlight, that we are looking at mistpigs. Note the heavy
  chain tethering the concrete boat to the mud, to ensure it does not drift off into
  the River Crouch and cause maritime havoc.
