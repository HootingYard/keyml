text: "\u201CHow now, Holofernes,\u201D said Judith.\nHolofernes put down his sack\
  \ of grubbings on the floor and leaned to kiss the back of Judith's hand.\n\u201C\
  Your moustache is very bristly, Holofernes,\u201D said Judith, \u201CI fear it has\
  \ raised tiny scratches on my hand.\u201D\n\u201CPlunge it into a tub of ointment\
  \ and it will be as right as rain, woman!\u201D shouted Holofernes. Holofernes always\
  \ shouted, he was that kind of general.\n\u201COh, never mind, Holofernes, I am\
  \ fond of your moustache. It suits you. It is, how shall I say, decisive,\u201D\
  \ said Judith.\nHolofernes picked up his sack of grubbings again. He was blushing\
  \ slightly.\n\u201CI must take this sack of grubbings to my encampment, woman!\u201D\
  \ he shouted, \u201CIt will not do for me to dilly dally with a widow woman such\
  \ as yourself.\u201D\n\u201CWhat a pity, Holofernes,\u201D said Judith, \u201CI\
  \ have just borrowed some interesting pamphlets by Dobson from the mobile library,\
  \ and I thought you might like to join me in browsing through them. We could go\
  \ and sit upon a municipal park bench, and take a picnic with us. I have some radishes\
  \ and coleslaw and a jug of potato pulp diluted with rainwater.\u201D\nHolofernes\
  \ was a sucker for pamphlets, particularly ones written by Dobson, and he needed\
  \ little persuading to join Judith in the municipal park. The clouds were louring,\
  \ however.\n\u201CSee here, woman!\u201D he shouted, after swallowing a mouthful\
  \ of coleslaw, \u201CIf it begins to rain these pamphlets will get soaking wet and\
  \ when you return them to the library on or before the due date there may be ructions!\u201D\
  \n\u201CI am sure you know a thing or two about ructions, Holofernes,\u201D said\
  \ Judith coquettishly, \u201CBut don't worry, I have a tarpaulin here in my pippy\
  \ bag and in the event of a downpour I can take it out and unfold it and place the\
  \ pamphlets underneath it. Here, have another radish.\u201D\nHolofernes furrowed\
  \ his massive forehead, as if deep in thought, but then seemed to relax and, taking\
  \ the proffered radish, popped it into his mouth and crunched it. Judith caught\
  \ a glimpse of his teeth.\n\u201CHave you had a recent dental checkup, Holofernes?\u201D\
  \ she asked.\n\u201CThat, woman, is between me and my dentist! It is unseemly for\
  \ a widow woman from Bethulia to pry into such matters,\u201D shouted Holofernes.\n\
  \u201CForgive me, Holofernes,\u201D said Judith, \u201CI was forgetting my manners\
  \ there for a moment. But I was a little concerned that you may need an appointment\
  \ with the hygienist, for I clearly saw scraps of raw meat and carrots and cake-crumbs\
  \ stuck between your teeth. You have not been flossing, have you?\u201D\nHolofernes\u2019\
  \ temper flared. He stood up, picked up his sack of grubbings, and was about to\
  \ stomp off out of the municipal park when there was a cloudburst and the rain began\
  \ teeming down.\n\u201CQuick, Holofernes, help me to unfold the tarpaulin!\u201D\
  \ said Judith.\nTwo minutes later the Dobson pamphlets were safely covered up but\
  \ both Judith and Holofernes were sopping wet.\n\u201CWhen the rain stops we ought\
  \ to find a little boatman's hut in which to dry off and get a nice cup of tea,\u201D\
  \ said Judith, \u201CJust like Laura and Alec do in Brief Encounter after he falls\
  \ into the boating lake. Come to think of it,\u201D she added, \u201CYou remind\
  \ me of Alec's friend Dr Stephen Lynn, played by Valentine Dyall, except that Stephen\
  \ didn't have a decisive moustache and he was a bit of a prig. And you're not a\
  \ prig, are you, Holofernes?\u201D\n\u201CI am a general in Nebuchadnezzar's mighty\
  \ army, woman!\u201D shouted Holofernes, \u201CAnd that is all you need to know!\u201D\
  \n\u201COh, you're such a grumpy general, Holofernes,\u201D said Judith, \u201C\
  You know what I think would be good for you? Some aromatherapy. But you strike me\
  \ as more of a sweat lodge kind of chap.\u201D\n\u201CEnough, woman!\u201D shouted\
  \ Holofernes, \u201CYou may seek out an humble boatman's hut if you wish, but I\
  \ must return to my encampment with my sack of grubbings. I shall dry off in my\
  \ tent, which is a tent fit for a general!\u201D\n\u201CWell, I shall come with\
  \ you,\u201D said Judith.\nHolofernes grumbled, but he was secretly delighted, for\
  \ there was something about this widow woman that intrigued him and inflamed his\
  \ passions. They set off across the plains together.\n\u201CTell me about Babylon,\
  \ Holofernes, where your king Nebuchadnezzar lives. I have heard it is full of Rastafarians\
  \ smoking ganja and moaning on and on, rhythmically of course, about their misery,\u201D\
  \ said Judith.\n\u201CAs a general in the army, woman, I pay no heed to such countercultural\
  \ doings,\u201D shouted Holofernes, \u201CI have enough on my plate keeping my troops\
  \ on their toes and smiting mine enemies with a big sword.\u201D\n\u201COoh,\u201D\
  \ said Judith, \u201CYou'll have to let me see that big sword when we get back to\
  \ your encampment, Holofernes.\u201D\nLater, of course, when they were in Holofernes\u2019\
  \ tent and he showed Judith his big sword, she used it to slice his head off. Then\
  \ she went back to Bethulia, carrying the head of Holofernes, and was received in\
  \ triumph by her people.\n[2008-12-19]"
