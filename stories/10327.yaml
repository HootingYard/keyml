text: "That unparalleled pamphleteer of the twentieth century, Dobson, was never shy\
  \ about bruiting abroad his talent.\n\u201CIt has occurred to me,\u201D he said\
  \ one morning, over breakfast, to his inamorata, \u201CThat I am probably the greatest\
  \ writer since Homer. No, strike that \u2018probably\u2019. Really, there is no\
  \ question about it.\u201D\nMarigold Chew dallied with a sausage skewered on her\
  \ fork, and said, \u201CThat may be so, Dobson, but where in your accumulated pamphleteering\
  \ work is there a passage to match the catalogue of ships given by Homer in Book\
  \ Two of the Iliad?\u201D\n\u201CWhat catalogue of ships would that be?\u201D asked\
  \ Dobson, who had never actually read Homer.\nMarigold Chew leaned over to the bookcase,\
  \ took from it a copy of the Iliad in the translation by Samuel Butler, and tossed\
  \ it over to Dobson.\n\u201CRead and learn,\u201D she said, \u201CRead and learn.\u201D\
  \nAfter breakfast, Dobson did so.\nI will tell the captains of the ships and all\
  \ the fleet together, he read, Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius\
  \ were captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky\
  \ Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia,\
  \ Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae;\
  \ and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon;\
  \ Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus;\
  \ Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous\
  \ grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon\
  \ the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and\
  \ twenty young men of the Boeotians.\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led\
  \ the people that dwelt in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche\
  \ a noble maiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone\
  \ with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With these\
  \ there came thirty ships.\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons\
  \ of mighty Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus, rocky\
  \ Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea and\
  \ Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea by the springs\
  \ of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came forty ships, and they marshalled\
  \ the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their\
  \ left.\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so great,\
  \ nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little man, and his\
  \ breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes\
  \ and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair\
  \ Augeae, Tarphe, and Thronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty\
  \ ships of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.\nOn and on it went, captain after\
  \ captain, ship after ship, until Dobson calculated he had tallied up almost fifty\
  \ captains and over a thousand ships. Then he returned the book to its place, pulled\
  \ on his Bavarian Otter Hunter's boots, and headed for the door.\n\u201CWhere are\
  \ you going?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\u201CI intend to take the bus to the ill-starred\
  \ fishing village of O'Houlihan's Wharf,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CWhere I shall\
  \ sit on the jetty armed with propelling pencil and paper, making notes.\u201D\n\
  \u201CRighty-ho,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CWhat time can I expect you back?\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhen I have tallied up over fifty captains and at least one and a half thousand\
  \ ships,\u201D said Dobson, and he stamped out into the rain, slamming the door\
  \ behind him.\nLater, sitting on the jetty at O'Houlihan's Wharf armed with propelling\
  \ pencil and paper, the pamphleteer gazed upon the sloshing estuary. He had been\
  \ here all day, and thus far had a tally of three captains, one of whom he suspected\
  \ was a pantry boy in disguise, four fishing smacks, a tugboat, and a couple of\
  \ rowing boats. It was still raining, and he caught the bus home in a foul temper.\n\
  \u201CHow did you get on?\u201D asked Marigold Chew brightly.\n\u201CDon't ask,\u201D\
  \ growled Dobson, \u201CI am repairing to my escritoire and will join you later,\
  \ when I have written up my catalogue of ships.\u201D\nI will tell the captains\
  \ of the ships and all the fleet together, he wrote, as spotted from the jetty in\
  \ the ill-starred fishing village of O'Houlihan's Wharf on a wet Wednesday in October.\
  \ First let it be said that I do not know how long Homer sat in some similar seaside\
  \ spot counting captains and ships. But my own experience leads me to distrust his\
  \ tally, and I think he was probably cheating, making things up, inventing captains\
  \ and ships out of whole cloth. Well, two can play at that game.\nI counted fifty-five\
  \ captains, Bristow, Snippy, Vile, Glinka, Dipdap, Penge, Crowbar, Hoistermann,\
  \ Buckle, Snedbury, Frowst, Pang, Gleet, Owlhead, the further names to be added\
  \ later.\nAnd I counted two thousand ships, including fishing smacks and tugboats\
  \ and rowing boats, and I will list all their names after I have had a bite to eat.\n\
  This will become known as Dobson's Catalogue Of Ships, and with the passage of time,\
  \ several centuries\u2019 worth, nobody will dare to doubt its veracity. Long after\
  \ Homer is forgotten, and his captains and ships all blotted out, the name of Dobson\
  \ will resound down the ages. Wherever two or three nautically-enthusiastic persons\
  \ are gathered together, and feel impelled to recite lengthy lists of captains and\
  \ ships, it is my catalogue they will turn to, and read aloud, declaiming the mighty\
  \ names in mighty voices! But first, on this wet Wednesday evening, I shall partake\
  \ of soup and sausages, and a cup of tea.\n[2012-10-09]"
