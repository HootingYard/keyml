text: "The appointment of Brian Eno (aged 59) as the Liberal Democrats\u2019 adviser\
  \ to help new leader Nick Clegg (aged 40) keep in touch with Britain's youth has\
  \ caused much hilarity in blogland. I particularly liked this post which reminds\
  \ us of some of Brian's more enticing plans and projects. Yet I fear people are\
  \ too quick to ridicule what is obviously a piece of visionary brilliance. Just\
  \ imagine the transformation in the packs of brainless hoodies and gun-toting pre-pubescent\
  \ inner city \u201Cgangstas\u201D if, instead of being issued with Asbos, they are\
  \ given a stiff dose of Oblique Strategies, innit?\n[2007-12-31]"
