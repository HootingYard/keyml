text: "There is an old joke, a proper chestnut, which begins \u201CA mod and a rocker\
  \ and a widow and an orphan walk into a bar\u2026\u201D The Oxford English Dictionary\
  \ does not tell us why we use the word chestnut in this context. It says that the\
  \ usage \u201Cprobably\u201D originated in the United States and, curiously, that\
  \ \u201Cthe newspapers of 1886\u20137 contain numerous circumstantial explanations\
  \ palpably invented for the purpose\u201D. What was in the air in those two years\
  \ that suddenly made this a debatable issue? Perhaps there was a spate of chestnut\
  \ madness, similar to the carrot madness that ran rife in Belgium and northern France\
  \ in the 1850s. No convincing explanation has ever been given for the latter episode,\
  \ and it happened too late to be addressed by Charles Mackay in Extraordinary Popular\
  \ Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (1841).\nThe bar into which the mod and the\
  \ rocker and the widow and the orphan walk in the joke is usually specified to be\
  \ a seafront bar, no doubt on account of the infamous seaside resort pitched battles\
  \ between mods and rockers\u2014though not between widows and orphans\u2014in the\
  \ mid-1960s. Interestingly, however, in one persistently popular variant of the\
  \ gag, the punchline depends heavily on the bar being the drinking den known as\
  \ the Tip Top Annexe, a rather seedy establishment on the Crescent in Aden, when\
  \ it was Prince of Wales Crescent in the British Protectorate of Aden. This was\
  \ close to the Grand Hotel De L'Univers, where Arthur Rimbaud fetched up on his\
  \ arrival in Aden in August 1880. There is an echo of Rimbaud in some versions of\
  \ the joke, when the rocker, or sometimes the widow, is said to have \u201Cdried\
  \ [him- or herself] in the air of crime\u201D. The joke works well enough with or\
  \ without this observation, as indeed it does when it is not set in the Tip Top\
  \ Annexe, so long as the punchline is modified accordingly.\nIn his study Draining\
  \ The Last Vestiges Of Humour Out Of The Funniest Gags, the pop psychologist Dr\
  \ Desmond Drain frets away, like a dog with a bone, at the idea that the mod and\
  \ the rocker and the widow and the orphan are not, as we would assume, four persons,\
  \ but two. In this reading, the mod is the widow and the rocker is the orphan. He\
  \ goes on to posit, in further garbled analytical posturing, that they are a couple\
  \ in love, smitten with each other, who, before entering the bar\u2014which may\
  \ or may not be the Tip Top Annexe\u2014have had a tiff, because of a crime committed,\
  \ either by the mod/widow or the rocker/orphan, where one sides with, or personifies,\
  \ law and order, and the other represents the forces of crime, disorder, and even,\
  \ at a pinch, existential chaos. Dr Drain's own preconceptions and prejudices regarding\
  \ the values inherent in the different types of music championed by mods and rockers\
  \ tend to colour his argument, as does the fact that he was orphaned at an early\
  \ age, when his parents died in the riots which occurred during the outbreak of\
  \ citrus fruit madness in south coast seaside resorts in the 1970s. Whether or not\
  \ one gives credence to his interpretation, most people agree that the joke works\
  \ better with four protagonists rather than two.\nOr rather, with five protagonists,\
  \ for let us not forget that essential addendum, the barman who serves their drinks.\
  \ Tip Top Annexe types like to have him wearing either a fez or a pith helmet, but\
  \ any sort of headgear serves equally well. He does have to wear something on his\
  \ head, however, simply to be able to incorporate into the joke the part where he\
  \ takes it off and places it on the bar counter. As an experiment, I once told the\
  \ joke without including this detail and, as expected, it fell completely flat.\
  \ In fact, some among my audience were so miffed, in spite of being fully aware\
  \ they had been assembled for the specific purpose of experimental joke-telling\
  \ research, that they stooped to pick up pebbles and shingle from the beach and\
  \ pelted me with them, until I had to make a run for it to the safety of the railway\
  \ station. At least it was pebbles rather than shivs, otherwise it would have been\
  \ like a scene from Brighton Rock. It was probably not a good idea to conduct my\
  \ research at the seaside.\nIn some variants of the joke, though intriguingly not\
  \ always those which insist upon the Tip Top Annexe setting in Aden, the barman's\
  \ appearance is given, and he closely resembles Arthur Rimbaud. We are told he has\
  \ \u201Cthe perfectly oval face of an angel in exile\u201D (Verlaine), and is \u201C\
  sympathique\u2026 speaks little, and accompanies his brief comments with odd little\
  \ cutting gestures with his right hand\u201D (Bardey). It is with one of these cutting\
  \ gestures that the barman accidentally knocks over the absinthe ordered by the\
  \ mod\u2014or sometimes by the rocker\u2014leading directly to what today's barbarians\
  \ might call the \u201CLOL moment, innit\u201D midway through the joke, a particularly\
  \ clever insertion as it is often taken as the punchline. That the joke then continues\
  \ only serves to heighten the uproarious hilarity of its side-splitting conclusion.\
  \ Where the odd little cutting gestures by the barman are absent, the glass of absinthe,\
  \ or lemonade or vapido ague, is knocked over by another agency, which might be\
  \ a gust of wind, a stray dog, or an invisible sprite.\nIt is the venerability of\
  \ the joke, its status as an old chestnut\u2014not a carrot nor a piece of citrus\
  \ fruit\u2014which has led, in years of telling and retelling, to so many variations.\
  \ Their profusion has persuaded some that an effort ought to be made to recover\
  \ the Ur-joke, stripped of all inessentials. One such attempt, attributed to the\
  \ japester Fat Billy Cannonball, which has gone down a storm at certain northern\
  \ seaside resorts, dispenses with the mod and the rocker and the widow and the orphan,\
  \ and has Arthur Rimbaud himself, walking into the bar of the Grand Hotel De L'Univers\
  \ on Prince of Wales Crescent in the British Protectorate of Aden on a specific\
  \ day in August 1880, and ordering an absinthe, or \u201Cthis sage-bush of the glaciers\u201D\
  , as he puts it. I have yet to hear this version in its entirety, but I have already\
  \ been rendered helpless with mirth, and must roll about on the floor, convulsed,\
  \ as if in the throes of a fit. Excuse me while I do just that.\n\n[2012-03-07]"
