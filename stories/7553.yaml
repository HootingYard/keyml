text: "Compare and contrast these two snaps. One shows a trio of carvings from an\
  \ \u201CIndian cemetery\u201D (reportedly), taken in 1900. The second shows a trio\
  \ of Channel 4 newsreaders performing a musical number at a charity event (reportedly),\
  \ taken last week.\n\n\nDullwits and dunderpates would say \u201CWell, Mr Key, so\
  \ what? The only thing the two photographs have in common is that they show three\
  \ figures. You could find thousands, nay, millions of similar snaps. What point\
  \ are you trying to make?\u201D\nThe point I am trying to make is that this is the\
  \ first, albeit flimsy, evidence I have discovered of the cult surrounding bumptious\
  \ newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Oh, there are flaws in my reasoning, many, many\
  \ flaws. But I implore those of you who think I am talking twaddle to watch \u201C\
  KrishGM\u201D (as he likes to be known\u2026 why???) very, very carefully in the\
  \ coming months. The cult has something planned, I am sure of it.\n[Indian cemetery\
  \ snap from Dull Tool Dim Bulb. Cult offering from Channel 4 News.]\n[2011-11-09]"
