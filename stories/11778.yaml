text: "A snippet from Memoirs Of A Public Baby by Philip O'Connor:\nThe hut on the\
  \ hill was in a fairly detached part of a holiday camp, the most \u201Cselect\u201D\
  \ of several on this hill in Surrey. The signs of this selectiveness were the wide\
  \ spaces between the huts; their decorum in colour and lack of fantasy in architecture;\
  \ and the absence of radios (though the loudspeaker was still young), and the quality\
  \ and size of the cars arriving at week-ends; and the good-quality plus-fours of\
  \ the younger set. They were, in fact, of the class most disliked by my guardian,\
  \ mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers, whom he also didn't\
  \ like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp except a certain scoutmaster.\
  \ This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and I feel certain he came from Roehampton,\
  \ because of a particular greenhouse wildness in his appearance (I caught him acquiring\
  \ a tropical tan artfully behind a bush once). He liked to stand most erect on the\
  \ brow of the plateau and scan the horizon, eyes narrowed, ready, I believe, for\
  \ eventualities.\n[2013-07-21]"
