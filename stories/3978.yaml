text: "Could it be that the shade of Christopher Smart is haunting the corridors of\
  \ a large and important municipal building in far away Oregon? This unlikely question\
  \ is prompted by a discovery made by Brit over at Think Of England. In the course\
  \ of his valuable research into the Official State Crustaceans of the USA, Brit\
  \ unearthed House Joint Resolution 37 from the Oregon Legislative Assembly, adopted\
  \ in 2009.\nThere is nobody called Smart among the Representatives and Senators\
  \ who passed the Resolution, but it is clear to me that the mad poet's spirit hovered\
  \ over whomsoever drafted it. Granted, it uses \u201CWhereas\u201D rather than Christopher\
  \ Smart's favoured \u201CLet\u201Ds and \u201CFor\u201Ds in Jubilate Agno, but otherwise\
  \ this could be a lost fragment of that great poem:\nWhereas the Dungeness crab\
  \ fishery is the most valuable single-species fishery in Oregon, making Dungeness\
  \ crab an important part of Oregon's economy; and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab is\
  \ an iconic Oregon symbol; and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab is the most delicious\
  \ of the crab species; and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab annual harvest begins each\
  \ year on December 1, when Dungeness crabs are hard-shelled, full of meat and in\
  \ their prime; and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab harvest ends on August 14 to minimize\
  \ handling, so that post-molt, soft-shelled crabs can fill out undisturbed; and\n\
  Whereas this management method has served the resource well for decades and ensures\
  \ that the Dungeness crab fishery is truly sustainable; now, therefore,\nBe It Resolved\
  \ by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon:\nThat the Dungeness crab is\
  \ the official crustacean of the State of Oregon.\n[2010-02-24]"
