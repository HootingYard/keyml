text: "Yesterday I had a persistent earworm in the form of the Skye Boat Song. \u201C\
  Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing\u2026\u201D I have to say this was a\
  \ more welcome noise in my head than the usual one, which, as I explained a while\
  \ ago at The Dabbler, tends to be \u201CHappy Christmas (War Is Over)\u201D by John\
  \ Lennon and the woman Cornelius Cardew threw out of his house. With the Skye Boat\
  \ Song echoing through my brain all day, I was able to recall that, when I was an\
  \ infant, this tune made me well up in tears. I thought it was the most gorgeous\
  \ melody I had heard in all my six or seven years.\nBut where did I hear it? We\
  \ were not a musical family. There was an old bakelite radio in the house, with\
  \ frequencies for Hilversum and Luxembourg marked (among others), but I don't have\
  \ any clear memories of listening to it. We also had a Dansette record player, on\
  \ which my elder sisters span the latest waxing from the Liverpudlian moptops. Other\
  \ than that, I think the music I heard most often was the hymns we sang in church\
  \ every Sunday. Well, some sang, like my father, who had a tin ear but belted out\
  \ the hymns with misplaced enthusiasm. I just opened and closed my mouth at what\
  \ seemed like appropriate times.\nI must have heard the Skye Boat Song at infant\
  \ school. Whether it was a recording or was sung by one of my teachers I cannot\
  \ remember. What I do remember is that it was the first piece of music I had an\
  \ emotional response to. This was absolutely nothing to do with the words, all that\
  \ guff about Bonnie Prince Charlie escaping to Skye after his defeat at Culloden.\
  \ The travails of Scottish royals had no purchase on my heart. And the only words\
  \ I remember\u2014then as now\u2014are the opening lines as quoted above. It was\
  \ the tune that stirred me, and made me a tearful little infant.\nIt would have\
  \ been a couple of years later that, rummaging through my sisters\u2019 small collection\
  \ of 45 rpm singles, I came upon a couple of records that I played to death. Neither\
  \ of them made me weep, but I loved them nonetheless. One was \u201CCan't Buy Me\
  \ Love\u201D by the Liverpudlian moptops, the other \u201CLike A Rolling Stone\u201D\
  \ by Bob Dylan. Given my lifelong obsession with words, it's interesting that what\
  \ I adored about the latter was less the lyrics tumbling out of the singer in that\
  \ grating whine, but the sound of that band.\nA couple more years passed, and then\
  \ my elder brother began to bring LPs home. His first purchase was Abbey Road. Even\
  \ at that early age, I loathed \u201CMaxwell's Silver Hammer\u201D. I was not entirely\
  \ convinced by \u201COctopus's Garden\u201D either. Sorry, Ringo. The rest of it\
  \ I rather liked, but there was nothing there to make me weep. Now, years later,\
  \ I find I can get quite emotional listening to \u201CGolden Slumbers\u201D, but\
  \ not then. My brother's second LP was Stand Up by Jethro Tull, featuring the hairy\
  \ monopod flautist. Here I found something that almost, but not quite, prompted\
  \ the tears which I was beginning to suspect I sought from music. Clearly I have\
  \ deep reserves of mawkishness. The penultimate song on side two, \u201CReasons\
  \ For Waiting\u201D, tugged at my heartstrings. Listening to it now, I cannot imagine\
  \ why. I still harbour an extraordinary affection for the early Jethro Tull albums,\
  \ but if there is sobbing now it is generally prompted by laughter. As with Leonard\
  \ Cohen, there is a vein of humour in Ian Anderson too readily overlooked. Thick\
  \ As A Brick is one of the funniest records ever made\u2014and deliberately so,\
  \ I hasten to add.\nOne day when I was about fourteen I at last discovered music\
  \ that brought tears to my eyes, just as the Skye Boat Song had done. This was one\
  \ of the very few LPs in my father's scant collection, a recording of Paul Tortelier\
  \ and Jean Hubeau playing the Elegy and Two Sonatas by Gabriel Faur\xE9. I played\
  \ it over and over again for weeks on end, tears streaming down my face. That cello\
  \ will get you every time.\nBut then I was beset by teenpersonhood, and I fell hopelessly\
  \ in love with Henry Cow. A love that has survived, of course. But nobody ever accused\
  \ Tim Hodgkinson et al of mawkishness. I was by now at grammar school, where the\
  \ ungainly youths split into two musical camps. There were the spotty bespectacled\
  \ wannabe intellectuals, lapping up prog, and the poptastic kids dazzled by glam.\
  \ You will not need to be told which tribe I belonged to. Though I should say I\
  \ had a soft spot for Roxy Music, at least in the early two-Brians period, which\
  \ my sniffier pals abhorred.\nA few years later and punk happened. Young Mr Key\
  \ was a little slow on the uptake, it has to be said. Spitting pogoists were not\
  \ my cup of tea. But the John Peel show was, and one night I recall hearing the\
  \ Desperate Bicycles, and undergoing a Damascene conversion. I think I went so far\
  \ as to ban records made by men with beards from my turntable. (Fortunately, there\
  \ were no beards in Henry Cow. Preposterous sideburns, yes. Beards, no.) As punk\
  \ became post-punk, I became ever more enamoured. Younger readers may struggle to\
  \ believe that Scritti Politti were once the most brilliant group in the entire\
  \ universe, as I insisted at the time. That time was lamentably brief, and ended\
  \ with the release of \u201CThe \u2018Sweetest Girl\u2019\u201D in 1981, after which\
  \ everything recorded by Green (real name Paul Strohmeyer-Gartside) can be consigned\
  \ to a dustbin and buried in a lead-lined vault deep below the earth's surface.\n\
  But time passes, and we grow older, and we sift and sort and filter. And we find\
  \ ourselves once more wishing to hear music that makes us weep. As David Bowie asked\
  \ in \u201CYoung Americans\u201D, \u201CAin't there one damn song that can make\
  \ me break down and cry?\u201D Well, yes, there is, and in my case chief among them\
  \ would appear to be the Skye Boat Song. Make of that what you will.\n[2012-07-18]"
