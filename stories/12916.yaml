text: "Dear Mr Key, writes a correspondent I have just made up, I know you are a constant\
  \ reader who always has \u201Ca book on the go\u201D, as they say. It would interest\
  \ me to know how you go about choosing which book you are going to read next.\n\
  In the normal course of things, I would be hard put to give a straightforward answer\
  \ to that question. Like most of us, I suspect, I alight upon books for all manner\
  \ of different reasons, not always rational. Today, however, I can say definitively\
  \ that I decided on my current reading simply because I saw a photograph in the\
  \ newspaper of Michael Gove reading it.\nWhen he was sacked as Education Secretary\
  \ the other week, the Grauniad had a double-page spread on Gove, much of which was\
  \ of course devoted to attacking him. Among the accompanying photos was one of Gove\
  \ \u201Cat a literary festival\u201D, where he was shown reading from\u2014the title\
  \ was clearly visible\u2014The Lost World of British Communism by Raphael Samuel,\
  \ essays written in the 1980s but published in book form (by Verso) in 2006.\nI\
  \ immediately wanted to read this book, and eventually got round to borrowing it\
  \ from the library. Just a few pages in, and it looks very promising. In the preface\
  \ by Samuel's widow Alison Light, I learn that among the treats in store are such\
  \ details as\nwhat Communists sang or watched at the cinema; what they wore, (open-necked\
  \ shirts, if they were men, with a pen or pencil prominently displayed in the breast\
  \ pocket; jumper, slacks and \u2018sensible shoes\u2019 if they were women); how\
  \ Party members comported themselves in public (they were urged to be neat and clean);\
  \ where they went on holiday\u2014if indeed they took holidays\u2014preferring \u2018\
  bracing walks\u2019 in bleak settings; the content and feel of their homes, which\
  \ were usually uncomfortable, with a small shrine of books and the garden left a\
  \ wilderness, the author tells us, for want of \u2018personal time\u2019.\nI shall\
  \ report further snippets of interest as I read on. Meanwhile, if any readers are\
  \ able to provide further photographs of Michael Gove reading particular books,\
  \ I will be very grateful.\n[2014-08-02]"
