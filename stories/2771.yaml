  \ the vaguely ornithological resonance of its name. I am assured, however, that\
  \ it is increasingly the medium through which people keep abreast of that which\
  \ is critical to their leading a well-ordered life. And what could be more critical\
  \ than the doings at Hooting Yard? I have therefore arranged\u2014via the indefatigable\
  \ technoboffin\u2014for a \u201Ctweet\u201D to be generated whenever a new item\
  \ appears on this website, and whenever a new podcast becomes available from ResonanceFM.\
  \ I will most assuredly not be tapping idiotic drivel in to Twitter every five minutes.\n\
  If you wish to \u201Cfollow\u201D Hooting Yard, the stuff on Twitter appears at,\
  \ unsurprisingly, @hootingyard\nNOTE\_: I will also use Twitter to draw attention\
  \ to intriguing links, for example this one, about a cork-, gutta percha-, and linseed\
  \ oil-based floor covering called Kamptulicon.\n[2009-08-01]"
