text: "Mr Key wishes to announce that henceforth he will be following the Path of\
  \ Pollen. As you may already know, this Path is an important and ancient tradition\
  \ of bee shamanism. Like Naomi Lewis, I will be bounding out of bed at dawn and\
  \ doing the lemniscatic walk. It looks like walking in a figure of eight. When bees\
  \ come back from foraging, they do this to tell the hive where the best nectar is,\
  \ and so on. The walk is seen to give one access to infinite knowledge and vitality.\n\
  You might wonder what precisely is implied by that \u201Cand so on\u201D, as if\
  \ there is some kind of fluffy vagueness about the Path of Pollen, but I can assure\
  \ you this is not so. I am confident that, as infinite knowledge and vitality begin\
  \ to suffuse every last chink of Hooting Yard, you, as readers, will be thankful\
  \ that bee shamanism is being practised here, and you may indeed take up lemniscatic\
  \ walking yourselves.\nIncidentally, I have been asked a number of times over the\
  \ years if Joost Van Dongelbraacke, the suburban shaman, was in fact a suburban\
  \ bee shaman, but I am afraid my researches to date have thrown only a very pale\
  \ light on the matter. While some authorities claim that he shed bits of beeswax\
  \ as he roamed his shamanic suburb, others counter that they were simply bits of\
  \ earwax falling from his admittedly rather grubby head. I do not yet know enough\
  \ to pronounce on the question, for I have only been following the Path of Pollen\
  \ since this morning, and so my knowledge is not yet infinite. I am hoping it will\
  \ be so by about Thursday week.\n[2008-01-09]"
