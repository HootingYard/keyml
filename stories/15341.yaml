text: 'This afternoon I shall be undergoing what seems like the umpteenth injection
  of a needle directly into my eyeball. It occurs to me that at some point I ought
  to write an account of what goes on at Tuesday Injection Club, introducing you lot
  to some of the characters I encounter, the doctors, nurses, and ancillary staff
  and the other patients. I can also attempt to answer some of the burning questions
  that are raised, such as why do I never get offered a cup of tea? and who is that
  mad woman who marches to and fro brandishing a clipboard but never actually speaks
  to anyone?

  I shall be interested to discover if, this week, I experience the Black Spot. Sometimes,
  after an injection, I have a Black Spot in my eye for a day or two, and sometimes
  not. The first time this happened it was mightily disconcerting. Now I treat it
  with airy familiarity, and imagine it as something that might have inspired a tale
  by J Sheridan Le Fanu.

  My more devoted readers will no doubt be asking but Mr Key can you actually see
  any better? to which the answer is, no, not yet, I am still perceiving the world
  through a blur of hazy mist or a haze of misty blur.

  Onwards to jab time!
