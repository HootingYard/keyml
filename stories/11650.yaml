text: "It is high time I wrote something profound. To do so has always been within\
  \ my gift, of course, it is just that I have neglected it. Oh, every single day\
  \ I am beset by thoughts of great profundity, though admittedly these may oft be\
  \ mistaken for platitudes, truisms, or mad ravings.\nThis morning, for example,\
  \ as I awoke with the sunrise, at approximately half past four, the first thing\
  \ that came into my head was the phrase \u201CAll roads lead to Rome\u201D. How\
  \ profound that is. We could, if we wished, worry away at it for hours and hours,\
  \ like a cat with a strand of wool, and, unlike the cat, we would forever find new\
  \ insights, new angles, unfathomable depths of wisdom and, yes, profundity. The\
  \ cat, by contrast, being ineradicably stupid, would forget whatever it had learned\
  \ about the strand of wool thirty seconds ago. I am sometimes envious of cats. Imagine\
  \ how exciting life must be, to be so stupid!\nUnfortunately, with my pea-sized\
  \ yet pulsating brain, I am able to fret and fiddick about the five words \u201C\
  All roads lead to Rome\u201D for hour after hour. I can draw from them profound\
  \ insights about history and geography and the nature of what it means to be human,\
  \ and much else besides. I can become lost in profundity.\nBy the way, I made up\
  \ that word \u201Cfiddick\u201D. Or at least, I commandeered the surname of the\
  \ last editor of the much-lamented The Listener, Peter Fiddick, to serve as a verb\
  \ meaning something along the lines of fretting at and worrying at something, as\
  \ a cat might fret and worry at a strand of wool, as a fool might fret at an old\
  \ adage. But you knew what I meant, didn't you?\n[2013-06-22]"
