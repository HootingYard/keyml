  \ a rotting jetty beset by squalls. When one prances out along a pier or jetty,\
  \ there is always a distinct possibility of toppling over and plummeting in to the\
  \ sea. So I shall be going well-prepared, with my 1869-vintage life-saving suit,\
  \ complete with Eureka! companion buoy kitted out with water, food, reading material\
  \ (so that I may read the news to pass the time of day), cigars, a pipe and tobacco,\
  \ plus torches.\n\nFrom Ptak Science Books,\_with thanks to peacay for drawing it\
