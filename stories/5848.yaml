text: "Forty years ago, David Bowie demanded \u201CLay me place and bake me pie!\u201D\
  , not unreasonably in the circumstances, as he added, \u201CI'm starving for me\
  \ gravy!\u201D We have all, I think, been there, as they say nowadays. I have certainly\
  \ had gravy hankerings of my own, most recently this very morning. Oddly enough,\
  \ the first stirrings of a gravy craving stole upon me shortly after I had finished\
  \ my breakfast of eggy cornflakes and smokers\u2019 poptarts. I left the house to\
  \ take a turn around the duckpond over by the viaduct, and there came a constriction\
  \ in my throat, a throbbing in the head, and a pang in the belly. Gravy, I thought,\
  \ I'm starving for me gravy. I was unlikely to find any by the duckpond, so I wheeled\
  \ about and set off in the opposite direction, towards the parade of shops.\nPast\
  \ the hatter's and the haberdasher's and the ironmonger's there is a pie shop. To\
  \ my dismay, I saw that its shutters were down, and there was no aroma of baking.\
  \ I hammered my fists upon the shutters and screeched the words of David Bowie quoted\
  \ above. Clearly gravy starvation was playing havoc with my common sense, for as\
  \ I well knew, the pie shop did not have an in-store dining facility, so even had\
  \ it been open I could not sensibly have demanded that my place be laid. I made\
  \ such a din that the ironmonger came out of his shop, next door, to see what was\
  \ afoot. He was armed with a sample of his ironmongery, a wrench or a crowbar, and\
  \ who can blame him? I was hardly the picture of an upstanding citizen, in my gravy-famished\
  \ hysteria. He dealt me a hefty thump on my cranium and used harsh words. Sprawled\
  \ on the paving slabs, I gasped an apology for causing such a racket. I was about\
  \ to explain that I was starving for me gravy when the ironmonger recognised me.\n\
  \u201CGood grief, Stipendiary Landgrave Pursuivant to the County Infanta, it is\
  \ you!\u201D he cried, and immediately proceeded to mumble his own, fawning, apology,\
  \ helping me to my feet and dusting me down as he did so.\n\u201CUnhand me, tradesperson!\u201D\
  \ I barked, \u201CJust tell me why the pie shop is shut when I am in need of me\
  \ gravy!\u201D\nBy such direct questioning did I learn that the pie shop proprietor\
  \ had taken leave of absence to attend an important festival in a neighbouring land.\
  \ He had left at dawn, apparently, in a cabriolet, both his face and that of his\
  \ horse daubed with cosmetics in the guise of Aladdin Sane. I had forgotten all\
  \ about the Bowiethon.\nWith well-practised aristocratic disdain, I tossed a coin\
  \ to the ironmonger and told him to return to his shop. Then I continued along the\
  \ parade towards Old Mrs Sniggleby's Dickensian Dining Parlour, a place of grease\
  \ and spoons, only to discover that she too had left town, and for the same reason,\
  \ though the urchin begging outside her door told me she was an aficionado of the\
  \ Berlin trilogy, and had gone to the festival under Japanese influence, in a kimono,\
  \ clutching her set of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies cards. I needed an oblique\
  \ strategy of my own if I was going to get me gravy!\nI decided to pop along to\
  \ the palace, to call on the County Infanta. After all, I was her Stipendiary Landgrave\
  \ Pursuivant, so I was always welcome. She was a tiny little thing, being an infanta,\
  \ and I suspected she had not yet graduated to solid foods. That being the case,\
  \ there might well be some gravy available. I bustled past the Serjeant-At-Arms\
  \ and made straight for the palace kitchen. I did not expect to see the Infanta\
  \ herself in these lowly skivvy's quarters, but there she was, gurgling away, sitting\
  \ in a tin can.\n\u201CI am about to feed Her Infantaness her elevenses,\u201D said\
  \ the cook, \u201CWould you like some?\u201D\nI was appalled by the cook's \_overfamiliar\
  \ tone, but so gravy-deranged that I let it pass.\n\u201CI will if she's having\
  \ gravy!\u201D I cried,\n\u201CNo, when she's sitting in her tin can I make her\
  \ swallow a couple of protein pills,\u201D said the cook.\nDammit. I could have\
  \ tried pulling rank, but I was fraught and weary. I wolfed down some protein pills,\
  \ reached over to the sideboard for a helmet, put the helmet on, and climbed in\
  \ to the tin can next to the Infanta. Soon, thanks to the palace's winch and pulley\
  \ apparatus, we would be floating, far above the moon. There is no gravy on the\
  \ moon.\n[2011-01-12]"
