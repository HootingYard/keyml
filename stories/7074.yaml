text: "When I was telling you how to make a life-size wolf out of marzipan, I pointed\
  \ out that it made a splendid teatime treat for both one's extended family and for\
  \ smaller kinship grouplets. This prompted a letter from Miss Dimity Cashew, who\
  \ chided me for excluding those poor lonely souls who have neither. Curiously, she\
  \ picked as an example the Grunty Man, that monster of children's nightmares who\
  \ lurks alone in his horrible cave, without a Mrs Grunty or anyone else to share\
  \ his grunty depravities and/or delights. I say \u201Ccuriously\u201D, because quite\
  \ why one would want to present the Grunty Man with a marzipan wolf, or with any\
  \ other kind of gift, unless it be an offering to assuage his grunty depredations,\
  \ is a moot point.\nAnyway, I tossed Miss Cashew's letter into my bakelite \u201C\
  pending\u201D hub and thought no more about it. But now, correspondence from a different\
  \ correspondent raises the issue of whether in fact the Grunty Man does have some\
  \ kind of family ties.\nDear Mr. Key, writes Tabitha Brown, I am writing to you\
  \ concerning two legendary bogeypersons, first the Grunty Man, and second Mrs Grundy,\
  \ about whom Emily Post wrote in her Blue Book of Social Usage, at least in the\
  \ earlier editions (as the more recent incarnations of the manual regrettably make\
  \ no mention of her). Apart from having similar names and delighting in the destruction\
  \ of the young, are these two characters related in any way? I eagerly await your\
  \ response, which I hope will prove to be edifying. Thank you for your consideration\
  \ upon this matter.\nMs Brown helpfully enclosed some snapshots, which I reproduce\
  \ below, and which can be enlarged to gigantic proportions by clicking on them.\n\
  \n\nI have not yet been able to do all the research necessary to provide a definitive\
  \ answer to the question. However, the fact that Emily Post's Mrs Grundy has a pet\
  \ magpie and a pet jackal is telling. The Grunty Man, too, is known to keep pets,\
  \ among which may or may not be a magpie and a jackal. Nobody has ever dared enter\
  \ his horrible cave to carry out an inventory of such beasts as he keeps as pets,\
  \ and he rarely allows them out of the foetid gloom. Clearly there is more work\
  \ to be done on this important subject. In the meantime, it seems that Miss Dimity\
  \ Cashew can put her mind at rest, albeit tentatively, regarding the Grunty Man's\
  \ possession of kith and kin.\n[2011-08-04]"
