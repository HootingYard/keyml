text: "\nWhen, recently, it was announced that the Nobel Prize for Literature had\
  \ been awarded to Kazuo Ishiguro, I thought I ought to read one of his books. Leaning\
  \ out of the window, I hailed a passing urchin and sent him scampering off to what\
  \ passes for a lending library in my bailiwick. Now this young wastrel was either\
  \ inattentive or hard of hearing, for when he returned, several hours later, he\
  \ brought, not The Redundancy Of Courage but The Consistency Of Porridge, a book\
  \ by the noted food writer Rex Foodwrite.\nExasperated, I smacked the urchin on\
  \ the head, but I took the book anyway and sat down to read it. And what a revelation!\
  \ Foodwrite gives a day-by-day account, in exhaustive detail, of the consistency\
  \ of his breakfast porridge over a two-day period. His prose is at once Miltonic\
  \ and Kafkaesque, Beckettian and Poeish, Bellowy and Ibarg\xFCengoitiaian. At times\
  \ I was reminded of Pebblehead.\n\u201CFor many years I have been strictly an eggs\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 bloaters man,\u201D he writes, \u201CBut in the interests of tiptop\
  \ literature of the highest quality, worthy of a Nobel Prize, I decided to eschew\
  \ my usual breakfast for a couple of days and eat porridge instead. On the first\
  \ day, it was thin, like gruel. On the second day, it was thick, like sludge.\u201D\
  \nOver the succeeding 849 pages, the author proceeds to extrapolate from this pair\
  \ of porridge consistencies a series of dazzling porridge-related extrapolations.\
  \ Not the least of his insights is his contention that the consistency of porridge,\
  \ at breakfast time, can serve as a dramatic bit of folderol in an award-winning\
  \ motion picture starring a Welsh actor who is tortured by the realisation that\
  \ his speaking voice is not, and never will be, as golden as that of his late compatriot\
  \ Richard Burton. One only needs to hear the latter intone the words \u201CBroadsword\
  \ to Danny Boy\u201D in Where Eagles Dare (Brian G Hutton, 1968) to know this, of\
  \ course, but Rex Foodwrite goes on to provide a shot-by-shot analysis of the film,\
  \ porridgeless as it is, which left this reader, at least, stunned.\nWhen I recovered\
  \ consciousness, The Consistency Of Porridge had fallen from my lap on to the floor,\
  \ where it was being nibbled by mice. I never returned it to the lending library.\n\
  ADDENDUM\_: The Redundancy Of Courage is a novel by Timothy Mo, not Kazuo Ishiguro.\
  \ This rather destroys the conceit of the above potsage [sic]. Oops.\n[2017-11-16]"
