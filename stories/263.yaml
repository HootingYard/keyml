text: "Is it just me, or does Donald Tusk sound more like the protagonist of a contemporary\
  \ American novel than the next Prime Minister of Poland? \u201CDonald Tusk\u201D\
  \ could be a plutocrat in a fat Tom Wolfe paperback, or a sidekick of Oscar Crease\
  \ in William Gaddis\u2019 superb A Frolic Of His Own.\nMr Tusk's Civic Platform\
  \ is likely to form a government in coalition with the Peasants\u2019 Party. Why\
  \ haven't we got a Peasants\u2019 Party here? I'd vote for a peasant to be put in\
  \ charge of things. Not a farmer, nor a Countryside Allianceista, but a proper peasant,\
  \ in a smock, with a piece of straw in their mouth, and a stock of folk wisdom which\
  \ I may well find incomprehensible. There must be a peasant called Hoouhmne who\
  \ could be persuaded to run for office, the sort of Prime Minister who would award\
  \ honours for the cultivation of Curiously Lumpen And Hirsute Root Vegetables so\
  \ that Miss Hathorn wouldn't have to strike her own medal.\n[2007-10-22]"
