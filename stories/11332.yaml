  \ picture today which struck me as remarkably familiar, and words from one of your\
  \ earlier writings came to mind:\n\u201CEach Saturday morning, I don the diving\
  \ helmet and cycle fourteen voots to a bucolic hamlet..\u201D\nYou may well have\
  \ seen this photo before, but while it was on my mind I wanted to take a moment\
  \ to thank you for making the world a more surreal place. Listening to Hooting Yard\
  \ is always a pleasure.\nI had not seen the picture before, and nor did I recall\
  \ the piece Ms Ying quoted\u2014not surprisingly, as it is nine years old, appearing\
  \ here in March 2004. Here are both the photograph (from this source) and my elderly\
  \ tale, What's On In Mustard Parva.\n\nMy diving helmet is made of gleaming brass.\
  \ I polish it once a week, on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the\
  \ diving helmet and cycle fourteen voots to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva.\n\
  (Curiously, there is no neighbouring village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic\
  \ barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of gaar in the local gaar-pot drinking\
  \ hut told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this\
  \ toothless derelict said, the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard\
  \ Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane\
  \ by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling\
  \ with a single thwack from its mighty paw. Two hours after the first bear lumbered\
  \ across Sawdust Bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown\
  \ on some maps.)\nJamming my bicycle into a kiosk on Mustard Parva's Yoko Ono Boulevard,\
  \ I join six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled\
  \ together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss\
  \ our diving helmets and take lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published\
  \ regularly through the good offices of the Mustard Parva Thing, whose editor is\
  \ none other than the blind cousin of Marigold Chew.\nSource\_: The Belle of Amherst\
