text: "I have decided to devote my life to birdsong. No, not that kind of birdsong,\
  \ all those trills and squawks and cooing noises that birds make. I mean songs about\
  \ birds. I have not quite worked everything out in my head, but the general idea\
  \ is to take familiar songs, not originally about birds, and to amend the lyrics\
  \ to make them more bird-focussed. I feel this would provide an invaluable musical\
  \ service for both humans and birds. As an example, here is the first fruit of my\
  \ project, a rewrite of David Bowie's 1979 hit Boys Keep Swinging. I hope you will\
  \ agree that this revised version is superior in every way, particularly from an\
  \ ornithological point of view.\nHeaven loves ya\n  The clouds part for ya\n  Nothing\
  \ stands in your way\n  When you're a grebe\nPlumage regales ya\n  Life is a pop\
  \ of the cherry\n  When you're a grebe\nWhen you're a grebe\n  You can soar through\
  \ the air\n  When you're a grebe\n  Other grebes check you out\n  You get a fish\n\
  \  These are your favourite things\n  When you're a grebe\nGrebes\n  Grebes\n  Grebes\
  \ keep swinging\n  Grebes always work it out\nUncage the colours\n  Unfurl the flag\n\
  \  Luck just kissed you hello\n  When you're a grebe\nThey'll never clone ya\n \
  \ You're always first on the line\n  When you're a grebe\nWhen you're a grebe\n\
  \  You can dabble about on a pond\n  When you're a grebe\n  Learn to dive and everything\n\
  \  You'll get your share\n  When you're a grebe\nGrebes\n  Grebes\n  Grebes keep\
  \ swinging\n  Grebes always work it out\n[2015-07-23]"
