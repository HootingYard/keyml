  \ professional broadcasters will have many stories to tell of Charles Wheeler, but\
  \ my favourite dates from the defection of Kim Philby at the height of the cold\
  \ war (Obituaries, July 5). Wheeler was asked whether he was surprised at Philby's\
  \ treason. \u201CNot really,\u201D replied Wheeler, \u201CI never really trusted\
  \ him. He was the sort of fellow who \u2026 smiled at breakfast, that sort of thing.\u201D\
  \ A great loss, fondly remembered.\n[2008-07-08]"
