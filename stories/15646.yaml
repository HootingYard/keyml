text: "\nHe was exceedingly pale, and he sat astride a horse. He was the Pale Horseman.\
  \ The horse was an elegant nut-brown something-or-other, with splendid fetlocks\
  \ and a terrific mane. I use the word \u201Cterrific\u201D because it was terrifying,\
  \ that mane, on that horse. It certainly terrified the horseman. Why do you think\
  \ he was so pale?\nClip-clop along the lane went the horse, through dense forest,\
  \ and the horseman sat tall in the saddle, like the best of heroes in a cowboy film.\
  \ Here it is worth noting that, though there are cowboys, there are no boy cows.\
  \ All cows, wherever in the world you roam, are girls. As for the horse, be it a\
  \ girl horse or boy horse, that does not matter to us, and nor did it matter to\
  \ the horseman, who shuddered as he contemplated its terrific mane. But he pulled\
  \ himself together, and clip-clopped onwards, or rather the horse clip-clopped,\
  \ while the horseman sat.\nThe lane stretched from Pointy Town at one end to Tantarabim\
  \ at the other. If you are familiar with the geography of this land\u2014and if\
  \ you are only half-educated, you damned well ought to be\u2014you will know it\
  \ was a very long lane indeed. The point where we met the Pale Horseman, deep in\
  \ the dense forest, was roughly halfway along the lane. He was on his way from Pointy\
  \ Town to Tantarabim.\nThere were many inns on or just off the lane, at which travellers\
  \ such as the Pale Horseman and his horse could spend the night. Each inn was named\
  \ after an album by Jethro Tull, except one, known as Exotic Birds And Fruit, which\
  \ shared its name with an album by Procol Harum. This anomaly was occasioned by\
  \ muddled thinking on the part of the Nomenclature of Inns Pursuivant. It was a\
  \ costly misattribution. He was taken out and shot.\nAs it happened, the clearing\
  \ in the forest where the execution took place was just yards away from where the\
  \ Pale Horseman stopped his horse, that morning. He was intent on paying homage\
  \ to the Pursuivant at the spot where he had fallen. While his horse scratched its\
  \ innocent behind on a tree, the Pale Horseman stood with head bowed in the clearing,\
  \ muttering a few words under his breath. Then, as a mark of devotion to the departed,\
  \ he placed on the ground a piece of fruit taken from his pocket. It was a toffee\
  \ apple.\nReturning to his horse, the Pale Horseman saw that it was disconcerted\
  \ and fractious, its mane even more terrific. Although he was already deathly pale,\
  \ such was his terror that the Pale Horseman visibly blanched. In the dense forest,\
  \ he was surrounded by wood, so had a French person been present, they could have\
  \ described him as \u201Cblanche doo bwa\u201D. He remounted his horse and set it\
  \ off at a clip-clop towards the seaside belvederes of Tantarabim.\nThat night they\
  \ stayed at the Catfish Rising inn. It was home to a cat, but not to any fish, unless\
  \ one counted a few blennies, dead on a slab in the kitchen, ready to be served\
  \ for supper. The Pale Horseman was not fond of fish, and opted instead for jugged\
  \ hare with a side helping of smokers\u2019 poptarts. These vittles did nothing\
  \ to alter his pallor. Anent the inn, in its stables, the horse was fed and watered\
  \ from a cement trough. Somewhere in the night, owls hooted and swooped upon small\
  \ terrified scurrying mammals.\nUsually, whenever I recite this story, I pause at\
  \ this point and invite questions from the audience, if there is one. Sometimes\
  \ there is not. I have told this story while standing on a dais in an empty barn.\
  \ But if one or two are gathered to hear it, the questions most often asked are\
  \ Why is the Pale Horseman going from Pointy Town to Tantatrabim? and Please level\
  \ with us, is the Pale Horseman a personification of Death? Very occasionally someone\
  \ will ask me to explain what was so terrifying about the horse's mane. But nobody,\
  \ nobody, has ever asked What was the horse's name? or Did the horse become fractious\
  \ because it thought it was going to be given the toffee apple as a snack?\nWhatever\
  \ questions I am asked, I like to give full and detailed answers, at great length.\
  \ Thus, for example, I might find myself listing every single album release by Jethro\
  \ Tull. Not only do I give the album titles, in chronological order, but I will\
  \ add the track listing and full credits as shown on the sleeve of the original\
  \ release. If in puckish mood, I will also recite, from memory, any liner notes,\
  \ which, in the case of Thick As A Brick (1972), can take up most of the afternoon.\
  \ If in even more puckish mood, I will do the same for the complete Procol Harum\
  \ discography. My knowledge of horsemen and horses is equally encyclopaedic, so\
  \ by the time I am done answering questions, any audience members still awake will\
  \ almost certainly have forgotten the story so far. They may even have had the Pale\
  \ Horseman and his horse and the lane from Pointy Town to Tantarabim wiped from\
  \ their puny brains, while they fixate upon, say, the precise pattern upon the headband\
  \ habitually worn by \u201Cstout, nimble\u201D Glenn Cornick, bass guitarist of\
  \ Jethro Tull from 1968 to 1970.\nWhen I resume my tale, therefore, they barely\
  \ notice that the Pale Horseman and his horse are clip-clopping slowly, slowly along\
  \ the lane in the opposite direction, from Tantarabim to Pointy Town. When I have\
  \ them stop around half-way, at the clearing where the Nomenclature of Inns Pursuivant\
  \ was shot, and the Pale Horseman retrieves the votive toffee apple, removes its\
  \ cellophane wrapping, and feeds it as a snack to his horse, some in the audience\
  \ put up their hands to ask how in the name of heaven the Pale Horseman knew the\
  \ toffee apple was there, lying on the ground in the clearing a few yards off the\
  \ lane, but I shush them and tell them the time for questions is over.\nAnd so it\
  \ is that they never get to hear how Death was visited upon Tantarabim, how every\
  \ last Tantarabimite, from aged crones to tots and tinies, toppled over and died\
  \ at sight of the Pale Horseman, as due punishment for some ancient sin, and how\
  \ for a hundred years or more it was home only to swarms of flies and maggots, and\
  \ nobody dared utter its name.\n[2017-09-13]"
