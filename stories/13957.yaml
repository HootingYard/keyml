text: "The other day I met a man who claimed he could eat his own head. I considered\
  \ this preposterous, and said so. We were at a sophisticated cocktail party and\
  \ he was leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece.\n\u201CI can prove it to you,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CAs a demonstration, I will eat your head, and that will show that\
  \ I could eat my own.\u201D\nI thought about this for perhaps three seconds before\
  \ responding.\n\u201CYour so-called proof has several distinct flaws,\u201D I said,\
  \ \u201CFirst, that if you eat my head, I will be in no position to form a judgement\
  \ on the success or otherwise of your antics, as I presume I will lose consciousness\
  \ and die as you gnaw through my neck, thus severing those all-important nerves\
  \ and arteries and whatnot that enable my brain to function. Second, your ability\
  \ to eat my head has no bearing whatsoever on your claim to be able to eat your\
  \ own head. It is an entirely different head.\u201D\nHe took a sip of his cocktail\
  \ before conceding.\n\u201CThose are both valid points. But there were but two,\
  \ and you said you had several.\u201D\n\u201CLet those two suffice for the time\
  \ being,\u201D I said.\n\u201CVery well,\u201D he replied, \u201CI can see that\
  \ I am up against a sceptic of formidable mental acuity. You are not by any chance\
  \ a Jesuit, are you?\u201D\nI assured him I was not, despite it having been a childhood\
  \ ambition to be ordained into the order.\n\u201CI, too, once dreamed of becoming\
  \ a Jesuit,\u201D he said, \u201CBut alas, I lost my faith. Still, that was a long\
  \ time ago, since when I suppose I learned to replace it with the more fervent belief\
  \ that I can eat my own head. You will not be satisfied until you actually witness\
  \ me in the act of doing so, will you?\u201D\nI nodded my agreement. He looked at\
  \ me in silence, and after a pause, said \u201CThere\u201D.\n\u201CThere what?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201CI just ate my own head and regurgitated it, as a bird does with\
  \ food for its young.\u201D he said, \u201CYou must excuse my manners, for I am\
  \ a terribly fast eater and tend to gobble my food. I can be quite a cause of social\
  \ discomfiture in the better restaurants.\u201D\n\u201CI witnessed neither eating\
  \ nor regurgitation,\u201D I said, \u201CYou just stood there looking at me.\u201D\
  \nHe sighed with a measure of impatience.\n\u201CI have just explained to you that\
  \ I eat with regrettable speed,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd this habit has a deleterious\
  \ effect on my digestive system, one consequence of which is that I cannot tolerate\
  \ certain foodstuffs, including human flesh and bone and brain matter, etcetera,\
  \ so I spew them up immediately.\u201D\n\u201CYou are a very foolish man. Good evening\
  \ to you, sir,\u201D I said, and I turned on my heel and wandered off across the\
  \ room, away from the mantelpiece, in search of somebody else to talk to.\nLater\
  \ that evening, passing near the mantelpiece again, I saw the man biting the head\
  \ off another party guest, a person who, I reasoned, had not had the benefits of\
  \ a Jesuitical education, and thus could not counter the arguments of this foolish\
  \ but persuasive fellow. There was blood on the carpet, as there so often is, even\
  \ at the most sophisticated cocktail parties.\n[2015-04-20]"
