text: 'I ought to have mentioned this earlier, but better late than never. 2008 is
  the International Year Of The Potato. So whether you champion Accords or Belle de
  Fontenays or Caras or Carlingfords or Charlottes or Desirees or Duke of Yorks or
  Dundrods or Estimas or Fiannas or Golden Wonders or Harmonies or Kerr''s Pinks or
  King Edwards or Marfonas or Maris Bards or Maris Peers or Maris Pipers or Nadines
  or Nicolas or Ospreys or Pentland Javelins or Pink Fir Apples or Premieres or Rockets
  or Romanos or Roosters or Santes or Saxons or Vivaldis or Wiljas, be sure to devote
  much of your time and energy this year to potato-related activities. Hooting Yard
  will be getting into the groove with a series of potato-postings as the months go
  by, so keep your eyes peeled.
