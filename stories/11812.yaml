text: "Dough, a dear, a female dear, a dear one, made out of dough. This was the bold\
  \ conception of Istvan, the eerie Mitteleuropean baker whose pastry shop was hidden\
  \ down an insalubrious alleyway in an insalubrious provincial town at the foot of\
  \ a huge important mountain range. You will find it on most maps.\nLugubrious, insanitary,\
  \ and topped by a pudding basin haircut, Istvan was beset by constant pangs. He\
  \ longed for companionship. Alas, he was a stranger to that paradise of which the\
  \ Brothers Johnson sang, the Land of Ladies. Though there were many women among\
  \ his customers, they all hurried away as soon as they had bought their baked goods,\
  \ alarmed and distressed by Istvan's unbecoming personal appearance, his filthy\
  \ manners, and his lack of charm.\nSo it was that he decided to make his longed-for\
  \ dearest out of dough. Ignorant of women, he chose as his model a nun, specifically\
  \ Maria in The Sound Of Music, played by Julie Andrews. Having prepared sufficient\
  \ dough for a life-size nun, he kneaded and kneaded and moulded it into shape. When\
  \ he was done, he placed it in a reclining position on the sofa in the back room\
  \ of his pastry shop.\nAnd so, for a while, his evenings were happy, happier than\
  \ they had ever been. He would sit at one end of the sofa, his hand patting his\
  \ dough companion gently, and he would talk to it, or sit in contented silence.\
  \ He no longer felt alone. And \u201CMaria\u201D was unabashed by his lugubrious\
  \ and insanitary person, did not look askance at his pudding basin haircut, and\
  \ tolerated his filthy manners.\nBut Istvan grew dissatisfied. His pangs returned,\
  \ more intense than ever, for he wished that his dough dear would do more than merely\
  \ sprawl on the sofa. How much dearer she would be if she were a true companion,\
  \ one who laughed and sang and helped out with the baking of pastries! If only she\
  \ could be imbued, Frankenstein-fashion, with the spark of life!\nAnd then one day\
  \ into the pastry shop came a mysterious wizardy type of fellow, swathed in a black\
  \ cape and wearing a pointy hat. He made purchase of some Mitteleuropean pastry\
  \ delicacies, but before he swished his cape and strode away, Istvan dared to ask\
  \ him if by any chance he knew of spells to bring to life a nun made out of dough.\
  \ I do indeed, said the wizard.\nA bargain was struck, and Istvan ushered the mysterious\
  \ fellow into the back room. He stood over the dough nun on the sofa, slowly waving\
  \ his arms in strangely significant passing movements, and babbling gibberish. Istvan\
  \ looked on, goggle-eyed, which made his appearance even more unbecoming than usual.\
  \ When he was finished, the wizardy man turned to Istvan and told him that the final\
  \ stage of the spell, the part that would bring his dough dear to life, was to bake\
  \ the dough in a pre-heated oven on 220\xBAC, 200\xBAC\_for fan-assisted ovens,\
  \ or Gas Mark 7, for 40 minutes. And then he swept out of the back room, swishing\
  \ his black cape, out of the front door and into the insalubrious alleyway in the\
  \ insalubrious provincial town, in the shadow of an important mountain range, and\
  \ Istvan never saw him again.\nBarely able to contain his excitement, the eerie\
  \ baker picked up his dough dear from the sofa and cradled her in his arms, then\
  \ shoved her into the oven, which was already preheated, what with all the baking\
  \ the baker did. For the next forty minutes, Istvan sat gazing at the hands of his\
  \ Mitteleuropean cuckoo clock, ticktocking through the time with agonising slowness.\
  \ At last the baking time elapsed. But just as Istvan was about to open the oven,\
  \ the door swung open from inside. Of course! His dough dear was alive! Out she\
  \ would step, into his arms!\nBut in the baking, the transformation was greater\
  \ than Istvan could have imagined. It was not a living dough Julie Andrews that\
  \ emerged from the oven. It was a living pastry Christopher Plummer! As it lumbered\
  \ towards Istvan, it plucked from nowhere a guitar, and began to sing \u201CEdelweiss\u201D\
  . The baker fell back upon his sofa, stricken with horror.\nThey found him there\
  \ the next morning, his unbecoming features twisted in an awful rictus. Of the pastry\
  \ Christopher Plummer, there was no sign, though some say that, on clear bright\
  \ days when the air is still, he can be heard singing in the mountains that loom\
  \ over the insalubrious provincial Mitteleuropean town.\n\nDon't forget you can\
  \ donate to keep the wolf from Mr Key's door.\n[2013-07-31]"
