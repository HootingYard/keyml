text: 'Last night, Abi Ofarim was presented with a sheep.

  There was a broader context to this exciting scene, but alas it was obliterated
  the instant I awoke. All that remains is a smiling Abi, circa 1967, taking in his
  arms a non-smiling sheep.

  I would be pleased to hear from any brain-quacks who feel competent to interpret
  this phantasm.
