  \ a fortuitous find in a secondhand bookshop. I thought I would follow his example,\
  \ for yesterday I was in Rye, and in a tiny bookshop called the Tiny Bookshop I\
  \ was happy to come upon a 1956 Penguin copy of Passages From Arabia Deserta by\
  \ Charles Montagu Doughty, for a mere three pounds.\n\nThis is an abridged version\
  \ of Doughty's best-known work, Travels In Arabia Deserta, which was extolled by\
  \ The Observer thus: \u201CCharles Montagu Doughty was one of the great men of our\
  \ day, the author of a unique prose masterpiece. For many readers it is a book so\
  \ majestic, so vital, of such incomparable beauty of thought, of observation, and\
  \ of diction as to occupy a place apart among their most cherished literary possessions\u201D\
  .\nI have written about Doughty before, with particular reference to his strangely\
  \ hypnotic prose. Never having had the courage to tackle the Travels in their vast\
  \ entirety, I shall look forward to reading this abridgement\u2014still over 300\
  \ pages.\n[2013-10-30]"
