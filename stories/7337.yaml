text: "\nIt's been an unaccountably quiet week here at Hooting Yard, I'm afraid, but\
  \ Friday would not be Friday without something in my cupboard at The Dabbler. And\
  \ lo! This week I sing the praises of the London Library\u2014or, to be precise,\
  \ I was going to, until I discovered someone else's recent blog postage that said\
  \ almost exactly what I would have said by way of introduction to this heaven on\
  \ earth. So, instead, I link to that postage, and praise instead a forgotten writer\
  \ whose work I have found on the book-crammed shelves of the library.\nThere is\
  \ another brief but useful introduction to the London Library in this In Praise\
  \ Of\u2026 piece from The Guardian last year. It's worth noting, I think, that seven\
  \ of the twelve commenters there moan about the cost of membership. I get the impression\
  \ that such people would complain whatever the cost, simply because it is a private\
  \ institution open only to paying members. I'm surprised the word \u201Celitist\u201D\
  \ appears nowhere in the comments.\nBut sense and perspective are provided by one\
  \ \u2018cunningfox\u2019, who writes \u201C\xA31.08 a day. Best bargain in London.\
  \ What else are you going to spend it on that's half so worthwhile?\u201D Indeed\
  \ so. I am quite alarmingly poverty-stricken, but even I can find a daily quid to\
  \ stump up for access to fifteen miles of shelves groaning with books. It is all\
  \ a question of choice. I recall, a few years ago, attending a gig by the great\
  \ John Bently, where he had some of his Liver & Lights artist's books for sale.\
  \ I overheard some ragamuffin whingeing that they were too expensive, as he slurped\
  \ his (expensive) pint and headed off to the bar to buy another round. He probably\
  \ spent more on beer that evening than a couple of Bently's books would have cost\
  \ him.\n[2011-09-30]"
