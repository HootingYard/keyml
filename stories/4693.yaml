text: "\u201CSix thousand years have passed since we were set to till the ground,\
  \ from which we were taken. How much of it is tilled? How much of that which is,\
  \ wisely or well? In the very centre and chief garden of Europe\u2014where the two\
  \ forms of parent Christianity have had their fortresses\u2014where the noble Catholics\
  \ of the Forest Cantons, and the noble Protestants of the Vaudois valleys, have\
  \ maintained, for dateless ages, their faiths and liberties\u2014there the unchecked\
  \ Alpine rivers yet run wild in devastation ; and the marshes, which a few hundred\
  \ men could redeem with a year's labour, still blast their helpless inhabitants\
  \ into fevered idiotism.\u201D\nJohn Ruskin, The Mystery Of Life And Its Arts (1868)\n\
