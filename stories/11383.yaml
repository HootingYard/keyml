text: "\nGenerations of tinies have grown up learning the nursery rhyme with the Roud\
  \ Folk Song Index number 21143, to wit:\nRide a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,\n \
  \ To see a fine lady upon a white horse;\n  Rings on her fingers and bells on her\
  \ toes,\n  And she shall have music wherever she goes.\nIn a recent earth-shattering\
  \ research paper, published in The Weekly Earth-Shattering Research Papers Digest,\
  \ boffins at the Centre For Banbury Cross Studies make a convincing argument that\
  \ the third line of the rhyme is wrong. Using state of the art techniques involving\
  \ a big magnetic robot, they claim that it ought to read\nWrinkles on her fingers\
  \ and boils on her toes.\nThe lady may indeed be fine, but she is also a crone,\
  \ or a hag. It is thought that she is related by sisterhood to both the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman and the Woman of Twigs, and Shakespeare probably had the trio in mind when\
  \ he was writing The Tragedie Of Macbeth.\nIn a related development, other boffins\
  \ at a different Centre, for other Studies, have been using state of the art techniques\
  \ involving a tiny rubber nozzle to identify the music that the lady with wrinkles\
  \ on her fingers and boils on her toes was listening to wherever she went. Their\
  \ unarguable case is that the music was some particularly argumentative German improv\
  \ racket, made with dustbin lids and hammers and hideous electronic buzzing noises.\n\
  Together, these two studies shed an entirely new light on the nursery rhyme. It\
  \ is a light that the present day inhabitants of Banbury Cross find unwelcome, and\
  \ there have been mutterings in the streets, and dark deeds plotted in the taverns,\
  \ and pebbles thrown at boffins. Excitingly, the latter hoo-hah has given rise to\
  \ the creation of a brand new nursery rhyme:\nRide a cock-horse to Banbury Cross\n\
  \  To see all the citizens get very cross\n  Let's all throw pebbles at the boffins\n\
  \  Until they end up in their coffins.\n[2013-05-06]"
