text: "It looks as if much had been neglected in our country's system of defence.\
  \ Yes, Fort Hoity is famously impregnable, and Fort Toity likewise. But the fence\
  \ linking them, running along the frontier, had been constructed from balsa wood\
  \ and lollipop sticks. And when the swarm of specially-trained border wasps was\
  \ wiped out by Hulbert-Courtneidge Disease, otherwise known as Border Wasp Wipeout\
  \ Syndrome, the flimsiness of the fence had become all too apparent.\nOur neighbours\
  \ are ferocious and barbaric. Night after night, on the other side of the fence,\
  \ they light bonfires and dance in circles round them, screaming impious guttural\
  \ cries and waving pitchforks. They are unfathomably stupid. To date, they have\
  \ been kept at bay by the papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 wasps gummed to lollipop sticks at\
  \ regular intervals along the frontier. The effectiveness of this defensive measure\
  \ is unlikely to last. The puppet wasps cannot withstand torrential rainfall, of\
  \ which there is much, in torrents, and our factories cannot churn out sufficient\
  \ replacements, because of the shortages.\nFrom Fort Hoity, as also from Fort Toity,\
  \ we take snipes at our barbarian foe by launching snipe at them. For those of you\
  \ who know little or nothing about flying things with wings and beaks and feathers,\
  \ the snipe is a type of bird. It has a long, sharp, pointy bill or beak (see previous\
  \ sentence). Our snipe are specially trained to swoop relentlessly towards barbarians,\
  \ and to pierce them with their pointy beaks, ideally puncturing one of the major\
  \ arteries. Note that, as with sheep and teal, the plural of snipe is snipe. I do\
  \ not know why that is the case. Ask an ornitholinguist.\nOne drawback of our sniping\
  \ is that, for all their savagery, our neighbours seem to have a way with birds.\
  \ The original idea was that, having stabbed and slain a barbarian, the snipe would\
  \ turn around and fly back to Fort Hoity (or Fort Toity), ready to be relaunched\
  \ for another attack. But the barbarians cosset the snipe, and feed them millet\
  \ and tiny terrified mammals, and make pets of them, and\u2014maddeningly\u2014\
  the snipe thrive in their care. We are fortunate that thus far the savages have\
  \ not yet worked out how to get the snipe to attack us.\nOne of our brightest engineers\
  \ has devised a plan to dig a ha-ha along the length of the fence between Fort Hoity\
  \ and Fort Toity. Thus, if the barbarians did manage to breach the balsa wood and\
  \ lollipop sticks and papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 wasps, they would immediately topple in\
  \ to the ha-ha. They would be trapped like sitting ducks, and our forces could then\
  \ make short work of them by dropping in a mass of violets and other flowers, smothering\
  \ them as Heliogabalus did his enemies. Before we can put this plan into action,\
  \ we need to convert much of our farmland into plantations for violets and other\
  \ flowers, so we have enough for the smothering.\nMeanwhile, our Black Ops team\
  \ conducts various black ops on both sides of the border. By their nature, black\
  \ ops are carried out under the radar. As we do not have a radar, we fashioned a\
  \ convincing counterfeit by attaching a couple of wire coat-hangers to the top of\
  \ a lamppost near Fort Hoity, and another one near Fort Toity. So pig-ignorant and\
  \ backward are the barbarians, they are completely taken in. Baffled by our superior\
  \ technology, they think a coat-hanger is the work of the devil\u2014and that is\
  \ when it is used for its original purpose. As a faux radar, they think it is the\
  \ work of two devils.\nThreatened as we are by brutes on the border, there is perhaps\
  \ a greater peril lurking in our midst. I speak of the enemy within, the peaceniks.\
  \ They are growing in number, in spite of our efficient secret police and the Friday\
  \ night head-boilings at both Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. These \u201Cuseful idiots\u201D\
  \ deny that our neighbours are barbaric savages who wish us harm, insisting rather\
  \ that they are lovely people who just grunt rather more than we do. Look how they\
  \ care for their snipe!, these nitwits cry, ignoring the fact that they are our\
  \ snipe, primed to kill, and treacherously bought off by the barbarians with millet\
  \ and tiny terrified mammals.\nOf equal concern to the authorities is the fashionable\
  \ theory, currently being bruited about the cement water-troughs of our fauborgs,\
  \ that there is no land at all on the other side of the fence, no barbarians, just\
  \ the sea, the vast wet illimitable sea that stretches forever, to the ends of the\
  \ earth. Proponents of this codswallop maintain that the bonfires we see are strange\
  \ inexplicable atmospheric phenomena, that the barbarians dancing in circles round\
  \ them, screaming impious guttural cries and waving pitchforks are mere sea-sprites,\
  \ phantoms of wind and water and the play of the light. This is a misunderstanding\
  \ of some kind; and it will be the ruin of us.\nThe first sentence, and the last,\
  \ were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between\
  \ was not.\n[2018-02-22]"
