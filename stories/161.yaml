  \ each time his strong and hypersensitive reactions. Anything might throw the boy\
  \ into a fit, cause cramps or compulsive shivers, or plunge him into a sudden unconsciousness.\
  \ Daumer wondered at the odd succession of the boy's sensitivities. Thunderstorms,\
  \ the full moon, brandy, loud noises, quiet noises, squeezed cheese, bright daylight,\
  \ beer, cats, spiders, snakes, flowers and grape juice\u2014all these things powerfully\
  \ moved him. He was also found to dislike beards, the colour black, and comedy.\u201D\
