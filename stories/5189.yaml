text: "It is monumentally curious, is it not, that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\
  \ won renown in sports which are not, themselves, remotely fictional? Polevaulting\
  \ and haring round and round a running track are both activities in which plenty\
  \ of non-fictional athletes have taken part, in the past as in the present day.\
  \ Now, the release of previously repressed passages from the Memoirs of Bobnit Tivol's\
  \ coach and mentor, the catarrh-wracked, Homburg-wearing Old Halob, show how sporting\
  \ history might have taken a different path.\nUnlike his prot\xE9g\xE9, Old Halob\
  \ was of course all too terrifyingly real, yet he harboured a deep love for fictitious\
  \ sports. While Bobnit Tivol was scampering round and round those cinder running\
  \ tracks following his punishing training regime, Old Halob, we now learn, was dreaming\
  \ of pitting his champion against Markus Geissler, the big Austrian, in a Guyball\
  \ match. It remained a dream, for all the cantankerous trainer's attempts to enrol\
  \ the fictional athlete in a Guyball team came to naught through a series of mishaps.\
  \ Telegrams went astray, railway timetables proved to be forgeries, buses crashed,\
  \ the addresses on envelopes were smudged to illegibility by rainfall\u2026 those\
  \ sorts of mishap dogged Old Halob.\nLater in the same year, he was in secret talks\
  \ with John Tetrad and Max Quad in an attempt to have Bobnit Tivol join their fennel\
  \ team. In this case, it seems negotiations were far advanced, and only fell apart\
  \ when nobody could find a fictional pen with which the fictional athlete could\
  \ sign on the fictional dotted line of a fictional contract. This prompted the strange,\
  \ almost hallucinatory passage in the repressed Memoirs where Old Halob blathers\
  \ on for page after page bemoaning the non-existence of a well-stocked fictional\
  \ stationery shop.\nTake it from me, the Repressed Memoirs Of Old Halob is suitable\
  \ reading for repressed sport enthusiasts of any stripe.\n[2010-09-06]"
