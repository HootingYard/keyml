  \  Shoveller, shoveller, lay down your spade,\n  Let us go tiptoe thro\u2019 a verdant\
  \ glade.\nNot on your nelly, for shovel I must\n  The muck and the filth and the\
  \ pebbles and dust,\n  I must shovel it all into Widdecombe Ditch\n  And cover it\
  \ o'er with tar and pitch.\n  Shoveller, shoveller, come skip with me\n  Round about\
  \ the linden tree\n  We'll skip in circles 'til we drop\n  Then go to the kiosk\
  \ for a drink of pop.\nAway with you, temptress! Siren! Witch!\n  I only drink water\
  \ from Widdecombe Ditch.\n  It's black and brackish and tastes quite foul.\n  Damn\
  \ you, shoveller! [She turns into an owl.]\n[2014-07-29]"
