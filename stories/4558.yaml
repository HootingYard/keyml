text: "\u201CThe small bones of poultry, preserved in a hole in a wall, the medullary\
  \ channel being left intact, will immediately cure tooth-ache, they say, if the\
  \ tooth is touched or the gum scarified therewith, care being taken to throw away\
  \ the bone the moment the operation is performed. A similar result is obtained by\
  \ using raven's dung, wrapped in wool and attached to the body, or else sparrow's\
  \ dung, warmed with oil and injected into the ear on the side affected. This last\
  \ remedy, however, is productive of an intolerable itching, for which reason it\
  \ is considered a better plan to rub the part with the ashes of young sparrows burnt\
  \ upon twigs, mixed with vinegar for the purpose.\u201D\nPliny The Elder, The Natural\
  \ History (AD 77\u201379)\n[2010-05-31]"
