text: "Lupe Node, the carrier, O is he dead then? My fruit-bowl all emptied. He carried\
  \ my fruit, Lupe Node, in his manly muscular hands, plums in punnets and hawberries\
  \ in hopkins. The sun battered him, as he sashayed from orchard to pier, to my kiosk,\
  \ this man o\u2019 fruit, Jesuitical in his furrow-browed beanstalk bitterness.\
  \ A man of few words, and those the names of fruits, names he made up, embroidered,\
  \ spat out like plum-stones, chewed like nettles, O Lupe Node, forsaken by a God\
  \ whose mercurial recklessness\u2014those divine spasms!\u2014came twitching in\
  \ rags and schmutter. Pips haunted him, Lupe Node, lodged in his pocket-crannies,\
  \ scattered in his locks, curly black and slathered in lac. Do not taunt him now,\
  \ in his grave, on his uppers, worm-lunch, bird-roost. They named a pond for him.\
  \ No fish thrive inwith it. And yet in memory of Lupe Node I take my paper bag of\
  \ baggings there each March morning sodden by rain and stamped by yearning. Crumbs\
  \ fall. Necks sag. Galoshes splosh.\n[2018-05-01]"
