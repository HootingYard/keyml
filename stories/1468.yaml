text: "During one of her thrilling adventures\u2014it may have been the time when\
  \ she rescued some ducks from a toxic puddle\u2014Tiny Enid suffered a clonk on\
  \ the head. Thereafter, every so often, she began to have visions, and she became\
  \ convinced that she was seeing tableaux from her previous lives. It had never before\
  \ occurred to the plucky tot that she might have lived before, under other guises,\
  \ and that \u201CTiny Enid\u201D was but one character her Gaar, or essence of being,\
  \ had inhabited. Her mysterious mentor, whom we have a very vague picture of from\
  \ earlier Tiny Enid adventure stories, pooh-poohed her visions and recommended that\
  \ she eat heartier breakfasts, but Tiny Enid was wedded to her morning milk slops\
  \ and had an independent spirit. Although she valued her mysterious mentor's sage\
  \ counsel, she also thought him a bit of a doddery old foolish person, and she picked\
  \ and chose which pieces of advice to follow. In many ways Tiny Enid's personality\
  \ was akin to that of Charles Lindbergh, the aviation ace, daring and reckless and\
  \ with a fascist bent. Chronologically, of course, it was impossible that Tiny Enid\
  \ could be the reincarnation of Lindbergh, and in any case, in all her past life\
  \ hallucinations she was a girl. Most of the time, too, she was tiny.\nContemporary\
  \ fans of the heroic infant, those who keep her memory alive, often seem embarrassed\
  \ by this aspect of Tiny Enid's character. They prefer to think of her as level-headed\
  \ and no-nonsense and gritty, and of course she was all these, but drawing a veil\
  \ over her post-head-clonk belief in various types of ethereal woo does her a disservice.\
  \ To see Tiny Enid in the round is to accept that she thought her Gaar was as real\
  \ as a pebble she could hold in her hand and as important as a telegram alerting\
  \ her to the imperilment of some ducks in a toxic puddle.\nOne Tiny Enidist who\
  \ is keen to pay due attention to this sort of guff is Basil Groove. The name may\
  \ be familiar to those of you who grooved to the fab sounds of the sixties, for\
  \ Basil was a member of the psychedelic pop group Turquoise Eye Of The Lobster King.\
  \ Having hung up his plectrum, Basil Groove has been scouring the world's picture\
  \ libraries seeking illustrations which depict figures who may be Tiny Enid avant\
  \ l'Enid, as it were. He has compiled these into an album to be published later\
  \ this year, entitled Scenes From The Past Lives Of Plucky Tot Tiny Enid, and it\
  \ is with great pleasure that we are able to show one of the drawings here. It shows\
  \ a small female child, armed only with a pin-cushion and a pencil sharpener, confronting\
  \ a dreadful knight. She may not have a club foot, but, as Basil Groove says, \u201C\
  who else could this possibly be than the fearless infant heroine whose venturesomeness\
  \ delights us all?\u201D\n\n[2009-01-19]"
