text: "Here are a few notes\u2014by no means conclusive\u2014from Mr Key's American\
  \ sojourn. Further bulletins may follow.\nI met a fanatical devotee of Jethro Tull,\
  \ with whom I shared observations about the first four or five LPs and the apparel\
  \ worn by the flautist Anderson in the early days.\nI am minded to note that what\
  \ British people call a \u201Cflannel\u201D and Americans call a \u201Cwashcloth\u201D\
  \ has always been known in my family as a \u201Cfacecloth\u201D. This is possibly\
  \ due to a transliteration by my Flemish-speaking Ma.\_ It has been decreed that\
  \ henceforth the social networking application Facebook will be referred to as Facecloth.\
  \ All Hooting Yard readers and listeners are expected to adopt the new term exclusively\
  \ and with immediate effect.\nI met a couple who have a pet eel named Peaches. Sadly,\
  \ I did not meet Peaches The Eel herself. (Himself? Itself?)\n[2009-11-27]"
