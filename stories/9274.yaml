text: "I mentioned yesterday Jack Warner's fantastic cheese-and-biscuits recipe, included\
  \ in The Curious Cookbook by Peter Ross. The original source is a wartime collection\
  \ entitled A Kitchen Goes To War\_: Famous People Contribute 150 Recipes To A Ration-Time\
  \ Cookery Book (1940). Among the other dishes is the splendidly-named Agatha Christie's\
  \ Mystery Potatoes. I was intending to transcribe the recipe here, then realised\
  \ that in so doing I would shatter the mystery, so instead I will urge\u2014or indeed\
  \ egg you on\u2014to buy the book.\nMeanwhile, you might be interested in making\
  \ imitation bacon out of marzipan. Who wouldn't be?\nTake some of your marchpane\
  \ [marzipan] Paste, and work it in red saunders [sandalwood\u2014a red dye] till\
  \ it be red; then rowl a broad sheet of white paste, and a sheet of red paste; three\
  \ of the white and four of the red, and so one upon the other in mingled sorts,\
  \ every red between, then cut it overthwart, till it look like collops [slices]\
  \ of bacon, then dry it.\nThat is from A Queen's Delight of 1671, and given the\
  \ title I suggest you make some to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.\n\nThe Queen Of\
  \ Crime, contemplating her mysterious potatoes\n[2012-05-25]"
