  \ she worked her way through the classics of literature. Nowadays, we just slump\
  \ in front of the television and watch foreign-language thrillers on BBC4. Thus\
  \ I have embarked upon a crash-course in Danish by watching, somewhat belatedly,\
  \ Forbrydelsen, or The Killing, the highly popular murder \u2018n\u2019 knitwear\
  \ detective series. Apart from being a splendid example of Nick Cohen's observation\
  \ that ethnic minorities are never the villains in BBC cop shows, the series has\
  \ done wonders for my Danish language skills. I think I could successfully apply\
  \ for an IT post in Copenhagen, armed with these additions to my vocabulary:\nEnglish\_\
  : computer. Danish\_: compuder.\nEnglish\_: password. Danish\_: password.\nEnglish\_\
  : fuck-up. Danish\_: fuck-up.\n[2011-05-16]"
