  \ write a book I think it would read something like Mein Kampf.\u201D\xC2\_\_He\
  \ describes his cat as a wicked, embittered creature, which is almost certainly\
  \ true of all cats, whose saving grace is their unfathomable stupidity. It is this\
  \ combination of characteristics which makes them so engaging, unlike dogs. As we\
  \ have seen, dogs are boring.\nWe can adduce further evidence of cats\u2019 fundamental\
  \ malevolence from Nerea De Clifford. In her study What British Cats Think About\
  \ Television, she wrote: \u201CMost cats show an interest of some kind, though it\
  \ is often of hostility\u2026 a significant reaction is the display of excitement\
  \ when any picture, especially of birds, moves quickly across the screen.\u201D\
  \ (Previously quoted in the Archives, March 2004.)\nHere is a photograph of Nerea\
  \ De Clifford, described by the Cats Protection League as \u201Ca popular and gracious\
  \ lady\u201D.\n\n[2009-04-16]"
