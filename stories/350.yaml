text: "On Tuesday morning I was woken by the hectic clanging of the bells of St Bibblybibdib's.\
  \ I had been dreaming about a monkey as big as a planet, as I sometimes do. Using\
  \ the Bl\xF6tzmann technique, I squeezed the sleep out of my brain, clambered out\
  \ of bed, and threw my windows wide open. I was rather disconcerted to note that,\
  \ as Milton put it in Book IV of Paradise Lost, \u201Cthe starry cope of Heaven\u2026\
  \ or all the elements / At least, had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn\u201D, for\
  \ Monday had been mild with sunny intervals and there had been no sign of cosmic\
  \ cataclysm. Indeed, I had made a point of watching Daniel Corbett's early evening\
  \ weather forecast on the BBC, and that always reliable and beautifully well-spoken\
  \ presenter had said nothing at all about wrack, disturbance, and a tearing in the\
  \ heavens, as far as I could remember.\nI had, however, taken the precaution of\
  \ making a copy of his forecast on my bakelite televisual simulacrumating device,\
  \ and the steam would have dispersed overnight, making it ready for viewing, so\
  \ I went into the parlour and depressed the starting knob. I was keen to see if\
  \ my memory was playing tricks, for there seemed to be no other explanation for\
  \ the disjuncture between Daniel Corbett's prognostications and the foul reality\
  \ outwith my windows. While I waited for the valves to warm up, I recalled that\
  \ the monkey in my dream had been about as big as the planet Mercury. In earlier\
  \ dreams it had been the size of one of those gigantic gas planets you read about,\
  \ and I wondered if this shrinkage was something to be welcomed or, indeed, feared.\
  \ It was hard to tell.\nI sat down on my stool and pulled my crumpled hessian nightshirt\
  \ tight about my torso, and the simulacrumating device hissed into life. There,\
  \ as if by magic, was Daniel Corbett again, telling me about the weather, dumbfounding\
  \ me. For as he moved his arms in graceful scooping gestures, like a meteorological\
  \ ballerina, his words were not those I remembered from yesterday evening, but those\
  \ of Milton. Dan said that \u201Cthe starry cope of Heaven\u2026 or all the elements\
  \ / At least,\u201D will go \u201Cto wrack, disturbed and torn\u201D. And he was\
  \ right, of course, for that was precisely what was happening outside.\nI had concentrated\
  \ like mad watching him the day before, as I always do, and I was absolutely convinced\
  \ that what his simulacrum was saying now was not what I had heard then. The bakelite\
  \ device could not be at fault, for I had had a person from Porlock come to give\
  \ it an overhaul but a week before, and he had pronounced it to be in full working\
  \ order. Was my brain being monkeyed with by the planet-sized monkey of my dreams?\
  \ I watched Dan Corbett again, three times, and three times he spoke of wrack. Shutting\
  \ down the device, I changed into my crumpled hessian outdoor clothing and hurried\
  \ down the lane to St Bibblybibdib's. The bells still clanged as I staggered into\
  \ a pew and prayed as hard as I could for my immortal soul, on Tuesday morning.\n\
