text: "The Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod, were an unacclaimed act from the golden\
  \ age of variety theatre. Both dressed as middle-ranking police officers, they would\
  \ bound creakily on to the stage\u2014they were of advancing years\u2014Tad from\
  \ the right and Tod from the left or, as it might be, Tod from the right and Tad\
  \ from the left, and proceed to bludgeon each other about the head with their truncheons.\
  \ These were lead-weighted heavy rubber truncheons as deployed by real coppers.\
  \ One or other of them, Tad or Tod, would collapse unconscious to the floor first,\
  \ at which point the still-conscious-but-decidedly-woozy one, Tod or Tad, would\
  \ break into song, usually slurring the words due to the disorientation occasioned\
  \ by the several blows to the head received. The song itself never varied. A third,\
  \ non-performing brother, Gilliblat, wrote both the words and the music. The lyrics\
  \ were as follows:\nI bashed my brother on the head\n  But don't you worry, he's\
  \ not dead\n  We will be back tomorrow night\n  For another truncheon fight\n  We're\
  \ the Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod\n  And we bathe in the blood of the Lamb of\
  \ God\n  We take our baths offstage of course\n  Now please cheer us until you are\
  \ hoarse\n  We'll pass a cap round for your cash\n  Then I'll give Tod [or it might\
  \ be Tad] a final bash\nThe cap, passed around the audience by Gilliblat, rarely\
  \ had any cash in it by the time it came back to him, though the Truncheon Brothers\
  \ never wanted for buttons and corks and scrunched-up bits of paper.\nSource : Some\
