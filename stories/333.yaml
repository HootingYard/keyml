text: "One might think we had enough coms to be going on with. We already have sitcoms\
  \ and romcoms and divcoms and dotcoms\u2014respectively, situation comedies, romantic\
  \ comedies, The Divine Comedy by Dante, and comedies about dotterels, the small\
  \ wading bird of the plover family which breeds in the arctic tundra. So it might\
  \ be argued that yet another com is a com too many. Normally, I would agree, were\
  \ it not that the latest com is the frackcom, a series of comedies about Old Farmer\
  \ Frack. As these are chiefly written by the bestselling paperback author Pebblehead\
  \ I suppose they might equally well be called pebcoms. No doubt one or other term\
  \ will win out as the common usage, much as we say \u201Cping pong\u201D rather\
  \ than \u201Cgossima\u201D, and \u201Clawn tennis\u201D rather than \u201Csphairistike\u201D\
  .\nIt could be argued that there is little humour to be found in the perpetual trudgings\
  \ of a mad old farmer driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly,\
  \ in all weathers, through all the hours god sends. In fact, that is a view I have\
  \ myself favoured, as explicated thoroughly in my six-part television series Penitence\
  \ And Farm Implements, which insists that farmyard life is miserable and grim and\
  \ despondent and hateful and wretched and disgusting and absolutely without comic\
  \ possibility. But I reckoned without the skills of Pebblehead, whose hilarious\
  \ accounts of Old Farmer Frack driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly,\
  \ have me slapping my sides and gasping for breath.\nThe original books, of course,\
  \ are known as farmyardlit, and it is the films and TV series based upon them that\
  \ are called frackcoms or pebcoms. It is important to get this terminology right.\n\
