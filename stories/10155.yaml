text: "\nWhat kind of madness is it that would prompt a person to make up a duck?\
  \ This was a question I asked myself after consulting a list of fictional ducks\
  \ and discovering, with something akin to terror, that it contained over one hundred\
  \ and fifty non-existent ducks.\nLet us allow those words to penetrate. Over one\
  \ hundred and fifty non-existent ducks. That is no small number. Line them all up\
  \ in a row and it would take a while to walk from one end to the other. And imagine\
  \ the din if they all quacked at the same time! You would have to stuff your ears\
  \ with cotton wool. But of course, they cannot be lined up and they cannot quack,\
  \ because they do not exist and never have existed. They are wholly imaginary semi-aquatic\
  \ beings, born in the minds of flawed humanity.\nIt is not that the world lacks\
  \ real, flesh-and-feather-and-blood ducks. Go to any duckpond or lake and the chances\
  \ are you will see more than a few ducks. You might even toss them scraps of stale\
  \ bread from a brown paper bag if you are that way inclined. You might peer at distant\
  \ ducks through a pair of binoculars. But it is a far cry from such innocent pursuits\
  \ to unleash from within the throbbing jelly of your brain a made up duck. Yet clearly\
  \ that is what has happened in the past, with a number of people, though fewer than\
  \ a hundred and fifty. Tragically, some among these poor duck-haunted souls have\
  \ invented more than one fictional duck..\nYou would think that, having made up\
  \ a non-existent duck, the duck-maker would mop their brow and retire from the fray,\
  \ perhaps clear their head by going on a long hiking holiday in an area of few ponds\
  \ and fewer lakes. The last thing you would expect is that they would immediately\
  \ set about inventing another duck. But some have done just that. Now you see why\
  \ I used the word \u201Cmadness\u201D.\nOur difficulty lies in trying to grasp the\
  \ lineaments of a mentality that can spark the thought: \u201CThere are millions\
  \ of ducks in the world, but (and? so?) I am going to make up another one!\u201D\
  \ And not only to have the thought but to act upon it. Perhaps that is the crucial\
  \ distinction between mere eccentricity and full-blown madness. Casting back upon\
  \ my own mental history, I wonder if it has ever occurred to me to make up a duck.\
  \ I wonder, too, if that is a rather common thought, one shared by thousands if\
  \ not millions of persons past and present. Yet how few of us have taken the fateful\
  \ next step . . . the actual creation of a non-existent duck!\nThere is something\
  \ of the Frankenstein about it, is there not? Derangement, delusion, and mania all\
  \ focussed, horribly, on an id\xE9e fixe. But the duck-makers have no need of lightning-blasted\
  \ laboratories high in castles, nor of hunchbacked assistants named Mungo, nor of\
  \ the various paraphernalia ascribed to Victor Frankenstein in this or that recounting\
  \ of his blasphemous doings. To make up a duck, one may need merely a pencil, or\
  \ a typewriter, or some cloth accompanied by basic skills in needlework. That being\
  \ so, we must not lose sight of the fact that the same mad impulse is at work, in\
  \ both the crazed scientist and the creator of fictional ducks. It is an impulse\
  \ to tame or control nature, to play God.\nThis is nowhere more evident than in\
  \ the unnerving fact that the majority of fictional ducks are blessed (damned?)\
  \ with the gift of human speech. And just as I am quite clear in my use of the word\
  \ \u201Cmadness\u201D, so too with \u201Cunnerving\u201D. I suspect if you were\
  \ ever to come upon a real duck that, instead of quacking, spoke to you in a familiar\
  \ tongue, you would be unnerved. I dreamed of such a duck once, and I woke up screaming.\
  \ It was a hideous nightmare rather than a dream, but the important thing to state\
  \ here is that the talking duck was the sole source of my terror. Nothing else that\
  \ occurred in the night-phantasm was frightening, or gruesome, or unholy.\nThe scene\
  \ was unremarkable, even humdrum. I was in my childhood home, the house I grew up\
  \ in. My parents were there, peripherally, in that there was a sense of their presence.\
  \ I entered the living room, and sat in an armchair, and looked across, and there,\
  \ perched on the seat of the matching armchair, was a duck. It engaged me in conversation.\
  \ At first, I felt no sense of alarm. Dream-logic was at work, and all seemed well.\
  \ But as the duck continued to speak, its voice grew more grating and menacing,\
  \ and it spoke of things I shudder to recall. Slowly it dawned on me that it was\
  \ an evil duck, a Lucifer or Beelzebub duck, fathomless and awful in its pure unalloyed\
  \ malevolence. That is when I woke up screaming. It is a nightmare I have never\
  \ been able to forget.\nThat duck remains for me the epitome of all fictional ducks,\
  \ and it is why I cannot shake the feeling that every other non-existent duck aspires\
  \ to its state of sheer evil. Would that the makers of made up ducks take heed!\n\
  I have not mentioned, in the foregoing, a second category of fictional ducks, ones\
  \ far more numerous than the one hundred and fifty or so given in the list. These\
  \ are decoy ducks, usually carved from wood. Pinocchio-ducks, if you will. They\
  \ are even more terrifying than the non-existent ducks we have already considered,\
  \ but my nerves are shattered now, and I cannot bring myself to write about them\
  \ until I have eased my overheated brain. But give me time, and I shall summon up\
  \ the mental and moral resources to address the subject, and to explain why, whenever\
  \ you encounter a decoy duck, you should be very, very afraid.\n[2012-09-18]"
