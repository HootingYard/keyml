text: "Astute readers will note that posts currently appear undated and without a\
  \ comment option. This is due to one of those laughably-named \u201Cupgrades\u201D\
  , which as far as I can see just make life more difficult. Fear not, equilibrium\
  \ will be restored as soon as possible. I will be wittering about this in due course\
  \ (i.e., in approximately fifty years time).\nUPDATE\_: Dates and Comments restored,\
  \ as you can see. The Yard's boffin is working on further tweaks to tidy up the\
  \ spacing between posts and a few other horrors.\nUPDATE UPDATE\_: Back to normal.\
  \ I suppose I could delete this post, but I will leave it here for the historical\
  \ record, to be pored over by future scholars. Also, leaving it here means I can\
  \ continue to assert that there has been at least one posting every day since the\
  \ sixteenth of December last year, which makes a change from the awful hiatuses\
  \ (hiatae?) of yore.\n[2009-02-11]"
