text: "The heavy bear who goes with me, a manifold honey to smear his face, clumsy\
  \ and lumbering here and there, I wish I could say what kind of bear he is. Others,\
  \ no doubt, could tell you, but I am afraid I am a trembling bundle of ursine ignorance.\
  \ I have no idea which pigeonhole to put this bear into.\nWhat I do know is that\
  \ I am wholly responsible for it. I know this because the bear came to me in a dream,\
  \ and in dreams begin responsibilities. It was a vivid dream, perhaps because, shortly\
  \ before resting my head on the pillow, I had tucked into an enormous sandwich in\
  \ which many a pickle had been inserted, pickles of all kinds. I know more about\
  \ pickles than I do about bears, but this is neither the time nor the place for\
  \ pickle matters.\nIn my dream, I think it was the year 1909, and I felt as if I\
  \ were in a motion picture theatre, the long arm of light crossing the darkness\
  \ and spinning, my eyes fixed on the screen. It was a silent picture, as if an old\
  \ Biograph one, in which the actors are dressed in ridiculously old-fashioned clothes,\
  \ and one flash succeeds another with sudden jumps. The actors too seem to jump\
  \ about and walk too fast. The shots themselves are full of dots and rays, as if\
  \ it were raining when the pictures were photographed. The light is bad. It was\
  \ that kind of film.\nSuddenly, among all these jumping actors, lumbered into view\
  \ the heavy bear, the central ton of every place, the hungry beating brutish one\
  \ in love with candy, anger, and sleep. Our eyes met, and I felt\u2014oh so vividly\u2014\
  that from now on, until one of us died, this bear was my responsibility. Which is\
  \ all very well in the world of dreams, but gave me something of a start when I\
  \ woke up and found the bear, all too heavy and solid and, good heavens!, real,\
  \ slumped at the foot of my bed.\nI squeaked in fear, but soon enough learned there\
  \ was nothing to be frightened of. It is a very placid bear, all things considered,\
  \ except for those times when it is dishevelling all and climbing buildings and\
  \ kicking footballs and boxing its brother bears in the hate-filled city. But it\
  \ has never laid a paw on me. Indeed, it seems to take great pains to be helpful,\
  \ acting like a crazy factotum.\nIt has proved to be an interesting few weeks, getting\
  \ used to having my every footstep dogged by a heavy bear. It has certainly caused\
  \ a bit of a rumpus in social situations, and on public transport. It had never\
  \ before occurred to me that bears were not welcome on buses. Given the behaviour\
  \ of a number of human passengers, this seems a huge injustice. I have tried to\
  \ explain to bus drivers that the bear is my responsibility, and goes with me everywhere,\
  \ but they are not willing to listen. So we have done a heck of a lot of walking,\
  \ me and my bear, up hill and down dale and along all those lanes that the buses\
  \ ply.\nI am so tired at the end of each day that I have sworn off pickle sandwiches,\
  \ but I still find it hard to sleep. This is because, breathing at my side, that\
  \ heavy animal, that heavy bear who sleeps with me, howls in his sleep for a world\
  \ of sugar. This despite the fact that I have made a complete change to my breakfast\u2014\
  or, as our Flemish pals call it, het ontbijt\u2014diet. No more eggs and sausages\
  \ and smokers\u2019 poptarts for me! I have been buying enormous quantities of Sugar\
  \ Puffs, dozens of cartons at a time. For those of you unfamiliar with British breakfast\
  \ cereal brands, Sugar Puffs are made from sugar-coated wheat flavoured with honey,\
  \ by the Quaker Oats company. My bear seems to like them, and in fact it has been\
  \ feeding on Sugar Puffs for lunch and dinner and supper as well as breakfast. But\
  \ it still howls in its sleep. And it is getting heavier.\nI am stuck with my bear,\
  \ and I am not complaining. But I noticed in the paper the other day that the local\
  \ fleapit has a screening next week of an old Biograph motion picture called Actors\
  \ In Ridiculously Old-Fashioned Clothes, Jumping About And Walking Too Fast In Dots\
  \ And Rays, With A Bear! (Horst Gack, 1909). I wonder what will happen to my bear\
  \ when it sees itself up on the screen. It came to me in a dream. Will it abandon\
  \ me when it sees the dream? Will it take responsibility for itself, and find its\
  \ own Sugar Puffs? I will let you know.\n[With apologies to Delmore Schwartz.]\n\
