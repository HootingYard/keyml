text: "Once upon a time Dobson decided to write a pamphlet on the subject of lint.\n\
  Thus begins Ted Cack's mammoth new book The Lint Pamphlet\_: An Enduring Mystery.\
  \ It is the latest in a series of mammoth books, each one devoted to a single work\
  \ by Dobson, including those which the twentieth century's titanic pamphleteer abandoned,\
  \ or planned but never wrote, or were mere fugitive throbs within his cranium.\n\
  \u201CBy the time my work is done\u201D, announced Ted Cack at a press conference\
  \ held at the end of a dilapidated seaside pier, buffeted by squalls, earlier this\
  \ week, \u201CThe number of words I will have devoted to Dobson's works will dwarf\
  \ the number of words in all those works put together, however you add them up.\u201D\
  \nQuite what he meant by this last phrase is unclear, as there is only one way to\
  \ add things up, as most of us understand the process. Granted, we are not all students\
  \ of advanced mathematics, but then nor is Ted Cack. His profile on the online network\
  \ MyBoast lists several qualifications from several dubious or unimportant institutions,\
  \ most of which appear to be in frankly absurd fields such as Hermeneutic Ornithology\
  \ or Unapplied Faffing.\nAs a Dobsonist, however, Ted Cack is peerless. Once the\
  \ hot-headed enfant terrible of Dobson studies, as the years have passed his head\
  \ has become far less hot. Indeed, last time its temperature was measured, his head\
  \ proved to be so cold various medics pronounced him clinically dead. Ted Cack shocked\
  \ them all by springing up from his head-temperatutre-measuring-bed, cutting two\
  \ or three capers around the room \xE0 la James Boswell of a morning, dancing either\
  \ a quadrille or a gavotte depending from what angle you viewed it, and singing,\
  \ with unnerving boisterousness, the chorus from \u201CMore Than A Feeling\u201D\
  \ by Boston (Scholz, 1976).\nI'm afraid I must interrupt this riveting narrative.\
  \ The console is beeping with an incoming query. Let me decode it.\nQ\u2014If Ted\
  \ Cack is peerless, how do you explain his press conference taking place on a pier,\
  \ albeit a dilapidated one?\nThe question is more sensible than it seems, much,\
  \ much more sensible, so sensible it takes my breath away (Moroder/Whitlock, 1986;\
  \ performed by Berlin. Berlin ought not be confused with Irving Berlin. The former\
  \ was an American New Wave band formed in Orange County, home of Richard M. Nixon,\
  \ in 1979. The latter, born Israel Beilin, wrote the kinds of songs which would\
  \ knock anything written by the band into a cocked hat.)\nMy breath having been\
  \ taken away, I am unable to answer the question right now, but can only pant and\
  \ wheeze as I struggle to remain conscious. You may be familiar with such a struggle,\
  \ for example when listening to Hooting Yard On The Air, broadcasts of which have\
  \ been known to lull even the most alert listeners into a deep and profound sleep,\
  \ or at least a catnap.\nI should point out here that enquiries, such as the one\
  \ about peerless Ted Cack on a pier, are always welcome, even if I do not always\u2014\
  oh, wait, here is another one beeping on the console already!\nQ\u2014I could not\
  \ help noticing that you have mentioned two pop music combos today, both of which\
  \ take their names from cities beginning with the letter B, that is, Boston and\
  \ Berlin. Are there any other groups with similar nomenclature, for example Bridlington,\
  \ Basingstoke, Biggleswade, Bognor Regis, Broadstairs, Budleigh Salterton, or Bungay,\
  \ to list only a few towns in England?\nIf anything, this is an even more sensible\
  \ question, and one I would be prepared to answer here and now were my knowledge\
  \ of pop music combos more exhaustive than it is, but for heaven's sake, I'm meant\
  \ to be talking about lint!\n\u201CPerhaps the most startling revelation of my mammoth\
  \ new book\u201D, said Ted Cack at that press conference held at the end of a dilapidated\
  \ seaside pier, buffeted by squalls, earlier this week, \u201Cis that Dobson seemed\
  \ to be wholly ignorant about his proposed subject matter.\u201D\nThis is not half\
  \ as startling as Ted Cack thinks it is. It was the out of print pamphleteer's common\
  \ practice to write endless screeds on topics of which he knew nothing whatsoever.\
  \ The word for this is perpilocution, and Dobson was a master of it. Sometimes he\
  \ liked to pretend he was following the dictum that the best way to learn about\
  \ something is to write a book about it, but this is rather belied by the resulting\
  \ out of print pamphlets, which rarely tell us much about anything except the baffling\
  \ innards of the author's brain.\nStartling or not, however, Ted Cack paints a compelling\
  \ picture of Dobson and Marigold Chew at breakfast on the morning when the lint\
  \ spark was lit. The couple were tucking into bowls of reconstituted partridge livers\
  \ in a mustard \u2018n\u2019 milk of magnesia froideur\_when the pamphleteer suddenly\
  \ banged his spoon against his forehead and burst into unnervingly boisterous song.\n\
  \u201CI want to know what lint is. I want you to show me, Marigold my sweet. I want\
  \ to feel what lint is. I know you can show me.\u201D\u201D\nHe sang to the tune\
  \ of \u201CI Want To Know What Love Is\u201D (Jones, 1984; performed by Foreigner.\
  \ Interestingly, all the members of the group actually were foreigners, except for\
  \ those periods when they were present in their home countries.)\n\u201CI think\
  \ you had better write a pamphlet on the subject, Dobson\u201D, said Marigold Chew.\n\
  The \u201Cenduring mystery\u201D of Ted Cack's subtitle is that Dobson never did.\n\
