text: "On Thursday last, while trotting through the park, the parson was unhorsed,\
  \ and fell into a ha-ha. Torrential rainfall during the previous week had filled\
  \ the ditch with puddles, and when he clambered out, the parson was sopping wet.\
  \ His horse had galloped away, and was nowhere to be seen, so the parson faced the\
  \ prospect of having to walk the many miles back to his parsonage. The weather remained\
  \ inclement, although it was no longer raining.\nAt this juncture, the parson felt\
  \ the presence of the uncanny, just behind him. He span around, and saw an angel.\
  \ Its wings were furled, its locks were golden. In one hand, it held a jar of mayonnaise,\
  \ in the other a bottle of bleach. The parson was surprised to note that it wore\
  \ black leather gloves.\n\u201CTake this jar and take this bottle,\u201D said the\
  \ angel. So mellifluous was its voice that the parson near swooned. He reached out,\
  \ and took the mayonnaise and the bleach, and as soon as he did so, the angel vanished.\
  \ Where it had stood there was a haze of gaseous mist. The parson was sore perplexed.\n\
  Just then, as astronomers had foretold, there was a partial eclipse of the sun and,\
  \ as seismologists had foretold, a minor earthquake shook the ground on which the\
  \ parson stood. He nearly toppled over, and would have fallen back into the ha-ha,\
  \ and possibly smashed the jar and the bottle, both of which were glass, but he\
  \ was a parson \_of stupendous balance. All the more surprising that he had been\
  \ unhorsed.\nThe partial eclipse made the park dark. But in its jar, the mayonnaise\
  \ had a creamy glow. The parson held it aloft, and it lit him on his way as he began\
  \ his long journey home.\n\nHaving read the piece aloud to your class, posit the\
  \ following questions. Allow the time indicated in each case for the tinies to scratch\
  \ the answers upon their slates.\nWhy do you think the parson was unhorsed? (30\
  \ seconds)\nWhat kind of angel would wear gloves? (30 seconds)\nHow likely is it\
  \ that an eclipse and an earthquake would happen at the same time? (15 seconds)\n\
  Why did the angel present the parson with a bottle of bleach? (90 seconds)\nDo you\
  \ think the horse found its own way back to the parsonage? (30 seconds)\nOf which\
  \ noble gases would the haze of mist be composed? (120 seconds)\nNow get the class\
  \ to retell the story in such a way that the parson and the angel and the horse\
  \ all swap r\xF4les. (6 hours)\n[2011-03-10]"
