text: "I failed to mention, in yesterday's essay about his love song, that Ah-Fang\
  \ Van Der Houygendorp was a mountaineer. So let me put that right without further\
  \ ado. Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp was a mountaineer, a noted mountaineer. Elsewhere,\
  \ I wrote of him that \u201CPhysically, [he] was not really cut out for mountaineering.\
  \ He was described by a contemporary as \u2018a figure of untold puniness\u2019\
  , and he was indeed tiny and weak, short-sighted, lanky and prone to swooning fits.\
  \ He was terrified of gnats, horseflies and fruitbats. He had an oversensitive digestive\
  \ system and had to subsist mostly on thin soup or broth. It was difficult to find\
  \ a mountaineering team willing to recruit so wretched a specimen, so Ah-Fang did\
  \ most of his clambering up sheer rock faces solo, a man alone testing himself against\
  \ the elements\u201D.\nThis description was called into question by Brian Phantasm,\
  \ who took me to task in the pages of Puny Mountaineers Monthly, accusing me of\
  \ getting my Ah-Fangs mixed up. As if! There were not exactly dozens of Ah-Fang\
  \ Van Der Houygendorps who were accomplished mountaineers, in love with Mrs Gubbins,\
  \ and perished in the Hindenburg disaster. Granted, there may have been a couple\
  \ of others, but\u2014tellingly\u2014Mr Phantasm\u2014sorry, Doctor Phantasm\u2014\
  though what he is a doctor of God alone knows\u2014the doctoring of signatures on\
  \ counterfeit documents, probably\u2014um\u2014I think I have lost my thread. Let\
  \ me begin that sentence again. Granted, there may have been a couple of other Ah-Fang\
  \ Van Der Houygendorps who met the necessary criteria, but\u2014tellingly\u2014\
  Doctor Phantasm does not identify the one he accuses me of getting mixed up with\
  \ the Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp I was writing about. I hope that is clear. I am\
  \ becoming somewhat befuddled in defending myself against these outrageous charges,\
  \ and outrageous they are, as is Doctor Phantasm's dress sense, but it is best to\
  \ cast a veil over that, and a very thick veil, made of many blankets, as if he\
  \ were a prisoner being ushered between police car and police station, covered to\
  \ outwit the press photographers. It is my fond hope that one day Phantasm himself\
  \ will be placed under arrest, and then he might stop attacking me in the pages\
  \ of little-read magazines.\nOur initial falling out, some years ago, was occasioned\
  \ by a piece he wrote in News Of The Screes, a small circulation mountaineering\
  \ journal devoted, as its title suggests, to scree, the accumulation of broken rock\
  \ fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs, or valley shoulders. It was an\
  \ ill-written and intemperate rant, the gist of which, when one got past the swearwords,\
  \ was that the word \u201Cscree\u201D should be dropped and replaced by \u201Ctalus\u201D\
  , which means the same thing and has become the scientifically-approved term. \u201C\
  Scree\u201D is of Old Norse origin, whereas \u201Ctalus\u201D derives from French.\
  \ Now, I am neither Norse nor French, and Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp was Sino-Dutch,\
  \ so my championing of \u201Cscree\u201D is not based on any infantile sense of\
  \ chauvinism. But champion \u201Cscree\u201D I do, without apology, in all weathers.\
  \ It is clearly the more apposite word for the accumulation of broken rock fragments\
  \ at the base of crags, mountain cliffs, or valley shoulders which serves as its\
  \ definition. Go to a scree and have a go at clambering across it if you don't believe\
  \ me. Better, be there when tumbling rock fragments from the upper slopes come crashing\
  \ down to add to the scree, and raise the earflaps of your mountaineering hat to\
  \ listen carefully. I am sure you will agree that \u201Cscree\u201D beats \u201C\
  talus\u201D hands down, whatever our French amis and scientists might say on the\
  \ matter.\nI wrote a letter to the editor of News Of The Screes, arguing my point\
  \ and suggesting that Doctor Phantasm was an oaf and a dunderpate and probably a\
  \ forger of doctored signatures on important documents. Thus our war of words began,\
  \ and it continues to this day. So when he writes to accuse me of mixing up my Ah-Fangs,\
  \ I swat his article aside as I might swat one of the gnats Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp\
  \ was so affrighted by. That is my Ah-Fang, of course, not one of Brian Phantasm's\
  \ putative unidentified Ah-Fangs.\nMy Ah-Fang spent much of his mountaineering time\
  \ clambering across scree. His puniness was such that he often grew exhausted, panting,\
  \ panting, panting, while barely across the scree, whatever the steepness or otherwise\
  \ of its gradient. For remember that some scree is steeper than other scree, depending\
  \ on its geographical location and indeed the circumstances of its geological formation,\
  \ whether created by dint of mechanical weathering by ice, chemical weathering by\
  \ mineral hydration and salt deposition, thermal stresses, topographic stresses,\
  \ or biotic processes. [Note to self: make a study of the word \u201Cdint\u201D\
  .] Sometimes Ah-Fang was so puffed out from clambering over a mere few yards of\
  \ scree that he collapsed upon it, gazing hopelessly upwards to where the summit\
  \ he aimed to ascend vanished in the clouds. Could there be a more pitiable image\
  \ of a mountaineer?\nBut we must bear in mind that some scree can prove to be devilishly\
  \ difficult terrain. All those rock fragments, often loose, can be perilous, even\
  \ when one is not puny. So let us not mock Ah-Fang, or rather his memory, as the\
  \ despicable and quite probably criminal Brian Phantasm has done in his latest piece\
  \ of grievous folderol. No fewer than ten pages of last week's issue of Screeds\
  \ On Scree were given over to a disgraceful rewriting of history, in which Phantasm\
  \ claims that Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp used stilts and some kind of anti-panting\
  \ elixir to cross the scree at the foot of Big Oddly-Shaped Mountain Number Seven\
  \ in 1929, one of his most famous ascents, and the one for which he was awarded\
  \ a medal\u2014the very medal I snapped up at an auction of Ah-Fang memorabilia\
  \ which was then stolen from me by a footpad who bore a striking resemblance to\
  \ Brian Phantasm. I have no proof, and I have never knowingly met this hellhound,\
  \ but my assailant had a bouffant and cummerbund and winklepickers identical to\
  \ those sported by Phantasm in the one grainy black and white photograph of him\
  \ that I have seen, a copy of which I keep pasted in my Enemies Book (page 149,\
  \ lavender series).\nAnd so once again I must take up my butcher's pencil to rebut,\
  \ or refute, I can't remember which, the calumnies rained down upon Ah-Fang. But\
  \ I will continue to defend his memory until the cows come home. And no, they are\
  \ not coming home now, o'er the rain-soaked loam.\n[2012-01-31]"
