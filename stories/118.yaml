text: "Before plunging into the ocean, snorkelled and flippered or, as it may be,\
  \ encased in full body diving gear, it is critically important that you are aware\
  \ of the actual size of the innumerable life forms that teem within the vasty deep.\
  \ If you have read Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Neurasthenic Aquaperson,\
  \ you will appreciate the force of my argument. In this book, the author ploughs\
  \ through a relentless litany of aquatic diving enthusiasts of a nervous disposition\
  \ who came a-cropper in the water because they feared an encounter with some monstrous\
  \ sea-being whose picture they had pored over in an album of marine life, without\
  \ having taken care to read a parenthetical addendum to the caption saying (actual\
  \ size) or (not to scale).\nFor the hearty and the reckless, of course, there is\
  \ no problem. They will topple off the side of their boat and go happily splashing\
  \ about in the depths with the same gusto they would take to striding across a wild\
  \ and desolate moor, or tucking into breakfast in a magnificent hotel dining room.\
  \ But woe betide the mentally fragile diving person, one who suffers from attacks\
  \ of the vapours, should they jump into the broiling ocean unprepared!\nLet us consider\
  \ an example. Here is a picture of Zoanthus socialis:\n\nIn reality, this is a tiny\
  \ thing, much magnified in our reproduction, and threatens no peril to the average-sized\
  \ human diver, whether hearty or neurasthenic. Yet the latter, those whose brains\
  \ are given to fuming imaginings based upon anatomical inaccuracy, may have understood\
  \ these wee creatures to be titanic in size. They may fear being sucked into Zoanthus\
  \ socialis\u2019 hideous maw, helpless and alone. Such timidity in the sea is desperately\
  \ bad for the moral fibre.\nPebblehead acknowledges that many nerve-wracked oceanic\
  \ explorers will prepare themselves by swallowing a draught of some brain tonic\
  \ or emboldening potion before clambering into their wetsuit. He condemns this practice,\
  \ rightly in my view, in prose of towering vigour. \u201CThere can be no substitute,\u201D\
  \ he writes, \u201Cfor preceding each dive into the squalid black depths of the\
  \ oceans with untold hours of study of the actual size of thousands, nay, millions\
  \ of grotesque life forms that populate those very same squalid black depths into\
  \ which the neurasthenic aquaperson is due to plunge!\u201D\nSome cynics have pointed\
  \ out that Pebblehead has a vested interest. He owns the rights to a patented mechanism\
  \ by which the prospective diving person is able to stand before a full-length mirror\
  \ and watch as, one after another, actual size images of numberless sea-beings are\
  \ superimposed upon his or her body. An accompanying set of tomes contains colour\
  \ plates of each creature, fully captioned in English and Latin, which can be consulted\
  \ during the slide show, or separately. This seems to me to be a wholly admirable\
  \ enterprise, and it is no skin off my nose if it earns Pebblehead a fortune. Indeed,\
  \ one might ask what comparable service to humanity, neurasthenic or otherwise,\
  \ is being provided by other bestselling paperback authors. Perhaps I am being unfair\
  \ to the likes of Andy McNab, Barbara Taylor Bradford, and Martin Amis, but where\
  \ oh where are their initiatives to give succour and hope to jangle-brained aquapersons,\
  \ pig farmers, posties, stamp collectors, bellringers, detectives, pie shop proprietors,\
  \ and conquistadors? Pebblehead deserves a medal, or at least a tin cup, and I for\
  \ one will happily campaign on his behalf. I shall be outside the town hall with\
  \ a placard and a flask of tea at six o clock tomorrow morning, and every morning.\
  \ Join me.\n[2007-03-14]"
