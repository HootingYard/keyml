text: "Many thanks to David Thompson for bringing to our attention this letter from\
  \ the correspondence columns of the Weekly Worker. What a relief to know that David\
  \ Icke's sensible insights have been taken on board by the Communist Party Alliance!\n\
  I never claimed that the future of humanity \u201Cmay rest on the beneficence of\
  \ extra-terrestrial reptiles.\u201D I\u2026 referred to the reptilian control theory,\
  \ which argues that for thousands of years humanity has been controlled by a reptilian\
  \ race, using their mixed reptile-human genetic bloodlines, who have oppressed and\
  \ exploited humans, while claiming descent from the \u2018gods\u2019 and the divine\
  \ right to rule by bloodline. Ancient and modern society is obsessed with reptilian,\
  \ serpent and dragon themes, possibly due to this heritage. Even the flag of Wales\
  \ has a dragon on it.\nMost people have closed minds, depending on the issues. Mention\
  \ the possibility of aliens secretly manipulating humanity behind the scenes and\
  \ the shutters come down.\n[2015-02-21]"
