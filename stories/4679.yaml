text: "Within minutes of beginning my research into the poultry yards of archdukes,\
  \ I struck gold. I suppose I should not have been surprised to learn that it was\
  \ a topic to which Dobson had turned his attention, in his pamphlet The Poultry\
  \ Yards Of The Grand Archdukes (out of print). Alackaday!, as Hadrian Beverland\
  \ would put it, I then struck base metal, for it turns out that this is one of the\
  \ rarest of the rare of Dobson pamphlets, and I could not get my hands on a copy\
  \ try as I might, not that I tried very hard, having other things on my mind, such\
  \ as Pantsil's performance in the World Cup, guff, pomposity, and potato crisps.\
  \ Of which, more later, if it please your Lordship.\nNow the unobtainability of\
  \ a pamphlet would deal a knockout blow to a weedy, milksop researcher, but I am\
  \ made of sterner stuff. I gulped down a beaker of Squelcho! and, at dead of night,\
  \ I stole out to the weird woods of Woohoohoodiwoo and sought out the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman. I found her crouching in a patch of nettles, moving her withered arms in\
  \ some incomprehensible but no doubt eldritch fashion, and muttering gibberish.\
  \ Good old Woohoohoodiwoo Woman!, I thought, she never lets you down. Not, at least,\
  \ if you remember to bring her a gift, as I did. I greeted her and handed over a\
  \ rather smudged back number of the Reader's Digest. I had no idea to what weird\
  \ and spooky use she would put it, but it is better not to ask. She gave the magazine\
  \ a couple of gummy bites to make sure it was genuine, and then asked me, in her\
  \ weird woohoohoodiwoo voice, what I wanted. I cleared my throat.\n\u201CAre you\
  \ familiar with the out of print pamphleteer Dobson?\u201D I asked her. When I spoke\
  \ aloud the great man's name, an owl hooted and a wolf howled. The Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman's head moved slightly, in what might have been a nod. It was either that\
  \ or a magical spasm. I pressed on.\n\u201CThere is an unobtainable pamphlet by\
  \ Dobson which I feel impelled to read, oh Woman of Woohoohoodiwoo,\u201D I continued,\
  \ \u201CAnd I was wondering if, through your tremendously strange powers, you might\
  \ be able to commune with transient shimmerings of ectoplasmic doo-dah and somehow\
  \ have transmitted to you the full text of this pamphlet, entitled The Poultry Yards\
  \ Of The Grand Archdukes, and declaim it to me, here in the weird woods in moonlight,\
  \ while I scribble down what you say in my notepad with my propelling pencil.\u201D\
  \ I patted my pocket to indicate that I had come prepared with these essential items.\n\
  The Woohoohoodiwoo Woman did some business with a toad and a newt and a hacksaw\
  \ and some parsley and the bleached and boiled skull of a starling and a handful\
  \ of breadcrumbs, and there was a mighty flash of eerie incandescence across the\
  \ sky and a boom as of thunder and then she began to writhe in hideous jarring contortions\
  \ as the night air grew chill as the grave. Then she began to babble, and I started\
  \ scribbling.\nWhen we were done, I patted the Weird Woman on her weird head, promised\
  \ her further back copies of the Reader's Digest or Carp Talk!, her other favourite\
  \ periodical, and headed for home clutching the precious recovered text. I had a\
  \ long day's work ahead of me, transcribing the scribble in my notepad using my\
  \ iWoo, a fantastic new device from Apple specifically designed for the transcription\
  \ of unearthly hallucinatory babblings into tough sensible prose. I chuckled to\
  \ myself, wondering what Dobson would have made of our twenty-first century technology.\
  \ Somehow I could not imagine the great man Twittering or Facebooking or posting\
  \ videos on YouTube, though there is of course that tantalising paragraph in his\
  \ pamphlet Tantalising Paragraphs About The World O\u2019 The Future (out of print)\
  \ where he seems to be hinting at some kind of hand-held apparatus called an iRuskin.\
  \ I must look it up and parlay my observations into a postage here one of these\
  \ days.\nAs soon as I got home, just after dawn, I switched on or, as they say nowadays,\
  \ powered up my iWoo, and left it to bleep and hum while I fixed a solid breakfast.\
  \ This involved more eggs than you can shake a stick at, which is a goodly number\
  \ of eggs, I can tell you. This is my own breakfast recipe, called Hitchcock's Nightmare,\
  \ or, alternatively, Orwell's Glut. All of my many and various breakfast recipes\
  \ are named after writers, painters, and film directors, and I hope one day to cobble\
  \ them together into a compendium. But a more urgent task was at hand. What, I wondered,\
  \ had Dobson had to say about the poultry yards of the grand archdukes in that rare,\
  \ o rare!, pamphlet?\nThe iWoo hissed and juddered like some living organism as\
  \ it tackled the bonkers babbling of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, but before sunset\
  \ I had a print-out. It ran to forty pages of densely-set text, cleverly imitating\
  \ the authentic look of a Gestetnered pamphlet direct from Marigold Chew's shed.\
  \ I was too exhausted to read it then and there, so I shoved it into a drawer and\
  \ went to bed.\nDuring the night I had that dream about the Kibbo Kift again.\n\
  The next morning, after a breakfast I call a Claude Chabrol Special, I sat down\
  \ to read. I was careful to bear in mind that what I was reading was not Dobson\
  \ as such, but Dobson as filtered through the eerie inexplicable powers of the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman, a different text entirely. Nonetheless, it was the nearest I could get\
  \ to the pamphleteer's own words.\nDobson, or the WooDobson, began by listing the\
  \ grand archdukes whose poultry yards he had studied. It was an incredibly long\
  \ and tedious list, packed with Ludwigs and Viggos and Hohenhohens and Gothengeists\
  \ and Ulrics and Umbertos. Here and there, a few biographical or historical details\
  \ were scattered about, but nothing about poultry yards nor, indeed, disgusting\
  \ rabbits. Next came one of those Dobsonian digressions, sometimes fascinating,\
  \ sometimes infuriating. This one was firmly in the latter camp, being an extended\
  \ meditation upon stars and yeast, neither of which topics the pamphleteer seemed\
  \ to have a clue about. By the time he had finished wittering, I was halfway through\
  \ the recovered pamphlet, and still waiting to learn about its ostensible subject\
  \ matter. I began to wonder if the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman had played a joke on me.\
  \ Had she really been in contact with ectoplasmic beings from a realm beyond our\
  \ puny understanding, or was she just raving? I wanted to trust her, not least because\
  \ I had paid good money for that back number of the Reader's Digest from Old Ma\
  \ Purgative's Anti-Communist Secondhand Periodicals Shoppe.\nBut of course I need\
  \ not have worried. After some closing flimflam about boiled yeast, the WooDobson\
  \ at last got to the matter in hand. Here was the sentence that made me sit bolt\
  \ upright:\nIt is patently obvious to anyone who has studied these things that all\
  \ grand archdukes, maintaining poultry yards upon their estates around which disgusting\
  \ rabbits prowled, did so because of a fanatical devotion to the cause of Unreason.\n\
  He goes on to explain. Unfortunately, this is where the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman's channels\
  \ of communication with the mysterious realms seem to have broken down a tad.\n\
  I say \u201Cpatently obvious\u201D because it is both patent and obvious. Consider\
  \ the Ancien Regime. Consider it again. Imagine yourself strutting about the corridors\
  \ of the archducal palace. Is your path blocked by hens? It is! Why are the hens\
  \ not in their coop in the poultry yard? Hear them clucking. If you could translate\
  \ their clucking into human speech, specifically High Germanic speech, as spoken\
  \ by quite a number of grand archdukes, what do you think they would be saying?\
  \ \u201CEek! Eek! We are in fear of the disgusting rabbits who skulk about the perimeter\
  \ of our yard!\u201D You might argue that rabbits are one of the last animals on\
  \ earth whose method of propelling themselves hither and thither could be described\
  \ as \u201Cskulking\u201D. You might argue that, but do you want to be seen arguing\
  \ with hens, in your palace corridor, by one of your footmen or valets? \u201CHo\
  \ ho ho\u201D, they would sneer, your minions, later, downstairs in their pantry,\
  \ \u201CThe old fool was arguing with hens. Who ever heard of such a thing?\u201D\
  \ Thereafter they would treat you with contempt and even come to question your Archdukedom.\
  \ The lettered ones among them might start reading insurrectionist pamphlets produced\
  \ by beardy German revolutionaries. Better by far never to argue with hens in the\
  \ corridor, no matter how panic-stricken they appear. Gather them up, one by one,\
  \ and put them right back in their coop, in the poultry yard. Send a rider to dash\
  \ on horseback to the Landgrave, in his distant fastness, to alert him to the presence\
  \ of disgusting rabbits. His forces may sweep in, within days or weeks, or not at\
  \ all, for you can never second guess the Landgrave. He has his own hens, in his\
  \ own poultry yard, where he argues with them all day long, for much interbreeding\
  \ in his noble line has made him soft in the head. See him dribble. See him drool.\
  \ See him argue frantically with this hen and that hen, hauling himself around the\
  \ poultry yard on the crutches which support his withered legs. The legs of his\
  \ hens are withered too, as are the legs of the disgusting rabbits who surround\
  \ his castle, yes, he has his own disgusting rabbits to contend with, as do all\
  \ Landgraves and Margraves and Grand Archdukes in the Ancien Regime, you would do\
  \ well to learn that and to cease your whining. Strut your corridors as you may,\
  \ for one day all will crumble, the footmen and valets will break out of the pantry\
  \ and run amuck, and there will be traffic between the terrified hens and the disgusting\
  \ rabbits, oh, odious, odious, but now you have glimpsed what is to come you must\
  \ be a fierce and ruthless Grand Archduke, in all your finery, though it fray to\
  \ tatters..\nI will leave it to the experts to judge if this is the authentic voice\
  \ of Dobson, or the witless prattle of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. Either way, it\
  \ takes us some way towards a better understanding of the Hens of Unreason, and\
  \ that is all we set out to do, in our modest way, on this summer's day.\n[2010-07-01]"
