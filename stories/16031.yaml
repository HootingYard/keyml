text: "Those who grew up in Sibodnedwabshire are forever haunted by memories of its\
  \ piggeries, in the shadow of those Blue Forgotten Hills. The hills may be\u2014\
  oh mercifully!\u2014forgotten, but the piggeries are not. Consider the song, still\
  \ sung, or croaked, by aged decrepit Sibodnedwabshireites in the cobwebbed rumpus\
  \ rooms of their hospices:\nThe hopes and fears of all the years\nThe cutman with\
  \ his rusty shears\nThe orphans wet behind the ears\nOh swine of Sibodnedwabshire\n\
  It is not a pretty song.\nThere were a dozen piggeries in all, each penning dozens\
  \ of pigs, except for the one that was empty of pigs, the one everybody remembers\
  \ with a shudder, its piglessness both eerie and ridiculous. There was mud there,\
  \ of course, mud aplenty, but not a single pig to wallow in it. The only things\
  \ living in that mud were worms, tiny wriggling albino worms, worms from a child's\
  \ nightmare.\nWormy nightmares, but piggy dreams. So many dreamers dreaming of those\
  \ remembered pigs in the piggeries that there is now a clinical term\u2014PTSD,\
  \ or Pig-Themed Sibodnedwabshire Dreaming. In their dotage now, those who were long\
  \ long ago the tots of Sibodnedwabshire have their hospice pillows embroidered with\
  \ pig motifs, the better to prompt their dreams.\nWhat of the cutman, with his rusty\
  \ shears? He would fly in, over the Blue Forgotten Hills, every Sunday, in his biplane,\
  \ and come into land at the aerodrome. Accompanied by the Shire Stymonsieur, he\
  \ would tour the twelve piggeries, yes, even that eerie and ridiculous pigless piggery,\
  \ bandying his shears, encrusted with rust, and singing his song.\nI am the cutman,\
  \ come to the shire\nMy heart as hot as an Elmo fire\nTurning and turning in the\
  \ widening gyre\nOh swine of Sibodnedwabshire\nIt was not a pretty song.\n[2017-12-03]"
