text: "Further to that earwig business, I found this reference to Speke and earwigs\
  \ at snopes.com:\nJohn Hanning Speke, remembered for tracking down the source of\
  \ the Nile River, recorded that the interior of his tent \u201Cbecame covered with\
  \ a host of small black beetles, evidently attracted by the glimmer of the candle.\u201D\
  \ Exhausted, Speke went to sleep with them crawling over his person, only to be\
  \ awakened by one of the \u201Chorrid little insects\u201D struggling into his ear.\
  \ Trying to remove the beetle only pushed it in further. The beetle continued into\
  \ Speke's ear as far as possible, and then \u201Che began with exceeding vigour\
  \ like a rabbit in a hole, to dig violently away at my tympanum. The queer sensation\
  \ this amusing measure excited in me is past description . . . What to do I knew\
  \ not.\u201D After trying to flush the critter out with melted butter, Speke tried\
  \ to dig it out with his penknife, succeeding only in killing it and increasing\
  \ the damage to his ear. Infection followed, distorting his face and causing boils.\
  \ \u201CFor many months the tumour made me almost deaf, and ate a hole between the\
  \ ear and the nose, so that when I blew it, my ear whistled so audibly that those\
  \ who heard it laughed. Six or seven months after this accident happened, bits of\
  \ the beetle\u2014a leg, a wing, or parts of the body\u2014came away in the wax.\u201D\
  \n(Quotes are from Speke's journals, as referred to in Captain Sir Richard Francis\
  \ Burton by Edward Rice, 1990, Scribner's, New York.)\n[2012-07-16]"
