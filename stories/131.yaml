text: "I have received a number of letters asking me to give some account of Old Farmer\
  \ Frack. It is true that he was a mad old man, probably due to ergot poisoning.\
  \ But he could be surprisingly lucid, too. For a time he employed a professional\
  \ voice coach, more used to working with thespians, to help him develop exciting\
  \ new roars and bellows. His cows were much given to bellowing, and Old Farmer Frack\
  \ wanted to be able to bellow back in a way they would understand.\nThe voice coach\
  \ was Satnav Gobgag, scion of the Bulgarian aeroplane manufacturing dynasty, whose\
  \ huge hangars on the outskirts of Plovdiv were the site of tremendous aeronautical\
  \ innovation during the interwar years. Satnav was a great disappointment to his\
  \ parents and grandparents and great-grandparents, for despite receiving a first\
  \ class education in the kinds of things that would make anyone fit to head an aeroplane-building\
  \ business, he turned his back on the family firm and devoted himself to the questionable\
  \ career\u2014questionable in Bulgaria at that time, anyway\u2014of drilling drama-struck\
  \ misters and misses in the art of projecting their voices, be they dulcet or stentorian.\
  \ It has been said that no one took to the stage of the Plovdiv Theatricum in the\
  \ middle years of the last century who had not learned their stuff from Satnav Gobgag.\n\
  Exiled after the war to the country where Old Farmer Frack herded his tubercular\
  \ cows, and by now grey and stooped and often covered in crumbs and dust, Satnav\
  \ Gobgag fetched up at a ruined hotel on the seafront at Cack. He was only thirty-four,\
  \ but looked to be twice that age, such had been his privations. It is well worth\
  \ avoiding such privations if one can, but Satnav did not have the benefit of hindsight.\
  \ Cut off without a penny by the Gobgag clan, accompanied in his exile by his pet\
  \ coot, Satnav was on the point of starvation when into his hotel one day wandered\
  \ Old Farmer Frack.\nQ\u2014What was the mad old man doing there, so far away from\
  \ his cows?\nA\u2014He was in Cack to collect bags of sand, and stopped in at the\
  \ hotel for a greasy breakfast, for he was fond of greasy breakfasts, but back at\
  \ the farm usually made do with a dish of cowfeed.\nQ\u2014For what purpose did\
  \ Old Farmer Frack need bags of sand from the beach at Cack?\nA\u2014To forestall,\
  \ or avert, the flooding of his barns.\nThe pair struck up a conversation in the\
  \ breakfast room of the hotel. And of what did they speak, this ill-matched duo?\
  \ Why, they chattered away about the single topic that was convulsing the citizenry\
  \ of Cack in those dark days, namely the invasion of an army of killer moorhens\
  \ which was sweeping through the town in wave after wave of destructive mayhem.\
  \ Satnav's poor coot was cooped up in his hotel room for its own protection, and\
  \ the penniless voice coach was frantic with fear what would happen to it when,\
  \ as must surely soon happen, he and his coot were tossed out on their ears for\
  \ non-payment. He reckoned without the lackadaisical approach of the hotel manager,\
  \ Grimes, who affected a foppish disregard for such niceties as money. So long as\
  \ his chef cooked up a greasy breakfast, and there were petunias in the plant pots,\
  \ Grimes was happy to lean against the wall in the lobby flicking ash onto the tiles\
  \ from the Norwegian cigars he had specially flown in. By coincidence, his smokes\
  \ arrived once a month on an aircraft of Gobgag manufacture.\nOld Farmer Frack was\
  \ temperamentally blind to any animals except his cows, so his brain was perplexed\
  \ by this talk of moorhens. He kept trying to change the subject, without success.\
  \ After a while, he sat back in a daze, hypnotised by his companion's mellifluous\
  \ fluting, high-pitched jabbering, booming ostinato, silky whispers, and impeccable\
  \ diction, for Satnav was deploying all of his vocal talents in describing the terrible\
  \ sight of a thousand murderous moorhens tramping relentlessly towards the shopping\
  \ arcade. It was when he made a noise like a cow that Old Farmer Frack sprang out\
  \ of his seat, grabbed him roughly by the collar, and demanded that he repeat his\
  \ bovine bellowing. Shortly thereafter, a deal was struck between the two men. Satnav\
  \ Gobgag fetched his coot, and his paltry luggage, from his room, and accompanied\
  \ Old Farmer Frack aboard his cart as they trundled off along meandering lanes to\
  \ the farm.\nWithin days, the mad old fool was having rewarding conversations with\
  \ his cows. He bellowed at them and they bellowed back. As he herded them from field\
  \ to field, purposelessly, through all hours of the day and night, his voice coach\
  \ reclined on a rickety sofa improving his English with a thorough reading of Dobson\
  \ pamphlets while his coot plashed happily in Farmer Frack's pond.\nThe idyll could\
  \ not last. One autumnal day, when fallen leaves from the pugton trees so clogged\
  \ the pond that the coot stayed indoors, there came a hammering at the door. Old\
  \ Farmer Frack was miles away, in the furthest of his fields, though a faint bellowing\
  \ could be heard when the wind died down. The coot, still nerve-wracked from its\
  \ sight, through the hotel window, of lethal moorhens, trembled. Satnav Gobgag dropped\
  \ his pamphlet\u2014I think it was Dobson's Some Remarks On The Grotesque Pallor\
  \ I Encountered This Morning In My Shaving Mirror (out of print)\u2014and strode\
  \ in his brave Bulgarian way to the door. Opening it, he was astonished to find\
  \ Grimes, the hotelier of Cack, florid with rage and somehow deeply threatening\
  \ in a windcheater the colour of custard and a stout pair of wellington boots. All\
  \ foppishness gone, Grimes had come to demand money. So much money, in fact, that\
  \ Satnav pictured himself doing the washing up in the unsavoury hotel kitchen for\
  \ the next forty years.\nQ\u2014Had something happened to Grimes to make him suddenly\
  \ mindful of the unpaid bills of his hotel guests?\nA\u2014Yes. He received a clonk\
  \ on the head from a piece of falling masonry.\nQ\u2014Had he tracked down other\
  \ past guests, or did he have some sort of vendetta against Satnav Gobgag?\nA\u2014\
  The former. Grimes now spent his days on horseback, criss-crossing the land demanding\
  \ money with menaces from those who had taken advantage of his formerly lax manner.\n\
  Q\u2014What menaces did he threaten?\nA\u2014Menaces so heinous they are unsuitable\
  \ for family reading.\nQ\u2014What happened next?\nA\u2014Satnav Gobgag did the\
  \ washing up in the unsavoury hotel kitchen for the next forty years. His coot remained\
  \ on the farm, where he visited it every other weekend until it perished. Old Farmer\
  \ Frack, having learned as much bovine bellowing as he needed, continued to be mad,\
  \ and bellowing, and his cows bellowed back at him, for ever and ever, Amen.\n[2007-03-22]"
