  \ This prompts a little song we can all sing as we round up our chickens (if we\
  \ have any):\nBring in your chickens!\n  It's Indoor Poultry Week.\n  Pop your chicken\
  \ on the couch\n  And pat its little beak.\nApparently we should also be on the\
  \ lookout for dead or debilitated swans, and report any sightings to the police.\n\
