text: 'Twenty years ago, under the Malice Aforethought Press imprint, Mr Key published
  an important pamphlet by Professor Zoltan Crunlop regarding crop circles. It is,
  of course, out of print, although one lengthy sentence from it was abstracted and
  recycled as a helpful brain-strengthening tool, available in the Archives here.


  Out of the blue, a letter from the Professor arrived today, sent from the St Blodwyn
  Mercy Home For Decrepit Cerealogists.

  Dear Mr Key, he writes, or rather scratches with a crabbed nib, As you know I am
  a man of science, and that being the case, I revise my theories in the light of
  new evidence. Much as I would like to stand by every last syllable in that important
  pamphlet I wrote for you twenty years ago, I fear I can no longer do so. On no account
  must you ever allow it to be reissued, although god knows I could do with the royalties,
  as it is costing me an arm and a leg to maintain some form of comfort here in good
  old Saint Blodwyn''s. My morning bowl of gruel has already been reduced to a morning
  half-a-bowl of gruel, and some of my cushions have been taken away. Oh, listen to
  me, groaning and moaning! That is not what this letter is about. The thing is, you
  see, that what I never considered, when I was writing my important pamphlet all
  those years ago, was the very real possibility that all crop circles are created
  by twelve Belgian lace-making nuns. Why didn''t I think of that? In spite of the
  fact that my eyesight is fast failing, everything now seems clear to me. Of course,
  of course, it was nuns all along! Passionately yours, Zoltan.

  I am pleased we have cleared that one up.
