text: "Listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will be aware of my boundless admiration\
  \ for the pulp writer Hal K Wells. Many's the time I have read out on the show one\
  \ particular quotation from his story Black Pool For Hell Maidens, to wit:\n\_\n\
  Carlin's deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace.\n\u201CI could shoot\
  \ you both down where you stand,\u201D he rasped, \u201Cbut that would be a foolish\
  \ waste of valuable material\u2026 I shall turn the two of you over to the Dweller\
  \ in the pool!\u201D\n\_Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's thin lips writhed\
  \ in a snarling smile\u2026\n\u201CWho, or what, is the Dweller in the pool?\u201D\
  \ demanded Kent, \u201CAnd what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway?\u201D\n\
  \u201CThe Dweller in the pool,\u201D Dorothy answered, her low voice trembling,\
  \ \u201Cis my brother, Raoul!\u201D \u2026\nSmall wonder that the throbbing agony\
  \ of so many tortured minds should combine to taint the very air with a shuddering\
  \ miasma of crepitant dread!\nThat \u201CMy brother, Raoul!\u201D gets me every\
  \ time.\nI am pleased to report, via Odd Ends, that another Wells story has been\
  \ added at Project Gutenberg. In Devil Crystals Of Arret, young Larry faces a six-hour\
  \ deadline of death, plus rat-men, octopus-bats, eldritch music and tinkling devil\
  \ crystals! So alluring is the prospect of wallowing in a Wellsian miasma, I have\
  \ had to put on hold my plan to read the umpteen volumes of John Ruskin's Fors Clavigera\_\
  : Letters To The Workmen And Labourers Of Great Britain, a work Guy Davenport suggested\
  \ is comparable only to Tristram Shandy in its magnificent eccentricity.\nThe Sun\
  \ newspaper\u2014yes, The Sun!\u2014once commanded its readers \u201CGo thee to\
  \ H P Lovecraft and shudder!\u201D Excellent advice, you'll agree, and I would like\
  \ to echo it by recommending you do the same with Hal K Wells. A few more of his\
  \ tales are available online here.\n\_\n[2009-04-30]"
