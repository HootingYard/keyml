text: "The first thing I did this morning, after getting up at 4.50 AM, was to find\
  \ out about Sir John Vanbrugh. The real, historical Sir John Vanbrugh (1664\u2013\
  1726), architect of Blenheim Palace and author of The Provok'd Wife, turned out\
  \ to have little in common with the Sir John Vanbrugh (dates uncertain) who appeared\
  \ in the dream from which I had just awoken.\nMy dream-Vanbrugh was famed as a painter\
  \ of chickens. He had painted a particular type of white chicken so many times that\
  \ it was known as \u201Ca Vanbrugh chicken\u201D. Connoisseurs eagerly sought out\
  \ Vanbrugh chicken paintings in auction salesrooms, where they sold for tidy sums.\n\
  Wide awake now, I can still see a Vanbrugh chicken, white with a red crop, in my\
  \ mind's eye.\n\n[2011-09-02]"
