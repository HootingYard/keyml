text: "Cast your mind back to the sixteenth of January. That was the day I posted\
  \ an item, under the heading Mrs Snooke's Tortoise, about Sylvia Townsend Warner's\
  \ 1946 book The Portrait Of A Tortoise, where she extracted from the Journals of\
  \ the 18th century clergyman Gilbert White all the entries regarding his tortoise,\
  \ Timothy. I suggested at the time that a reading of this would make a splendid\
  \ special edition of Hooting Yard On The Air, and lo! it has come to pass. I recorded\
  \ it this morning, and it will be broadcast on ResonanceFM over the Christmas/New\
  \ Year fortnight. I am not yet sure of the date, but keep an eye on the schedule\
  \ and be sure not to miss it.\nUPDATE\_: The programme will be broadcast at 12.20\
  \ PM on Boxing Day, December 26th.\n[2008-12-19]"
