  \ midnight as I crept through the graveyard. The sky was pitch black, the stars\
  \ obscured by clouds. My Toc H lamp shed only meagre light, and I stumbled many\
  \ times over the rough and ravaged ground. Somewhere an owl hooted. I hooted in\
  \ reply, mischievously, for even in so macabre a circumstance I retained my joie\
  \ de vivre. Well, you have to, don't you, when surrounded by doom \u2018n\u2019\
  \ death \u2018n\u2019 memento mori?\nPerched on a promontory overlooking the awful\
  \ sea, the graveyard was whipped by winds. How they howled! So, so many of the tombstones\
  \ had toppled, over the years, over the centuries, and the salt wind had crumbled\
  \ them. As I had hooted at the owl, so I howled at the wind. I hooted, I howled,\
  \ and then I chuckled insouciantly, like the dandy I can be, at my best, and I held\
  \ my lamp aloft as I peered into the black. Somewhere hereabouts was the ossuary,\
  \ where bones were stacked, innumerable, abandoned. Within the vault, not a single\
  \ bone, I'd been told, had a tag that might identify it, that could have led to\
  \ it rejoining the other bones with which, once, as a skeletal structure, it had\
  \ lurked inside a body, with breath and blood and life. Lonely abandoned bones lay\
  \ in stacks in the ossuary\u2014and here I come, at dead of night!\nOn Thursday,\
  \ during a rainstorm, I took shelter in the library. Unlike most modern libraries,\
  \ this one still had some books in it. By some miracle, they had not been consigned\
  \ in their hundreds of thousands to a lime-pit. Browsing the shelves, I lit upon\
  \ a tome entitled The academy of armoury, or a storehouse of armoury and blazon\_\
  : containing the several variety of created beings, and how born in coats of arms,\
  \ both foreign and domestick\_: with the instruments used in all trades and sciences,\
  \ together with their terms of art\_: also the etymologies, definitions, and historical\
  \ observations on the same, explicated and explained according to our modern language\_\
  : very useful for all gentlemen, scholars, divines, and all such as desire any knowledge\
  \ in arts and sciences by Randle Holme. It was over three hundred years old, having\
  \ been published in 1688, and if the slip pasted in the frontispiece was to be believed,\
  \ no one had borrowed it from the library since 1819, the year John Ruskin was born.\
  \ Gosh, I thought, sweeping a hand through my terrific hairstyle. Now armouries\
  \ I can take or leave, but I have ever been fascinated, to the point of loosened\
  \ bowels, by blazons. It is the kind of chap I am, simply put. Don't ask me why.\
  \ Better by far, I'd say, to be a blazonist than a vinkenier. In any case, I am\
  \ only half Flemish. Later, perhaps, I will tell you about the other half of my\
  \ ancestry. Both halves are mostly bones, now, bones rotten and crumbled to dust,\
  \ but then that is true of every man jack of us, isn't it?, so it is hardly worth\
  \ saying.\nI propped the Holme tome on a lectern, and, as the downpour continued\
  \ to beat relentlessly upon the smudged and grubby windows, and the sky darkened,\
  \ I leafed through the pages. The book smelled, for some reason, of vinegar. What\
  \ could the reason be? I pictured to myself a nineteenth century blazonist, perhaps\
  \ a rather caddish one in Regency trews, tossing the book into a trough of vinegar\
  \ as he sallied towards a pump room. Did they have troughs filled with vinegar in\
  \ those days, for a purpose beyond my ken? I knew not, and Randle Holme wasn't going\
  \ to tell me. He was going to tell me about armouries and blazons.\nBut he was also\
  \ going to tell me something else, something of great import for this present essay.\
  \ What he told me, in the failing light, at the lectern in the library, in liber\
  \ III, page 429, paragraph 1, was this\_: Raspatorium, Rasping hookes; ..Scraping\
  \ Instruments to shave and scrape filthy and scaly bones. It's called also Xyster.\n\
  I \_knew what I had to do. I slammed the book shut, replaced it on the shelf where\
  \ I found it, and I strode\u2014no, I minced\u2014out into what I thought was rain,\
  \ only to have myriad tiny hailstones pinging on to my bonce. As luck would have\
  \ it, there was a surgical instrument \u2018n\u2019 appliance shop bang next door\
  \ to the library. I ducked inside, out of the hail, and made immediate purchase\
  \ of a xyster.\n\u201CWhat do you want it for?\u201D asked the shopkeeper, a surly\
  \ sort whose parents, I surmised, had never coddled him.\n\u201CFor the scraping\
  \ of filthy and scaly bones!\u201D I cried, using my theatrical training.\n\u201C\
  All well and good,\u201D he replied, somewhat crestfallen. I think he was less interested\
  \ in making a sale than in outwitting me, for some skewed psychological frolic of\
  \ his own.\n\u201CWrap it for me,\u201D I commanded, \u201CWith pastry paper and\
  \ butcher's string.\u201D\nHe did as he was bid, a broken shopkeeper.\nI took my\
  \ xyster home, and waited for the darkness to fall. Then I changed into garb appropriate\
  \ for the practice of creeping among toppled tombstones, and I stole out of my chalet\
  \ and climbed towards the promontory, and I scaled the graveyard gates and made\
  \ for the ossuary, the xyster clutched tightly in my dainty, dainty, yellow-begloved\
  \ hand.\n[2010-10-05]"
