text: "What is it with these clergymen and their phantasms? The other day we had the\
  \ Bishop of Bergen, Erik Pontoppidan, babbling on about sea monsters, and now we\
  \ find that rustic Victorian, the Reverend Francis Kilvert, writing in his diary,\
  \ on this day in 1872:\nThis morning I conceived the idea of a poem in the style\
  \ of Tam o\u2019 Shanter\u2014the scene to be laid in the ruined church of Llanbedr\
  \ Painscastle. Two lovers who had made an assignation in the church-yard to be terrified\
  \ by seeing through the windows an assembly of devils, ghosts, lawless lovers and\
  \ murdered children.\nUntil I read that, I thought Kilvert's Diary was akin to Gilbert\
  \ White's Natural History Of Selborne, a series of observations on rural life and\
  \ the natural world, gentle and rather winsome. I did not expect lawless lovers\
  \ and murdered children in ruined churches. But then, I have never read Kilvert's\
  \ Diary, and came upon the above entry in The Assassin's Cloak\_: An Anthology Of\
  \ The World's Greatest Diarists, edited by Irene and Alan Taylor (2000).\nSince\
  \ 1977, Peter Blegvad has had an ongoing project called \u201CImagined, Observed,\
  \ Remembered\u201D, best summarised by Mr B. himself:\nI began drawing sundry items\
  \ thrice\u2014first as I imagined them to be, then as I actually observed them to\
  \ be, and lastly, after a suitable interval, as I remembered them to have been.\n\
  It occurred to me that I could apply this idea\u2014at least, the Imagined and Observed\
  \ elements\u2014in prose rather than drawings, to the Reverend Kilvert. After all,\
  \ though I have never read the diary, I have heard of it. Where or when it first\
  \ swam into my ken I have no idea, but I would have come upon stray references to\
  \ it in my reading from as long ago as my teenperson years. My Imagined Kilvert,\
  \ and his diary, would be along these lines:\nA nineteenth-century country parson,\
  \ somewhere in England, elderly, with a long white Victorian beard. Daily, he records\
  \ the passing of the seasons in his rural idyll, concentrating his attention on\
  \ flowers and hedgerows and birds. Unlike Pontoppidan, he does not include the peasantry\
  \ in his natural history, though occasionally a peasant might have a walk-on part\
  \ in a diary entry, for example to impart a piece of rustic lore or wisdom to the\
  \ absent-minded vicar. We learn little or nothing of Kilvert's inner life, nor much\
  \ of his everyday clergyman's duties. The diary, which has never been out of print\
  \ since first published, shortly after his death, is still read because he is a\
  \ superb observer and recorder of the natural world, and evokes a vision of the\
  \ quiet English countryside that makes it seem a very paradise.\nHence my surprise\
  \ at the devils and ghosts and lawless lovers and murdered children. Time now for\
  \ a cup of tea, and then I shall find out what I can about the Reverend, \u201C\
  Observed\u201D, in Peter Blegvad's sense, by way of reference materials.\nI am delighted\
  \ to announce that I was right about the beard. Well, sort of. (Has anybody ever\
  \ written a book-length study entitled The Victorian Beard? I would read it.) Sadly,\
  \ Kilvert (1840\u20131879) did not live long enough for it to grow white, for he\
  \ died\u2014of peritonitis\u2014at the age of thirty-eight, shortly after returning\
  \ from his honeymoon. I was correct, too, to imagine him as a country vicar. After\
  \ studying at Oxford, he served a number of parishes in Wiltshire and on the Welsh\
  \ Borders. Other than that, my Imagined Kilvert is a partial and inaccurate picture\
  \ of the real one, particularly where the diary is concerned.\nThough there is much\
  \ observation of nature, the diary is far more comprehensive in its concerns\u2014\
  as much social history as natural history. It includes comic scenes such as a funeral\
  \ at Worcester cathedral where the pallbearers stagger under the weight of a \u201C\
  crushingly heavy\u201D coffin, an account of Kilvert bathing naked and disporting\
  \ himself upon the beach, and a lengthy discussion of venereal disease conducted\
  \ at a ruridecanal conference. (Now there's a useful word\u2014ruridecanal: pertaining\
  \ to a rural dean and his jurisdiction.) The rustic rev also devotes over forty-four\
  \ passages to descriptions of women and girls, frankly confessing his \u201Csusceptibility\
  \ to female beauty\u201D. His writing has been compared to Hardy, Hopkins, and even\
  \ to Proust. \u201CFor some time,\u201D he wrote in 1874, \u201CI have been trying\
  \ to find the right word for the shimmering, glancing, tumbling movement of the\
  \ poplar leaves in the sun and wind. It was \u2018dazzle\u2019. The dazzle of the\
  \ poplars.\u201D\nFar from being \u201Cnever out of print since first published,\
  \ shortly after his death\u201D, as I imagined, the diary's history is much more\
  \ chequered. For one thing, much of the original manuscript has been lost or (deliberately)\
  \ destroyed. Kilvert's widow, who never remarried, lived until 1911 and seems to\
  \ have removed entire sequences recounting \u201Cwild sad sweet trysts\u201D with\
  \ an earlier paramour. The standard selection we think of as Kilvert's Diary was\
  \ made by William Plomer and first published in three volumes between 1938 and 1940.\
  \ Other editions have followed, but as far as I know it has gone in and out of print.\n\
  One thing I could not have imagined was the name of Kilvert's mother\u2014Thermuthis\
  \ Ashe. It's not every day you meet a Thermuthis.\nAs for the poem he was planning,\
  \ one hundred and forty years ago today, about two lovers who had made an assignation\
  \ in the church-yard at Llanbedr Painscastle, I have not been able to ascertain\
  \ if Kilvert ever wrote it. He did write a number of poems, but none were published\
  \ in his lifetime. The ruined church, incidentally, was restored in the year of\
  \ Kilvert's death. I append a photograph of it, no longer ruinous, below. If you\
  \ peer at it very very carefully, you might just be able to see an assembly of devils,\
  \ ghosts, lawless lovers and murdered children.\n\n[2012-05-09]"
