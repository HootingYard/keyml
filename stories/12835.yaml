text: "Word of the day\_: Clunk.\nI had hoped, today, to deal with the word clunk,\
  \ as well as catching up with yesterday's word, boggle, which as you recall had\
  \ to be postponed while I addressed further matters regarding parp. Alas, I am diverted\
  \ from my proper course by another letter from Wlad Onanugu. This time he writes:\n\
  Dear Mr Key, I was touched by your thoughtfulness in recommending to me further\
  \ reading on the knotty problem of parp and toot and hooter and tots, et cetera.\
  \ Indeed, I was so touched that I am afraid to say I let a few tears run down my\
  \ cheeks. My weeping and snuffling soon ceased, however, when the significance of\
  \ those parenthetical words \u201C(out of print)\u201D appended to the recommended\
  \ title sank in. Sure enough, as I trudged around the bookselling kiosks of the\
  \ dilapidated seaside resort where I live, I discovered that this Dobson pamphlet\
  \ was completely unavailable. I was met with blank stares, looks of incredulity,\
  \ a pitying pat on the head, and, by one particularly apoplectic bookseller, the\
  \ threat of his slavering, sharp-fanged guard dog.\nEventually, at a jumble sale\
  \ at the local self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity awareness hub, my rummaging did\
  \ unearth a pamphlet by Dobson. A glance at the Gestetnered cover, however, revealed\
  \ that it was devoted to a wholly different topic. The title was Several Potentates\
  \ Of The Ancient World With Collapsed Lungs & Their Concubines (out of print). I\
  \ bought it anyway, for tuppence, and took it home hoping that perhaps the pamphleteer\
  \ might have a passing word to say somewhere about the whole parp toot hooter tots\
  \ business.\nArriving home, I snapped open a refreshing can of Squelcho!, plopped\
  \ myself down in my armchair, and began to read. Shortly thereafter, I was weeping\
  \ again, but this time from brain-jangling frustration. The pamphlet seemed to me\
  \ the most utter poppycock, and try as I might I could wring no sense from it whatsoever.\
  \ If this is a typical example of Dobson's work, I am feeling quite relieved that\
  \ I did not continue my search for the pamphlet you recommended. Please send me\
  \ a postal order for tuppence as compensation.\nI am sorry that Mr Onanugu found\
  \ Dobson's prose intractable. There is a possibility, however, that he may well\
  \ have stumbled upon a copy of the notorious \u201Crogue\u201D edition of Several\
  \ Potentates Of The Ancient World With Collapsed Lungs & Their Concubines. This\
  \ was the one where the original text\u2014a model of shining clarity and Dobsonian\
  \ oomph\u2014was translated into Hungarian, and from Hungarian into Tagalog, and\
  \ from Tagalog into Dog Latin, before being translated back into English. It was\
  \ the work of the mischievous literary prankster Hector Nuisance.\nTomorrow I hope\
  \ to crack on with boggle, and clunk, and tomorrow's word of the day, glue.\n[2014-07-25]"
