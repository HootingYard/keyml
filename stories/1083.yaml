text: "\u201CMiss Stein likes to look at rocks and cows in the intervals of her writing.\
  \ The two ladies drive around in their Ford till they come to a good spot. Then\
  \ Miss Stein gets out and sits on a campstool with pencil and pad, and Miss Toklas\
  \ fearlessly switches a cow into her line of vision. If the cow doesn't seem to\
  \ fit in with Miss Stein's mood, the ladies get into the car and drive on to another\
  \ cow. When the great lady has an inspiration, she writes quickly, for about fifteen\
  \ minutes. But often she just sits there, looking at cows and not turning a wheel.\u201D\
  \nA splendid example of the intersection of cows and literature, from a 1934 New\
  \ Yorker profile of Gertrude Stein quoted in Daily Routines (How writers, artists,\
  \ and other interesting people organise their days), an excellent new blog. Among\
  \ those so far included are Franz Kafka, Emily Dickinson, Charles Darwin, and Anthony\
  \ Trollope. Neither Dobson nor Pebblehead has yet been attended to, and I may have\
  \ to deal with those two titans myself.\n[2008-12-17]"
