text: "Given the latest act of lethal stupidity by the homicidal barbarian community,\
  \ it seemed timely to repost this piece, which first appeared exactly six years\
  \ ago today.\nBad Blodgett! One Tuesday in spring, he went a-roaming among the Perspex\
  \ Caves of Lamont, part of that magnificent artificial coastline immortalised in\
  \ mezzotints by the mezzotintist Rex Tint. Sheltering in one of the caves from a\
  \ sudden downpour, Blodgett took his sketchbook out of his satchel and passed the\
  \ time making a series of cartoon drawings of historical figures. The pictures were\
  \ imaginary likenesses, of course, for Blodgett was ignorant of many things, and\
  \ he had no idea what Blind Jack of Knaresborough looked like. Nor was he at all\
  \ sure that his double cartoon of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray bore any resemblance\
  \ to the stars of Double Indemnity. The rain showed no sign of ceasing, so Blodgett\
  \ filled page after page, scribbling drawings of Marcus Aurelius, Christopher Smart,\
  \ Mary Baker Eddy, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, and the Prophet Mohammed, among\
  \ others. It was this last cartoon that caused ructions which were to have so decisive\
  \ an effect on Blodgett's life.\nLater that day, on his way home from the Perspex\
  \ Caves of Lamont, Blodgett inadvertently left his sketchbook on the bus. A week\
  \ or so later, a bus company employee was checking through the lost property and\
  \ took a few moments to leaf through the book. Turning the fateful page, this employee\u2014\
  an adherent of the Islamic faith\u2014was by turns outraged, humiliated, mortally\
  \ offended and infuriated when he saw Blodgett's cartoon. As is the way with such\
  \ matters, he immediately arranged for copies to be distributed to mullahs and imams\
  \ around the world, so that they too could share his outrage, humiliation, mortal\
  \ offence and fury. Soon there were calls for Blodgett to be beheaded or otherwise\
  \ put to death, and he went into hiding. Let's take a look at the picture, so that\
  \ we can understand what all the fuss was about.\n\n(In an interesting side note,\
  \ there was a similar flurryof anger from a sect devoted to the cult of Fred MacMurray,\
  \ but this fizzled out after Blodgett pledged to attend a penitential screening\
  \ of one of the actor's late pieces of Disney pap.)\nMeanwhile, hiding out in the\
  \ Perspex Caves of Lamont, the evil cartoonist had time to think through what had\
  \ happened. Blodgett was aware that the Victorian atheist Charles Bradlaugh had\
  \ described the Christian Gospels as being \u201Cconcocted by illiterate half-starved\
  \ visionaries in some dark corner of a Graeco-Syrian slum\u201D, and he did not\
  \ think it much of a leap to conclude that the Prophet Mohammed was an equally deluded\
  \ soul, although perhaps a better-organised one, with access to weaponry which enabled\
  \ him to spread his message faster and more efficiently.\nAround this time, Blodgett\
  \ received through an intermediary an offer from the furious and offended Islamists.\
  \ The sentence of death could be rescinded, they suggested, if he made a sincere\
  \ conversion to their faith and promised to live out the rest of his days in submission\
  \ to Allah. Blodgett considered this for about forty seconds before rejecting it.\
  \ Apart from anything else, he reasoned, it was very unlikely that Mrs Blodgett\
  \ would agree to spend the rest of her life cocooned in a person-sized tent and\
  \ to stop going out by herself.\nShortly after this, still in hiding, Blodgett had\
  \ a brainwave. Indeed, he became somewhat furious and offended himself. The conversion\
  \ offer, he decided, was an example of the old clich\xE9 \u201CIf you can't beat\
  \ them, join them\u201D. Well\u2026 he would join them, but not in the way they\
  \ thought. If half-starved visionaries could propagate the Christian gospels, and\
  \ Mohammed could claim to have heard the voice of God, as so many others down the\
  \ centuries had insisted, with varying degrees of success, that they were in direct\
  \ contact with supernatural powers, what was to stop Blodgett announcing that he,\
  \ and only he, had found the true path? From this spark of inspiration was Blodgettism\
  \ born.\nHe began to make clandestine visits to the municipal library at Blister\
  \ Lane, devouring, among other works, the Qu'ran, the Bible, the collected works\
  \ of L Ron Hubbard and David Icke, the Book of Mormon, sacred texts from all the\
  \ major religions and many of the minor ones, even a couple of novels by Ayn Rand.\
  \ After a few weeks of constant reading, Blodgett set out to define Blodgettism.\
  \ He did not want it to be a synthesis of every other faith\u2014that seemed a little\
  \ too pat, a little too Blavatskyesque\u2014and nor did he want it to be simply\
  \ an amalgam of the good bits. Considering that he was still under sentence of death\
  \ from a number of shouting men with beards, Blodgett wanted Blodgettism to be a\
  \ faith at once as rigorous and intransigent as Islam. Thus, he cast aside with\
  \ reluctance some of the more amusing things he had learned, such as underwear regulations\
  \ in Mormonism, and Mr Hubbard's intergalactic drivel, and fixed his attention on\
  \ jihad. As far as jihad-as-inner-struggle was concerned, Blodgett could not give\
  \ a hoot. But jihad-as-holy-war appealed to him as a way of taking on his persecutors,\
  \ and thus became the most important feature of the Blodgettist religion.\nIn The\
  \ Book Of Blodgett, published in paperback the following year, it has to be said\
  \ that the founder of the new religion makes an impeccably reasonable argument in\
  \ favour of his faith. Having devised a set of laws\u2014called Blodgettia\u2014\
  he announces that it is the duty of everyone on earth to obey them, or be killed.\
  \ Taking his cue mainly from the Qu'ran and the Old Testament, Blodgett devised\
  \ an appropriately illogical and arbitrary set of regulations for human behaviour.\
  \ The list of laws is too long and abstruse to reproduce here, but a couple of examples\
  \ will suffice.\nBlodgettia Law Number 12. Thou shalt not eat plums within ten yards\
  \ of a pig or a goat or a starling. Those that disobey this law will be bundled\
  \ up in sacking and thrown into a canal.\nBlodgettia Law Number 49. It is forbidden\
  \ to wear your hat at other than a jaunty angle. See appendix for diagrams of angles\
  \ of jauntiness and non-jauntiness. Officials of the Committee For The Promotion\
  \ Of Blodgettian Virtue And The Wholesale Suppression Of Blodgettian Vice And Abomination,\
  \ armed with protractors and tape measures, will fan out across the land, and where\
  \ they find hats worn at non-jaunty angles they shall proceed to poke malefactors\
  \ with pointy sticks before putting them to an entirely justifiable death.\nOf course,\
  \ the Prophet Mohammed\u2014let's just take a look at that picture again, to remind\
  \ ourselves \u2013\n\nAs I was saying, the Prophet Mohammed was able to spread his\
  \ word through a combination of historical and geographic circumstance and violence.\
  \ Alas, Blodgettism never really took root, numbering perhaps only three or four\
  \ devotees at its height, including Blodgett himself. But there are a few copies\
  \ of The Book Of Blodgett which have not been pulped or thrown into dustbins, and\
  \ they may yet inspire a new generation of fanatical adherents, who will demand,\
  \ in big shouty voices, that they are right and every one else is wrong, and get\
  \ very upset and angry if you disagree with them, and it will be your fault if they\
  \ decide to blow you up or chop off your head. Be warned.\n[2012-09-13]"
