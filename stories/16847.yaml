text: "In the early 1960s, my paternal grandmother went mad and was carted off to\
  \ a Mercy Home for the Baffled and Bewildered. It was run by an order called the\
  \ Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, and my grandmother spent her final decade\
  \ contented and happy. Surrounded by nuns, she perhaps believed that she had realised\
  \ a lifelong ambition, and become a nun herself. The home, in Lytham St Annes, was\u2014\
  still is\u2014called Stella Matutina.\n\n\n\ncirca 1935: A milkman chats with a\
  \ father holding a baby, as he leaves the daily quota of milk on the doorstep. (Photo\

  \ of last year, my brother acquired a dog. It was the first time he had ever had\
  \ a pet pooch and, by all accounts, possession of the dog \u201Cchanged his life\u201D\
  . The name he gave to this dog was Stella Matutina.\nI find this psychologically\
  \ fascinating. It would be intriguing to plumb the depths of my brother's psyche\
  \ in relation to dogs and mad grandmothers and nuns. As the psychiatrist remarked\
  \ in Fawlty Towers, \u201Cthere's enough material there for an entire conference\u201D\
