text: "Dennis Beerpint's latest poetry collection, a slim volume of twee verse entitled\
  \ Groaning Minions, is an experiment in what the weedy ex-beatnik calls \u201Cfictional\
  \ autobiography\u201D. \u201CFictional\u201D, note, not \u201Cfictionalised\u201D\
  . In a preface he makes his intentions clear:\nBy any measure, my life has been\
  \ one of unremitting tedium. Nothing remotely interesting ever happens to me, nor\
  \ do I cause anything of remark to occur. My motto can be encoupleted as \u201C\
  Neither a mover nor a shaker be / Just write verse relentlessly twee\u201D. In my\
  \ advancing years, however, rightly celebrated as probably the greatest poet ever\
  \ to tread the earth, I am constantly beset by eager young whippersnappers beating\
  \ a path to my door, clutching their notebooks and propelling pencils and tape recorders,\
  \ desperate to hear me tell tales of my life so they might be the one to write the\
  \ Life. It always amuses me to watch them doze off as I explain that, no, I never\
  \ swapped beekeeping tips with Sylvia Plath, I was never declared insane like Ezra\
  \ Pound, I never saw my work turned into a hit West End musical like T S Eliot,\
  \ and I never even shared a Lemsip with Andrew Motion. Having scurried breathlessly\
  \ up the path, the wannabe biographers trudge away a couple of hours later, their\
  \ notebooks empty, their cassette tapes blank.\nIt has occurred to me that if anyone\
  \ does ever succeed in writing my Life, the book will be so damned boring that nobody\
  \ will ever want to read it. Thus I have taken it upon myself to invent a life of\
  \ thrills and spills and adventures and extraordinary excitement, all of it chronicled\
  \ in the form of twee and vapid verse. Let future biographers pick over the contents\
  \ of the present volume, and rewrite it as prose. That will keep them occupied,\
  \ and I will no longer have to heave myself out of my armchair and answer the doorbell\
  \ to another panting whippersnapper, and parry a legion of pointless queries about\
  \ the part I played in the Spanish Civil War and the Hindenburg Disaster and the\
  \ Tet Offensive and the Orpington By-Election and the Relief of Mafeking and the\
  \ Munich Air Disaster and the Kennedy Assassination and the Cold War and the Cod\
  \ War and the Arab Spring and the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon and the\
  \ Winter of Discontent and many another world-shuddering kerfuffle.\nBeerpint appears\
  \ to be teasing us here, because there is not a single mention of any of those world-shuddering\
  \ kerfuffles in the forty-nine poems in the collection. Instead, we get a sort of\
  \ Ruritanian fantasy, with the fictional poet born and brought up in an eerie and\
  \ phantasmal castle, surrounded by the groaning minions of the title. Indeed, he\
  \ gets rather carried away by these minions, whose incessant groaning he is at pains\
  \ to account for. One, it seems, has a burst appendix. Another groans because he\
  \ is overtired. A third is a minion of melancholic disposition whose groaning is\n\
  Both religious, like a tortured Christian martyr\nAnd existentialist, like Jean-Paul\
  \ Sartre\nI was not going to quote directly from the book, what with Dennis Beerpint's\
  \ fondness for unleashing savage packs of wolves at any hint of copyright violation,\
  \ but perhaps I can be forgiven just the one couplet.\nThe poet's growing obsession\
  \ with the groaning minions is apparent when one considers that, though they make\
  \ only fleeting appearances in the first half of the book, from poem number twenty-six\
  \ onwards they are increasingly dominant. In fact, the concluding set of six villanelles\
  \ seem to consist of nothing but groaning, as if Beerpint's very psyche has been\
  \ invaded and overtaken by these minions of his childhood. This is both perplexing\
  \ and worrying when we lift our eyes from the page briefly to remind ourselves that\
  \ they are entirely fictional and never actually existed. The unrelenting focus\
  \ on the groaning minions also means that, in terms of chronology, Beerpint never\
  \ gets beyond the years of his youth. He thus undermines his own stated purpose\
  \ of fobbing off the doorbell-ringing wannabe biographers, who are still left in\
  \ the dark about the poet's involvement, or otherwise, in such world-shuddering\
  \ kerfuffles as the Spanish Civil War and the Hindenburg Disaster and the Tet Offensive\
  \ and the Orpington By-Election and the Relief of Mafeking and the Munich Air Disaster\
  \ and the Kennedy Assassination and the Cold War and the Cod War and the Arab Spring\
  \ and the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon and the Winter of Discontent.\n\
  It may be that he has a second volume of \u201Cfictional autobiography\u201D in\
  \ the works, but quite frankly, let us hope not.\n[2012-02-08]"
