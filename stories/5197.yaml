text: "\nThis week at The Dabbler I recommend the setting up of a free school with\
  \ a curriculum devoted to the works of John Ruskin, and include two Tales Of Little\
  \ Ruskin suitable for reading aloud to tinies. Incidentally, I could not help noticing\
  \ the manner in which the Grauniad reported the official approval given to the setting\
  \ up of sixteen such free schools. One idealistic teacher suggested that among the\
  \ things deemed important in his planned school, in a deprived area, would be good\
  \ manners and the basic civilised matter of sitting down together at mealtimes.\
  \ The privately-educated well-brought-up Grauniad staff take these things for granted,\
  \ of course, but the very idea that they should be inculcated in the lower orders\
  \ is anathema. The front page headline sneerily misrepresented the plans as teaching\
  \ \u201Cetiquette and fine dining\u201D.\n[2010-09-10]"
