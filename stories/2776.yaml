text: "See, children, this couple walking along the road. One is a tall, handsome,\
  \ and very finely made woman, with a beautiful mild firmness of expression, the\
  \ other a conceited little boy. Why, of course, it is Ma Ruskin taking a stroll\
  \ with Little Ruskin. They walk straight past the toyshop window without a glance.\
  \ Little Ruskin knows he will never be allowed the temptation of toys. But Ma Ruskin\
  \ has promised to take him to a spot, somewhere between Herne Hill and Camberwell,\
  \ where he may pick a pebble to take home with him. Little Ruskin loves his pebbles.\n\
  As they turn a corner, Little Ruskin's buoyant mood changes, however, for ahead\
  \ of them loom the great granite walls of the Charitable Mercy Home For Crippled\
  \ Tinies.\n\u201CCan we increase the speed of our strolling, Ma, the quicker to\
  \ be past this benighted cripplehaven?\u201D pleads Little Ruskin.\n\u201CWe shall\
  \ stroll at the pace the Lord intends,\u201D replies Ma Ruskin, not unkindly, but\
  \ with her usual mild firmness.\nLittle Ruskin begins to tremble.\nAnd then, children,\
  \ out of the gates of the Mercy Home comes Little Ruskin's worst nightmare! It is\
  \ a diminutive girlie with a twisted, deformed spine, and her hair is in ringlets!\n\
  \u201CAaaghh!\u201D screeches Little Ruskin, shielding his eyes from the horrible\
  \ sight and trying to hide himself in the folds of Ma Ruskin's skirts.\nMa Ruskin\
  \ scolds her son for making such a din and a spectacle, and she turns him about\
  \ and marches him home.\n\u201CThere will be no pebble for you today, Little Ruskin!\u201D\
  \ she says, mildly firm.\nAnd so, quaking with a mixture of disgust and horror,\
  \ Little Ruskin ends up back at the house on the hill, forbidden even to jump off\
  \ his favourite box.\nFurther reading\_: Praeterita, Volume I, Chapter V, here.\n\
