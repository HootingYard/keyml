text: "Glory be! \u2018Tis the fourteenth of January, Saint Mungo's Day, a landmark\
  \ date in the Hooting Yard calendar, as important in its way as the third, fourth\
  \ and fifth of February (the Muggletonian Great Holiday) and the nineteenth of July\
  \ (the Muggletonian Little Holiday). As far as I am aware, there is absolutely no\
  \ connection between Saint Mungo and Lodowicke Muggleton's holy crew, save that\
  \ the feast days and holidays of both are conscientiously observed here at Hooting\
  \ Yard, for reasons which I hope are obvious.\nAs a special treat for readers to\
  \ celebrate Saint Mungo's Day, let me announce the new subscription scheme. I know\
  \ full well that many of you toss and turn at night, victims of a vague sense of\
  \ unrest, kept awake by the nagging thought that you are able to read this grand\
  \ panoply of words online absolutely free. A lot of you have generously donated\
  \ to Mr Key's almost bare cupboard in the past, and I am mindful of the effort it\
  \ takes to do so. So now I have devised a scheme whereby you can make regular donations\
  \ without lifting a finger, apart of course from the initial setting up.\nLook!\
  \ At the top of the page, in the red rectangle, there is a new tab, second from\
  \ the right, called \u201CSubscriptions\u201D. If you click on it you will be taken\
  \ to a page showing you the four options available\u2014the Tiny Enid, the Old Halob,\
  \ the Pebblehead, and the Dobson. Full details are given of the cost of each subscription\
  \ and the use to which your funds will be put. Having plumped for the one that best\
  \ suits you, just click on the accompanying button and follow the simple instructions.\
  \ You will have no more sleepless nights, and can bathe in a warm glow of righteousness\
  \ that your favourite out of print pamphleteer is better placed to keep the wolf\
  \ from his door.\nThe wolf, by the way, is named Martin, and I shall have more to\
  \ say about him soon.\nNOTE\_: At the moment, that \u2018Subscribe\u2019 button\
  \ in the sidebar takes you automatically to the Old Halob option. It will be fixed,\
  \ until when use the tab at the top.\n[2009-01-14]"
