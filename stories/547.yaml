text: "Jean-Paul Sartre's trilogy The Roads To Freedom has fallen out of fashion somewhat\u2014\
  as if that mattered\u2014yet it remains a classic. But for a book with a bit more\
  \ existentialist heft, I recommend Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Roads\
  \ To Jaywick. That blighted, benighted, dilapidated seaside town, has of course,\
  \ provided fodder for any number of potboilers, including Jaywick\u2014West Of Clacton\
  \ and The Sordid Sands Of Squalor, but Pebblehead's is a fundamentally serious work,\
  \ and there is a lot about cows in it, which is always a good thing.\nIn an interview\
  \ with The Literary Dunderpate, the author explained the genesis of his novel. \u201C\
  One morning as I was eating marmalade straight from the jar with a spoon,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CIt occurred to me, in a flash of insight, that, if one is so minded,\
  \ all roads lead eventually to Jaywick. Once you approach the shabby resort itself\
  \ there is but the one road, pitted and unlovely and dismal, but to reach that road\
  \ one must travel along many other roads, depending on where you start from. You\
  \ might be in Gore Pit or Fingringhoe or Vange, or even in Messing or Fobbing or\
  \ Dengie: it doesn't much matter, for there will be a road wherever you are that\
  \ will lead you inexorably to the windswept collapsing hovels of Jaywick. Lord knows,\
  \ even from Mambeg and Clynder, if you have Jaywick in your soul you will find a\
  \ road to take you there.\u201D\nThat last phrase is telling. Pebblehead originally\
  \ planned to call his titanic masterpiece A Jaywick Of The Soul, but decided against\
  \ it. \u201CIt is true enough,\u201D he explained, \u201Cthat there is a sort of\
  \ psychoJaywick that lurks within the mind of every man and woman on the planet,\
  \ but I wanted to insist upon the real, physical Jaywick, that place where the sickened\
  \ traveller can come to a halt and go for a pint in the Never Say Die and get their\
  \ head kicked in by feral Jaywick youths.\u201D Pebblehead goes on to describe the\
  \ transfixing sense of Weltschmerz he felt when peering over the sea wall and seeing,\
  \ on the gruesome beach, a big sign warning him of \u201CDanger\u2014Keep Off\u201D\
  .\nAs a bestselling paperbackist, Pebblehead has sometimes been criticised for being\
  \ shackled to realism, and in the process of writing The Roads To Jaywick he did\
  \ indeed\_ test out his thesis by travelling by road to those glum coastal shacks\
  \ from a variety of starting points. He proved that roads from Threekingham and\
  \ Scratby and Snodland, from Coffinswell and Mugdock and Crundale, from Hoo and\
  \ Swillington and Catbrain and Widdop and Slack and Splat, from each of these, in\
  \ a cart pulled by inelegant horses, he could, eventually, reach Jaywick. And that,\
  \ he suggests, is what makes us human, arguing his case with a vivid account\u2014\
  taking up more than two-thirds of the book\u2014of the famous incident known in\
  \ Jaywick lore as The Day The Cows Came Visiting. The cows, of course, came not\
  \ by road but, being cows, across fields, across flat hopeless fields on a misty\
  \ morning. It is a haunting tale, and one to which Pebblehead's gorgeous prose does\
  \ justice.\nI believe it is a great scandal that The Roads To Jaywick is not a set\
  \ text to be read by tinies in all the community education hubs in the land. It\
  \ is all very well filling their heads with the likes of Sartre and De Beauvoir\
  \ and Norman Spinrad, but those who devise the curriculum will reap a whirlwind.\
  \ Better by far, surely, to envision a nation in which our urchins sit enraptured\
  \ in their study pods, lapping up the timeless words of Pebblehead? Pebblehead who,\
  \ for the sake of literature, lay drunkenly sprawled in the gutter outside the Never\
  \ Say Die in a wretched seaside hellhole in the spooky mist, at risk of being trampled\
  \ by roaming cows whose roaming brought them, as if by some uncanny cow-controlling\
  \ propulsive force, across the fields to Jaywick, west of Clacton.\n[2008-09-13]"
