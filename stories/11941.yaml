text: "I have paid little attention to the current kerfuffle at the BBC. As stated\
  \ previously, I am intensely relaxed about the fact that some people have far more\
  \ money than I will ever have, and I cannot bestir myself to get in a flap about\
  \ it. It is of course preposterous that the ex-Deputy Director General was given\
  \ a million pound payoff in order to keep him focussed on his decisively important\
  \ work (or words to that affect) but, heigh ho, that is the way of the world and\
  \ to expect any better is to live in a fool's paradise.\nAt the same time, I can\
  \ be roused to a sort of impotent armchair-based fury when these ridiculously overpaid\
  \ persons make public display of their own witlessness and stupidity. Consider Ian\
  \ Katz, lately the deputy editor of the Guardian and now installed as the editor\
  \ of BBC's Newsnight. I do not know how much he is paid but it is no doubt a sum\
  \ beyond my wildest dreams.\nKatz is the latest in a long line of supposedly intelligent\
  \ persons who is unable to master the difference between sending a private message\
  \ and broadcasting it to the entire world. In his editorial role, he apparently\
  \ sent a \u201Ctweet\u201D in which he said a Labour shadow minister was boring\u2014\
  for which he later apologised. Frankly, I couldn't care less. It is the sentence\
  \ that followed the accusation that bothers me. Katz wrote:\nplayout was fun tho,\
  \ wasn't it? telly MUCH better than snooooozepapers innit\nLet me remind you. This\
  \ man was deputy editor of a serious newspaper and is now editor of a flagship current\
  \ affairs programme. No doubt he would say he is being playful and \u201Cironic\u201D\
  . But for him to even think of writing\u2014and then actually to write\u2014such\
  \ infantile twaddle is profoundly depressing.\nKatz should be locked in a cupboard\
  \ with a copy of The Anatomy Of Melancholy, and taken out at intervals to have his\
  \ brain sluiced. Then he might begin to earn a tiny fraction of what he is paid.\n\
