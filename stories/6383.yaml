text: "Far away, out on the desolate moors, in moonlight, the goatherd manqu\xE9 peered\
  \ into the night, lost in thought. Under the same moon, a year ago, he still had\
  \ his goats to herd. But they were taken from him, and he was banished, goatless,\
  \ to wander the moors, wrapped in a tattered and threadbare shawl, to feed off nettles\
  \ and puddlewater, to rue his fate.\nYet on this night, clear and still, with fat\
  \ stars twinkling across the boundless firmament, the bereft goatherd's thoughts\
  \ were not of himself, of his own ruin, but of another. Whatever became, he wondered,\
  \ after his mocking, after the Count's curse, after he was accosted by the assassin\
  \ Sparafucile, after the abduction of Gilda, after being beaten up by courtiers,\
  \ after his vow of revenge, after the parley with Sparafucile and the thunderstorm\
  \ and Gilda's dressing in a man's garb, after receiving the sack, after weighting\
  \ the sack with stones, after opening the sack, after finding the mortally wounded\
  \ Gilda, after her death-groans, whatever became, the goatherd wondered, whatever\
  \ became of the hunchbacked court jester Rigoletto? Rigoletto, his brother?\nHe\
  \ chided himself. \u201CI was too busy with my goats! I cared more for my goats\
  \ than I did for my disfigured brother! And now my niece is dead and my brother\
  \ none knows where. I have lost all, my goats and my niece and my brother. I wander\
  \ these moors, alone, weeping, subsisting on nettles and puddlewater, mocked by\
  \ the moon and the stars. Has any man suffered such torment since Job?\u201D\nThere\
  \ came of a sudden, across the desolation, a response.\n\u201CPossibly not,\u201D\
  \ said a voice. Out of the night, a figure approached the goatherd, the figure of\
  \ a man with flowing locks and a pointy beard, dressed to the nines in an Italianate\
  \ suit, waving a gold-knobbed cane, a true boulevard magnifico uncannily transported\
  \ to the desolate moor.\n\u201CForgive me,\u201D he said, as he reached the patch\
  \ of bracken where the goatherd stood, tragically goatless yet noble, silhouetted\
  \ in the moonlight, \u201CI could not help overhearing your bewailings as I strolled\
  \ stylishly across this desolate moor on this clear still moonlit night. Allow me\
  \ to introduce myself. I am Signor Crepusco. But perhaps you have heard of me?\u201D\
  \nThe goatherd could but grunt.\n\u201CAh well, \u201C said the Signor, \u201CMayhap\
  \ my glittering reputation as a composer of operatic masterpieces has not yet reached\
  \ this land of desolation and nettles and puddles. No matter! Soon it shall, for\
  \ your woebegone blatherings have touched me to the soul, and I intend to write\
  \ an opera about you! Come, goatless yet noble fellow, repair with me to the inn\
  \ where I have taken rooms, and we shall set to work by candlelight!\u201D\nAnd\
  \ thus was hatched the embryo of one of the titanic operatic masterpieces of this\
  \ or any other time, of this or any other planet.\n[2011-04-12]"
