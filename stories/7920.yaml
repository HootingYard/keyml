text: "I make it my habit, on the shortest day of the year, to devise a project which\
  \ will keep me gainfully occupied until the longest day of the year. On the longest\
  \ day of the year, by contrast, I resolve to make no effort to do anything whatsoever\
  \ until the shortest day of the year, thus keeping my life in the proper equilibrium\
  \ as recommended by Bl\xF6tzmann (Second Handbook, Lavender Series).\nToday being\
  \ the shortest day, I have been exercising the cranial integuments to come up with\
  \ something that will not only keep me busy but, I hope, earn me oodles of cash.\
  \ So I have decided to attempt to write a bestseller. Devoted readers will know\
  \ that on occasion I lament what I think of as the \u201Cblinkered airhead\u201D\
  \ approach to publishing in this land, a state of affairs which means that my sweeping\
  \ paragraphs of majestic prose are considered to be \u201Cnot commercially viable\u201D\
  . Like Raymond Roussel, I console myself with the thought that my (posthumous) fame\
  \ will outshine that of Napoleon, and, indeed, of such modern luminaries as Vince\
  \ Cable, Kate Winslet, and Tinie Tempah. In the meantime, however, it seems like\
  \ a good idea to bash out the kind of potboiler that will fly off the shelves of\
  \ airport bookstalls across the globe.\nI know that in order to sell by the million,\
  \ I will need to write something absolutely in tune with the zeitgeist. That is\
  \ why I hit upon the unbeatable idea of a fat novel about a Scandinavian detective\
  \ monkey, to fit in with the current popularity of Scandinavian detective fiction\
  \ and of talking monkeys. I am even thinking of doing a crash course in Swedish\
  \ or Finnish so that I can write my thriller in that language and then have it translated\
  \ back into English for added authenticity.\nMy Scandinavian detective monkey will\
  \ be called Lars Porsena, and it will be a somewhat depressive monkey, perhaps with\
  \ a drink problem and other \u201Cissues\u201D. It will solve a series of crimes\
  \ which take place in snowbound forests, usually in the dark, or at least the twilight.\
  \ I am not much good at making up such scenarios, so what I might do is to read\
  \ dozens of Scandinavian detective thrillers and cobble together some of the crimes,\
  \ and the forests, and the snowdrifts, and then, in sweeping paragraphs of majestic\
  \ prose, insert Lars Porsena the Scandinavian detective monkey into the scenes and\
  \ have him solve the crimes, and swing from tree to tree, and scamper in the snowdrifts,\
  \ while recovering from a hangover or battling one of his other \u201Cissues\u201D\
  .\nThis seems to me a foolproof template for a bestselling potboiler, and I am already\
  \ seeking legal advice about adding a couple of diacritics to my name, so that when\
  \ published, Lars Porsena\_: Scandinavian Detective Monkey will be attributed to\
  \ Fr\xE5nk K\xEBy. Now all I have to do is to learn a Scandinavian language, read\
  \ shelves\u2019-worth of both Scandinavian detective fiction and talking monkey\
  \ fiction, and write the damned thing before the longest day in 2012.\n[2011-12-22]"
