text: "The legend of the smothered chicken of Greaselbow has been told and retold\
  \ for over a thousand years. The core details seldom vary. In the rustic backwater\
  \ of Greaselbow, a child, usually but not always an orphan, is settling in to its\
  \ cot one wild and windy night when it senses an unusual lump under its pillow.\
  \ Lifting the pillow, the child finds a chicken, often but not always a Vanburgh\
  \ chicken, which has expired due to smothering. The child picks up the chicken by\
  \ one of its feet, and chucks it out of the bedroom window. The instant it is let\
  \ go, the chicken springs to life, utters a shrill squawk, and hurtles heavenward.\
  \ When the child returns to bed, it finds the pillow vanished, replaced by a large\
  \ egg. The child climbs into the egg\u2014somehow\u2014and the shell then closes\
  \ around it.\nInterpretations of the legend by folklorists have tended to concentrate\
  \ on the egg and the child, but of more interest is the smothered chicken. That\
  \ is particularly the case if one has a penchant for poultry. And which of us does\
  \ not? Well, you might counter, there are plenty of people who don't give a fig\
  \ about poultry. Even keen egg-eaters, who rarely let a breakfast go by without\
  \ scoffing an egg or two, might be utterly uninterested in the provenance of their\
  \ eggs, id est poultry of one kind or another.\nThis is a lamentable state of affairs,\
  \ and is the reason I carry a pillow with me whenever I am in the vicinity of someone\
  \ eating eggs.\n\u201COi!\u201D, I shout, \u201CWhere did those eggs come from?\u201D\
  \nUnless I receive a full and frank reply, acknowledging the eggs\u2019 origins,\
  \ I bundle the egg-eater to the ground and smother them with the pillow. Oh Lord,\
  \ save us and protect us, for we know not what we do.\nThat was a Thought For The\
  \ Day by the Reverend Joost Van Dongelbraacke, vicar prebendary of St Bibblybibdib's.\n\
