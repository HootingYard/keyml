text: 'I have just started to read The Killing Of Julia Wallace, Jonathan Goodman''s
  account of one of the twentieth century''s most intriguing murder mysteries. The
  events took place in 1931, in Liverpool. Thirty-odd pages in, I have been struck
  by the following:

  One of the key locations is Menlove Avenue, the road where John Lennon grew up.
  The evening before the murder of his wife, William Herbert Wallace played chess
  with a man named McCartney, and on the day of the killing itself, he paid a visit
  to a Mrs Harrison. Alas, the index shows no sign of anyone called Starkey, or Starr.
  Still, three out of four loveable moptops is a pretty good tally so far as meaningless
  yet interesting coincidences go.
