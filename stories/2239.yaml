text: "Once upon a time there was a man who had a dog and the dog bored him senseless.\
  \ Even its unearthly howling, with which it greeted the moon every night, and kept\
  \ up until sunrise, and which drove his neighbours crackers, bored him. When he\
  \ took it for walks in the daylight, and threw sticks for it to fetch, it failed\
  \ to stir his interest. It drooled when chewing on dog biscuits, and as he mopped\
  \ up the drool from the rug, the man sighed and complained about the unutterable\
  \ tedium of his dog. Nobody heard his complaints, for he lived alone with the dog,\
  \ and the dog was deaf.\nEventually the man went to see a dog advice person.\n\u201C\
  I have come to see you because I am bored by my dog,\u201D he said.\n\u201CAh,\u201D\
  \ said the dog advice person, \u201CHave you considered the possibility that you\
  \ have a boring dog?\u201D\nThe man admitted this had not occurred to him.\n\u201C\
  I have always felt that it is me who is at fault,\u201D he said, \u201CI have been\
  \ consumed with fierce self-loathing because I am neither amused nor entertained\
  \ by my dog's howling and stick-fetching and dog biscuit drooling.\u201D\nThe dog\
  \ advice person examined the dog with a scope and a scanner and a probe and other\
  \ instruments from his dog analysis kit. While this was going on, the man leafed\
  \ through the magazines on the dog advice person's coffee table, none of which had\
  \ any dog-related content whatsoever. There were lots of articles about international\
  \ shipping protocols and Antarctic weather stations and derelict railway lines and\
  \ the man became so mentally absorbed in them that the dog advice person had to\
  \ shout at him repeatedly and\_ kick his shins and slap him on the head to gain\
  \ his attention when the examination was over.\n\u201CI can say beyond a shadow\
  \ of a doubt and without fear or favour that you have a boring dog,\u201D he said,\
  \ packing away the instruments in his dog analysis kit and placing it carefully\
  \ in a cupboard.\n\u201CWell, that is a weight off my mind,\u201D said the man.\n\
  He took the dog home. On the way, he threw sticks for it to fetch. Back indoors,\
  \ he gave the dog a dog biscuit to chew on and mopped its drool from the rug without\
  \ complaint. And at nightfall, the dog began its unearthly howling, and the man\
  \ went to bed and slept the sleep of the unweighted mind. He slept so deeply that\
  \ he did not wake up when the neighbours gathered in the moonlight in a ring around\
  \ his house, waving pitchforks, bent on dog death.\n[2009-04-09]"
