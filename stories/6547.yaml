text: "Roll up, see this pig in the balloon basket!\nAny question you have, you must\
  \ ask it.\nWithin its brain sparks'll zag and zig.\nIt is the Intelligent Aerial\
  \ Pig.\nThe balloon is up high so you'll have to shout\nWhatever your query, bawl\
  \ it out.\nThe pig will answer as best it is able\nAnd send its reply down the tethering\
  \ cable.\nIt taps its trotters on one end of the rope,\nOnce for \u201CYes\u201D\
  \ and twice for \u201CNope\u201D\nI feel the vibrations down here on the ground\n\
  And tell you the answer in return for a pound.\nI spend all the profits on pigfeed\
  \ and swill\nBought from the farmyard just past yonder hill.\nThat's where the pig\
  \ has its earthly sty\nWhen not answering questions from its perch in the sky.\n\
  So put your query, hand over your cash,\nBefore the balloon comes down with a crash\n\
  The Intelligent Pig will suffer no harm\nOr, if it does, I shall smear it with balm.\n\
  Balloons tend to plummet if not kept aloft\nBut all will be well if the landing\
  \ is soft\nThat's why I've strewn all these cushions and pillows\nAcross the fields\
  \ as far as those willows\nThe willows that weep, that sob, that bewail\nWhen I\
  \ end up being carted off to gaol\nAccused of being a scoundrel and rotter\nPretending\
  \ to count the taps of a trotter\nThere's no pig up there borne by balloon\nIt's\
  \ as fanciful as the man in the moon\nBut when I get out from my durance vile\n\
  You'll see that my face bears a glittering smile\nI've had an idea that's sure to\
  \ win big\nAn invisible intelligent aerial pig.\n[2011-04-29]"
