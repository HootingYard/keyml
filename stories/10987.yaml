text: "Who was Captain Nitty? Interestingly enough, it is a question that has never\
  \ been asked before. In the long march of humankind, from primeval swamps to space\
  \ age fabness, nobody has ever wanted to know who exactly this Captain Nitty person\
  \ actually was. That should tell us something, but what? It might tell us that Captain\
  \ Nitty was an almost staggeringly insignificant figure. It might tell us that he\
  \ never actually existed and is mere figment.\nNote those figs. Fig-ure, and fig-ment.\
  \ We are all familiar, I think, from our picture books, with \u201CFig. 1\u201D\
  \ or \u201CFig. A.\u201D Sometimes, depending on the nature of the book, a Fig.\
  \ might be a Plate. How much easier it would be to answer our question if we had\
  \ a Fig. or a Plate depicting Captain Nitty. If that were the case, we could simply\
  \ point at the picture and say, \u201CThere! That is Captain Nitty,\u201D and all\
  \ curiosity\u2014if indeed there were any\u2014would be satisfied, and we could\
  \ go off and do something else, something perhaps of more import, such as circumnavigating\
  \ a duckpond, or visiting an owl sanctuary.\nBut, just as nobody has ever cared\
  \ to ask who Captain Nitty was, nor has anybody ever bothered to depict him, whether\
  \ in pen and ink or daubs of paint or by mechanical means such as a camera or Bl\xF6\
  tzmannscope. Even the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint never made a mezzotint of Captain\
  \ Nitty, possibly because nobody was ever prepared to pay the fat fee demanded by\
  \ Rex Tint for one of his mezzotints.\nIn the absence of a Fig. or a Plate, then,\
  \ how are we to go about answering the question? Is there a potted biography to\
  \ which we might refer? \u201CPotted\u201D, in this sense, does not mean literally\
  \ that the biography is to be found planted in a pot, like, say, an aspidistra.\
  \ We must not get in a muddle about all these figs and plates and pots. If we confuse\
  \ them with actual figs, and actual plates, and actual pots, our brains are likely\
  \ to overheat as we struggle to comprehend what we are talking about. If such overheating\
  \ does occur\u2014and there are times when it does, it does\u2014then a circumnavigation\
  \ of the duckpond, or a visit to an owl sanctuary, is a splendid coolant.\nBrain\
  \ duly cooled, however, we are still at something of a loss regarding Captain Nitty,\
  \ as we have discovered, to our horror\u2014and that is not too strong a word\u2014\
  that no potted biography of him exists. We ought of course to realise this. For\
  \ someone to have written a biography, potted or otherwise, they would first have\
  \ had to ask the question \u201CWho was Captain Nitty?\u201D, albeit silently, to\
  \ themselves, and we already know that it is an unasked question.\nThere are of\
  \ course innumerable other questions which have never been asked, ever, by anybody.\
  \ How do you boil an ostrich-head?, for example, or Were the tears of Saint Veronica\
  \ used as a gum for postage stamps? We could witter away until the cows come home\
  \ compiling a list of untold thousands of unasked questions, but to do so would\
  \ bring us no closer to knowing who Captain Nitty was, would it?\n\u201CWould\u201D\
  \ has the same pronunciation as \u201Cwood\u201D, but again we must avoid getting\
  \ all befuddled about wood, as with figs and plates and pots. Generally, we should\
  \ always be on our guard against befuddlement. I should cocoa.\n[2013-02-07]"
