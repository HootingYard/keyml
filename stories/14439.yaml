text: "In the annals of nautical heroism, few men have been as nautically heroic as\
  \ Admiral Bagshawbag of the HMS Crinkle-Cut Oven Chip. Holding sway on the bridge\
  \ of his majestic ship, standing on one leg of flesh and bone and the other of the\
  \ finest mahogany from the Dutch Antilles, a papier m\xE2ch\xE9\_parrot perched\
  \ on his papier m\xE2ch\xE9\_shoulder, his original shoulder having been shot away\
  \ during a particularly violent episode of nautical heroism during a mahogany-gathering\
  \ expedition to the Dutch Antilles a few weeks ago, the Admiral was a man of few\
  \ words.\nOne of those words, and the one he spat out more often than any other,\
  \ was \u201CPiffle!\u201D The Admiral shouted \u201CPiffle!\u201D when he woke up\
  \ in the morning, and he shouted \u201CPiffle!\u201D last thing at night before\
  \ he fell asleep. Between times, holding sway on the bridge of his majestic ship,\
  \ he repeatedly found cause to shout \u201CPiffle!\u201D. The brine-soaked sailors\
  \ of his crew were not always clear why he was shouting \u201CPiffle!\u201D and\
  \ nor, to be fair, was the Admiral himself. It may simply have been a verbal tic,\
  \ if a rather loud and jarring one.\nThe remains of the actual parrot on which the\
  \ papier m\xE2ch\xE9\_one had been modelled were kept in cold storage in the Admiral's\
  \ personal cold storage unit tucked beneath the desk in his cabin. Inside, it was\
  \ colder than the coldest of refrigerators, indeed it was so cold it was scarcely\
  \ believable, from a scientific viewpoint. But the Admiral was not a scientist,\
  \ he was a man of nautical heroism, partly wooden and partly papier m\xE2ch\xE9\_\
  and with one eye made of glass and the fingers of one hand moulded from dough and\
  \ baked to a crisp.\nIn spite of his nautical heroism the Admiral was, to his crew,\
  \ a figure of pity, and not mild pity but a heart-rending extravagant pity provocative\
  \ of strangulated choking sobs and mortification of the bowels. Such pity rendered\
  \ the crew fairly useless in circumstances where nautical heroism was called for,\
  \ for example on mahogany-gathering expeditions to the Dutch Antilles. The Admiral\
  \ tried to pep them up and stiffen their sinews by increasing their rum rations,\
  \ but this served only to make them more mawkish. Several of the crew, in their\
  \ cups, wrote tear-stained letters home to their dear old mothers describing in\
  \ forensic, if intoxicated, detail the pity they felt for their Admiral.\nInside\
  \ its cold storage unit, the parrot was not actually dead. It was in a state of\
  \ suspended animation from which the Admiral planned to revive it, so that one day\
  \ he would be able to perch it on his other shoulder, still\u2014at time of writing\u2014\
  of flesh and bone. To accomplish his plan, the Admiral had set Little Tim the cabin\
  \ boy to a course of study in matters scientific, including cryogenic freezing and\
  \ subsequent thawing. Unfortunately, the only book on board ship was a tattered\
  \ copy of Laughter At The Foot Of The Cross by Michael A Screech, from which several\
  \ crucial pages were missing.\nLittle Tim the cabin boy was the one member of the\
  \ crew who did not pity the Admiral. \u201CI have no time for pity,\u201D he said\
  \ in his high-pitched little voice when interviewed on Dutch Antilles Radio as part\
  \ of a series of interviews with ships\u2019 cabin boys. \u201CI have no time for\
  \ any of the finer emotions,\u201D he continued, \u201CFor I have dedicated my life\
  \ thus far, not that there has been much of it, to preparing myself for future acts\
  \ of nautical heroism, the sort of nautical heroism in which the finer emotions\
  \ can play no part. Now hand me that sextant and that cutlass, so I may practise.\u201D\
  \nAnd so the HMS Crinkle-Cut Oven Chip sails on, either towards or away from the\
  \ Dutch Antilles, with or without a cargo of mahogany. Listen to the wind in the\
  \ rigging. A wind that kills. It kills the crew one by one, until only the Admiral\
  \ and Little Tim the cabin boy and the parrot in cold storage are still with us,\
  \ nautical and heroic, upon a shining sea.\n[2016-01-13]"
