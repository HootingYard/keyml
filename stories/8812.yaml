text: "Forgive me if I lapse into a wee splurge of self-referential twaddle, but I\
  \ thought I would mark the end of the first quarter of the year with a review of\
  \ my daily essays project. Back on the first of January, in On Perpilocution, I\
  \ set myself what I described as a \u201Cfoolhardy\u201D task, to write roughly\
  \ a thousand words a day on whatever topics arrived in my head. I was pretty well\
  \ convinced that this plan would fail, probably about halfway through January. (A\
  \ few years ago, I had the less rigorous ambition of updating Hooting Yard with\
  \ a daily postage, of indeterminate length, and this collapsed early on when I missed\
  \ a day.) So I am mightily surprised to have got through three entire months without\
  \ a hitch.\nOn three occasions, I cheated, in that I reposted older pieces from\
  \ the archive, though in each case they were sufficiently elderly that they may\
  \ well have been new to the less than indefatigable devotee. And one day in February\
  \ I was pleased to offer Hooting Yard space for a guest postage by the blogger BlackberryJuniper\
  \ And Sherbet for her expert analysis of the magnificence of Peter Wyngarde, a topic\
  \ she is far better qualified to address than I am. Other than on those four days,\
  \ I have managed to bash out around a thousand words.\nIncluding those mentioned\
  \ above, the essays covered perpilocution, the moustache of Archduke Stephen, Palatine\
  \ of Hungary, east and west and left and right, potatoes, fogous, naming your child\
  \ after your favourite reservoir, the falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors,\
  \ voodoo athletics, my father, gulls\u2019 eggs, clunks, Skippy the bush kangaroo,\
  \ feral goblins, first encounters, tin foil, apps, control of the fiscal levers,\
  \ Babinsky's idiot half-brother, the Goliath bird-eating spider, Dickensian characters,\
  \ true grit, barking up the wrong tree, government-controlled origami, Porridge\
  \ Island, the devil in the detail, Speed, the Latin Mass and Moby-Dick, quadruple\
  \ points, truculent peasantry, The Love Song Of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, scree,\
  \ blessing cotton socks, the collapse of civilisations, the administration of lighthouses,\
  \ groovy bongos, Balaam and his ass, replacement bus services, \u201Cthe Scottish\
  \ play\u201D, groaning minions, having the prize within one's grasp, nitwits, gods,\
  \ the lambing-hall boogie, Pontiuses, the one-eyed crossing-sweeper of Sawdust Bridge,\
  \ certain books I have read, the magnificence of Peter Wyngarde, sand robots, birds,\
  \ my own Zona, The Wellspring Of Debauchery, a yapping dog and a bramble patch and\
  \ a bog, the dubbin club, jelly, Belgian archery, marshy punting, a darkling plain,\
  \ silent monkey, counting corks, the screaming abdabs, the air, a spook's briefcase,\
  \ etiquette, \u201Con and on and on,\u201D dreams of Pointy Town, chairlift dingbats,\
  \ mods and rockers and widows and orphans, the plains of Gath, curlews, the thing\
  \ that smelled of birds, pickles and pluck and gumption, fate, reggae for swans,\
  \ the newty field, a couple of art exhibitions, Soviet hen coops, certain ants,\
  \ bravura bunkum, Captain Nitty, the bad vicarage, sudden darting movements in the\
  \ insect world, the pecking order, my transformation, bringing the good news from\
  \ Ghent to Aix, the naming of nuts, razzle dazzle and its avoidance, the balletomane\
  \ Nan Kew, King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor, And\
  \ Its Chatelaine, King Jasper's bones, and eggheads. I think there is a pleasing\
  \ variety of subject matter, and I have done my best not to bang on and on about\
  \ the same old guff day in day out.\nI do wonder how many people actually bother\
  \ to read all of these outpourings, and have had a few crises of confidence, when\
  \ siren voices called to me to chuck the whole thing in, and put my feet up, and\
  \ return to conventional itsy bitsy blogging. But, as Outa_Spaceman discovered with\
  \ his cardboard signage project in 2011\u2014which inspired the idea of the daily\
  \ essays\u2014a plan such as this has its own momentum. I reached the point a fair\
  \ few weeks ago where I could not imagine allowing the day to pass without its allotted\
  \ screed.\nTwo things occur to me on looking at that list above. One is that I have\
  \ made use of almost none of the suggestions made by helpful readers in response\
  \ to my plea, in On Perpilocution, to nominate topics I might profitably address.\
  \ This may make me seem dismissive and ungrateful. I am anything but. I am consciously\
  \ keeping many of those suggested titles in reserve. Bear in mind we have three-quarters\
  \ of the year yet to come, and who knows when I might be struck by a more severe\
  \ case of vacancy-between-the-ears than has yet afflicted me? The sense of security\
  \ in having a batch of possible essay titles available to me in times of mental\
  \ befuddlement is most welcome. So thank you\u2014and keep 'em coming!\nThe second\
  \ thing that occurs to me is that it might be interesting to rearrange the essays\
  \ into something approaching alphabetical order, for the forthcoming paperback edition.\
  \ This should be available very shortly, I hope, entitled Hooting Yard Quarterly,\
  \ Volume I Number I, Spring 2012. Alphabetical order would grant the collection\
  \ an encyclopaedic air, and it has long been my ambition to present the world with\
  \ an encyclopaedic body of knowledge wrung from my cranium. This might also help\
  \ me to identify gaps. Well, we shall see what the next quarter of the year brings.\
  \ By the end of June, if all goes according to plan, there should be another ninety-one\
  \ essays, on divers topics, posted here daily.\nDo bear in mind this is serious\
  \ work undertaken in a serious frame of mind, with not a jot of levity.\n[2012-03-31]"
