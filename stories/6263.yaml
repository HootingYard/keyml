text: "\nOver at The Dabbler this week I recall my favourite pedagogue, a chap with\
  \ a jarring speech impediment. A slightly different version of the piece appeared\
  \ here some years ago. One detail that I certainly had no intention of changing,\
  \ for obvious reasons, was the pedagogue's use, for pedagogic purposes, of tonybuzanities.\
  \ These awe-inspiring pedagogic aids are named after Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral\
  \ voice and the flowing black cape\u2014truly a boulevard magnifico, if ever there\
  \ was one, and a magnifico whose brain pulsates at a rate lesser mortals can only\
  \ dream about, while dribbling and grovelling at his feet.\n\n[2011-03-25]"
