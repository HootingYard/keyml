text: "Renaissance\_: noun, from the French for \u201Crebirth\u201D. If you stumble\
  \ upon this word in the course of your reading, you need no longer scratch your\
  \ head in dimwitted befuddlement. Its primary definition is a reference to the occasion,\
  \ in early July in the Year of Our Lord MMXVIII, when the Hooting Yard website,\
  \ having been kaput for some while, came blazing back to life (hence, rebirth) like\
  \ a phoenix rising from the ashes. (If you want to know what a phoenix is, you will\
  \ have to wait for the \u201CP\u201D section of the Hooting Yard Guide To Non-Existent\
  \ Birds.)\n[2018-07-08]"
