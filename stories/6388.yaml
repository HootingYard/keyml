text: "\u2026 the decade being the 1970s, my source again Francis Wheen's Strange\
  \ Days Indeed: The Golden Age Of Paranoia (2009). It is a book of many delights,\
  \ not least the account of the evening of 5th \_April 1976 at 5 Lord North Street,\
  \ the London home of Harold Wilson. Earlier that day, Wilson resigned as prime minister,\
  \ and now he has invited two BBC journalists, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtior,\
  \ to join him for a quiet drink\u2014and to persuade them to investigate the many\
  \ plots against him, variously ascribed to the KGB, the CIA, MI5, or the Post Office,\
  \ perhaps all of them. At one point, Wilson says:\nI see myself as the big fat spider\
  \ in the corner of the room. Sometimes I speak when I'm asleep. You should both\
  \ listen. Occasionally when we meet I might tell you to go to the Charing Cross\
  \ Road and kick a blind man standing on the corner. That blind man may tell you\
  \ something, lead you somewhere.\n\n[2011-04-13]"
