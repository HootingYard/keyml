text: "I have never been much of a joiner. I can count on the fingers of one hand\
  \ the clubs or associations to which I have signed up over the years, and almost\
  \ invariably I have allowed my membership to lapse after the minimum period has\
  \ expired. In the late seventies, however, I actually formed my own organisation.\
  \ There was only one other member, and as far as I can remember it lasted about\
  \ two weeks before being consigned to the dustbin of history. I am not sure what\
  \ made it pop into my head yesterday, for the first time in decades.\nThis short-lived\
  \ yet important society was the Dubbin Club. I am afraid I recall very little about\
  \ it, save that it issued certificates of membership and it was intended that members\
  \ purchase one tin of dubbin each month. I think in total one tin of dubbin was\
  \ bought, shared between the two members, before the club petered out due to lack\
  \ of enthusiasm. It may also be pertinent, in terms of the club's collapse, that\
  \ neither Member Number One (me) nor Member Number Two (my friend David) had any\
  \ pressing need for dubbin, as we were not engaged in any sporting activity for\
  \ which the rubbing of dubbin in to boots would have proved beneficial. In short,\
  \ the Dubbin Club was an ephemeral private amusement between a pair of pals. I would\
  \ not say it is a memory I cherish, and indeed I cannot for the life of me think\
  \ what on earth we were doing, wasting what little cash we had on a polish or unguent\
  \ for which we had not the slightest use. But I suppose I was young, and given to\
  \ preposterousness of one kind and another, and it raised a few laughs at the time.\n\
  Over thirty years later, there is one point about the Dubbin Club that I still understand,\
  \ which is the fact that dubbin is inherently funny. Now, we know from bitter experience\
  \ that any attempt to analyse humour, or to explain a joke, leaches the life out\
  \ of it and leaves it curled up, shrivelled and dead, so I am not going to be so\
  \ foolish as to fret away at the intrinsic amusement value of dubbin. You will either\
  \ share my appreciation or you will not. You will chortle along with me at the sight\
  \ of a tin of dubbin, and at the very sound of the word, or you will not.\nIf, like\
  \ me, you find dubbin amusing, you will be equally likely to see the comedy inherent\
  \ in both swarfega and linseed oil. A few years after the demise of the Dubbin Club,\
  \ I was pleased to note that the Monty Python team recognised the comic value of\
  \ linseed oil, with that splendid line \u201CNow, two boys have been found rubbing\
  \ linseed oil into the school cormorant\u201D from The Meaning Of Life (1983). Obviously\
  \ the school cormorant has a large part to play in our uproarious laughter here,\
  \ but we must not overlook the fact that, of all the goos or unguents or substances\
  \ that could be rubbed in to it, linseed oil is almost certainly the funniest. Though\
  \ I think it is significant that the line still works with dubbin or swarfega substituted\
  \ for linseed oil.\nHaving said that I will not try to analyse the source of my\
  \ hilarity, it does occur to me that both dubbin and linseed oil are intrinsic elements\
  \ in what we might think of as a certain British twentieth century sporting milieu.\
  \ We can imagine baggy-trousered chaps rubbing linseed oil into their cricket bats,\
  \ and rubbing dubbin in to their football boots. These are the same sort of chaps,\
  \ with their clipped accents and emotional repression and thorough decency, who\
  \ amuse us today because, perhaps, they seem so impossibly distant from our own\
  \ barbaric age. It is a vein of humour explored by many, the funny and the hopelessly\
  \ unfunny, over the past fifty years, from Beyond The Fringe onwards. I think we\
  \ ought to acknowledge that dubbin and linseed oil and, to a somewhat lesser extent,\
  \ swarfega are important elements of it.\nThis was surely the\u2014unconscious\u2014\
  motive behind the establishment of the Dubbin Club and its sadly curtailed activities.\
  \ My friend David and I recognised, even if we did not know why, that dubbin was\
  \ not just something that could be bought in a tin and then rubbed into boots, but\
  \ was more than that\u2014a waxy goo that signified a lost world, so the comedy\
  \ was tinged with nostalgia, a nostalgia for a world that, if it ever existed, was\
  \ dying or indeed dead before we were born.\nThe fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol,\
  \ of whose doings you will have read here, belongs to that same era, as I trust\
  \ is evident. Like Tupper of the Track, Bobnit Tivol is a clean-living and morally\
  \ upright athlete, a far cry from the reprehensible scalliwags of today. His fictional\
  \ world is richly infused with dubbin and linseed oil, though for his chosen sporting\
  \ activities he wears spikes rather than football boots, and brandishes a pole-vault\
  \ rather than a cricket bat. His coach and mentor Old Halob, on the other hand,\
  \ comes from a different world, though a roughly contemporaneous one. Old Halob's\
  \ is a world of fog and trenchcoats and Homburg hats and Stalinism. It is in some\
  \ ways a shadow world, the morally ambiguous, shifting and uncertain other side\
  \ to the clean bright decency of the dubbin-and-linseed oil world of gentlemanly\
  \ sport.\nPerhaps it is time I revived the Dubbin Club for the twenty-first century.\
  \ Those of you keen to join may express an interest in the Comments section. If\
  \ sufficient numbers perk up, we can begin long and detailed discussions on such\
  \ matters as the club's constitution, purpose, and activities. Most importantly,\
  \ we should decide on a coat of arms and a Latin motto.\n\n[2012-02-22]"
