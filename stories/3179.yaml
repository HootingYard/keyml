  \ may be the Way Forward\u2026 forward, of course, to that bright upland where I\
  \ can bask under the Aztecs\u2019 mighty orb when my work is done. Even while the\
  \ Key cranium is ticking and whirring as it ponders John Ptak's postage header along\
  \ comes Patrick Kurp at Anecdotal Evidence with \u201CEmptiness; Uncertainty; Inanity\u201D\
  . Again, I advise you to read the original postage, but meanwhile I shall be pondering\
  \ some prose to which it will serve as a fitting title.\nThe \u201Cinanity\u201D\
  \ part should give me no trouble, as virtually any anecdote about Blodgett will\
  \ fit the bill. His tin shadow, his dockside groans, his futile picking at unbuttons\u2026\
  \ there is so much material. \_But \u201Cemptiness\u201D and \u201Cuncertainty\u201D\
  \ may be more troublesome.\nOne uncertainty is to what extent I can get away with\
  \ writing about prose I have not yet written. Best not to dwell upon it, for that\
  \ way emptiness lies.\nADDENDUM\_: As Dave Lull notes in a comment, Patrick Kurp's\
  \ title is a quotation from Dr Johnson's A Dictionary Of The English Language (1755).\
  \ Though that is clear from reading the postage, I ought to have acknowledged it\
