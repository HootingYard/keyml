  \ as\_Simon And Garfunkel Crosse & Blackwell Mr Key and Lepke B. Those who witnessed\
  \ our only ever collaboration at the (now demolished) Jellyfish Theatre in October\
  \ 2010 are still too stunned to speak about it, even in hushed tones.\nNow, the\
  \ legendary duo is reforming for Resonance104.4FM's tenth anniversary party on the\
  \ first of May. We will be on the bill alongside luminaries including Bob Drake\
  \ and Kinnie The Explorer. Full details, including ticket-ordering linkage web-wizardry,\
  \ here.\nI strongly recommend that you attend, and whoop your cheers, and throw\
  \ your hats in the air, and other such expressions of unbridled enthusiasm, including\
  \ swooning with overexcitement.\n[2012-04-16]"
