text: "Magazine's 1978 song \u201CThe Light Pours Out Of Me\u201D is a splendid example\
  \ of a lyric in which the singer claims to have light pouring out of him. A couple\
  \ of others that spring to mind are \u201CSee Me Emit A Remarkable Effulgence\u201D\
  \ by Periodical, and Gazetteer's \u201CI Bear A Striking Resemblance To A Switched\
  \ On Incandescent Lightbulb\u201D. Neither of these had the success of Magazine's\
  \ foray into the genre, perhaps with good reason.\nBy any measure, Magazine's song\
  \ is both musically and lyrically superior. Those of us who have calculated the\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmann units (Second Handbook, Lavender Series) arrive at 14.76 for Magazine,\
  \ 8.35 for Periodical, and a lamentable 2.06 for Gazetteer. It is important to stress\
  \ that Bl\xF6tzmann's is an exact science, so there is no room for manoeuvre.\n\
  In interviews, Periodical's singer and lyricist Hereward Scrimgeour has always insisted\
  \ that \u201CSee Me Emit A Remarkable Effulgence\u201D paints a far more vivid picture\
  \ of light pouring out of himself than Howard Devoto's effort. But the Bl\xF6tzmann\
  \ units do not lie, and one listen to the song after all these years serves to remind\
  \ us why it was roundly ignored. The music is very plinky-plonky. This is not always\
  \ a bad thing, of course, and some plinky-plonky records have been chart hits, or\
  \ at the very least acceptable filler as album tracks. That said, plinky-plonkiness\
  \ is a difficult art to master, as Dobson proved conclusively in his majestic pamphlet\
  \ The Difficulty Of Mastering The Art Of Plinky-Plonky Musical Composition, With\
  \ A Mezzotint Of Chas \u2018n\u2019 Dave (out of print). Dobson argues that the\
  \ balance of plinks and plonks is critical, and it is this balance, I think, or\
  \ the lack of it, that undermines the Periodical piece. At times it is all plinky,\
  \ at others all plonky, and the plinks and plonks never seem to coalesce into plinky-plonkiness\
  \ proper.\nChallenged on this score in a notorious interview by Russell Harty, Hereward\
  \ Scrimgeour babbled some bollocks about Ravel, Buxtehude, and Scriabin before bursting\
  \ into tears, tearing the microphone from his lapel, running out of the studio,\
  \ and flinging himself into a canal, from which he was rescued by screaming teenagers\
  \ who had been encamped outside the television studio, mistaking the Periodical\
  \ front man for Gilbert O'Sullivan, to whom he bore a passing resemblance from a\
  \ certain angle in a certain light on certain days of the week.\nIt is not just\
  \ the flawed plinky-plonkiness of the music, however, but the lyrics too, which\
  \ fail to match up to Magazine's song. Fatally, Scrimgeour seems to have taken as\
  \ his guide that \u201CSee Me, Feel Me, Touch Me\u201D twaddle from The Who's Tommy.\
  \ Indeed, when first he caterwauls the words \u201CSee me \u2026\u201D, and pauses,\
  \ we are startled to think we are listening to Roger Daltrey himself. Scrimgeour\
  \ then tries to jam the words \u201Cemit a remarkable effulgence\u201D into the\
  \ exact same melody as Daltrey's \u201Cfeel me, touch me\u201D. Try it yourself\
  \ and you will appreciate that only a madcap could ever think it would be something\
  \ teenyboppers would want to hear more than once. With the plinks and plonks accompanying\
  \ the words, it really is the most godawful racket.\nWell, perhaps not the most.\
  \ That accolade, if accolade it is, must be reserved for Gazetteer's \u201CI Bear\
  \ A Striking Resemblance To A Switched On Incandescent Lightbulb\u201D. The title\
  \ suggests a novelty record, or one of those disarmingly na\xEFve amateurish postpunk\
  \ ditties which used to amuse us all those years ago. In fact, it is the most godawful\
  \ racket, and determinedly so, a twenty-minute barrage of improvised din produced\
  \ by amplified cheese-graters, coathangers, bags of cement, hammers and nails and\
  \ screwdrivers and funnels and hooters and the Lord knows what else. Accompanying\
  \ this cacophony, Gazetteer's singer and lyricist Harold Stalin alternately shrieks,\
  \ whispers, declaims and mutters a rhyme so foolish it beggars belief. I will not\
  \ try your patience by reproducing the whole thing, but here is a sample:\nI bear\
  \ a striking resemblance to a switched on incandescent lightbulb, yeah?\n  My lightbulb-shaped\
  \ head is entirely bald because this morning I shaved off all my hair.\n  I might\
  \ do the whole thing again later.\n  Take it away, amplified cheese-grater!\n  [Solo]\n\
  Harold Stalin took his amplified cheese-grater with him when he made an appearance\
  \ on Russell Harty Plus, a week after Hereward Scrimgeour had fled the studio. A\
  \ more convincing interviewee than the Periodical singer, Stalin charmed Harty with\
  \ a series of verbal sallies that seemed incongruous coming from the mouth of such\
  \ an idiotic lyricist. He demonstrated wit, verve, erudition, and a kind of gumption,\
  \ all in the space of five minutes. Harty was so bowled over he asked if he could\
  \ have a go with the cheese-grater. Fiddling about with the attached wiring just\
  \ before passing it to the chatshow host, Harold Stalin got his sockets mixed up\
  \ and managed to electrocute himself. He survived the accident, but was never quite\
  \ the same. He certainly lost his wit, verve, erudition and kind of gumption. He\
  \ disbanded Gazetteer and formed a new group, adopting a new pseudonym, and went\
  \ on to huge international success followed by lute-playing. As far as I am aware\
  \ he still goes under the same name, which I think is \u201CString\u201D, or something\
  \ like that.\nThere are several other songs in which the singer claims to have light\
  \ pouring out of him, but they are quite difficult to track down. Dobson wrote a\
  \ pamphlet about his own, tireless, efforts to do so, to which he gave the title\
  \ Lead, Kindly Light, To Bald Men Wearing Specs (out of print). If ever you stumble\
  \ upon a copy in a secondhand pamphlet shop, be very very careful. Marigold Chew\
  \ devised a special cover which, when opened, reveals a blinding incandescent light\
  \ not unlike that which shines forth from the mysterious case in Kiss Me Deadly\
  \ (Robert Aldrich, 1955), starring Ralph Meeker and Cloris Leachman.\n\n[2012-07-25]"
