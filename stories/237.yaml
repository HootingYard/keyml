text: "Dr Johnson (a sort of proto-Dobson) famously stated that when a man is tired\
  \ of London he is tired of life. On the other hand, when a man is tired of Hooting\
  \ Yard (not that such a mental aberration is remotely credible, of course) there\
  \ are other Yards he can investigate. I have just returned from a stay in Whitby,\
  \ where, among other Yards, I was happy to spot both Dark Entry Yard and Arguments\
  \ Yard. Whitby is all Yards and Steps. Of the latter, the one hundred and ninety-nine\
  \ steps leading up to the ruined Abbey are the most noteworthy, but there are plenty\
  \ of less celebrated Steps to clamber up and down, many of then perilous and steep.\n\
  Dark Entry Steps can be found opposite the railway station, which has a somewhat\
  \ battered and semi-derelict air, and has but a single platform and a single track,\
  \ on which a train plies between Whitby and Middlesbrough, back and forth all day,\
  \ but not at night.\nMy little trip to Whitby goes some way to explaining the eerie\
  \ silence that has crept over Hooting Yard of late. But I am back again now, revivified,\
  \ and will be posting a few more dispatches regarding \u201CSeaside Resort Of The\
  \ Year, 2006\u201D in addition to the usual morally uplifting and instructive prose.\
  \ So you can look forward to reading about the Scoresby Pump, Goth tat, a CCTV warning\
  \ in Celtic uncials (in yet another Yard), the Whitby Literary & Philosophical Society,\
  \ pipistrelles, and much else. Oh, and by the way, the offer may not last long,\
  \ but one shop in that delightful town is currently giving away a free bra with\
  \ every pair of flipflops sold. On second thoughts, I think I am misremembering\
  \ that, and it's the other way round.\n[2007-08-26]"
