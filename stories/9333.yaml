text: "As a child, I gained my first understanding of the grand sweep of our national\
  \ story from a book entitled British History In Strip Pictures, undated, but published\
  \ by Odhams Press at some point in the 1950s. I used to pore over this book for\
  \ hours, and was going to pore over it again, preparatory to writing today's essay.\
  \ Alack and alas!, I am mortified that I cannot find it on the tottering teeming\
  \ Hooting Yard bookshelves. Now I am not exactly the most organised of persons,\
  \ but I can usually lay hands on a book I am looking for. The current whereabouts\
  \ of British History In Strip Pictures must, for the time being, remain a mystery.\
  \ I know I have it somewhere.\nNot being able to find it, I was going to postpone\
  \ this essay for another day. But then I determined to soldier on, as my subject\
  \ would have soldiered on, determinedly, and regardless of handicap. My handicap\
  \ is merely that I cannot find the book I was looking for. His handicap was that\
  \ he was blind. For I speak of that titanic figure Blind Jack of Knaresborough.\n\
  \nIn British History In Strip Pictures, Blind Jack was granted a whole page, the\
  \ same amount of space given to, for example, the Magna Carta, Shakespeare, and\
  \ the Civil War, and twice that given to Gladstone and Disraeli, who had to share\
  \ a page, as I recall. I thus grew up with the idea that Blind Jack of Knaresborough\
  \ was a pivotal figure in British history. I fully expected, when I went to school\
  \ and studied these matters in greater depth, that Blind Jack would probably have\
  \ a few lessons devoted solely to his doings, if not an entire term's worth. As\
  \ it turned out, in thirteen years at school, from age five to eighteen, I do not\
  \ think I ever heard his name mentioned.\nAt some point the sheer wrongness of this\
  \ must have occurred to me, along with the thought that perhaps the editors at Odhams\
  \ Press had made him up for a lark. \u201CTee hee! Let's insert a page about a wholly\
  \ convincing yet completely fictional character to play a trick on the tinies!\u201D\
  , I imagined a couple of them, resembling Gabbitas and Thring from the Molesworth\
  \ books, chuckling to each other over their printers\u2019 proofs. Such scampishness\
  \ could be the only explanation for my history teachers\u2019 neglect of the man\
  \ I believed had single-handedly brought about the Industrial Revolution. I had\
  \ been led to believe that, were it not for Blind Jack of Knaresborough, we might\
  \ still be living in rustic squalor, a nation of peasants consigned forever to remain\
  \ in Lork Roise because we would never have been able to travel to Candleford.\n\
  Blind Jack, you see, was a road builder. And the way he built roads, British History\
  \ In Strip Pictures told me, was that he walked along tapping his stick in front\
  \ of him to gauge the smoothness and straightness of the road he had just built\u2026\
  \ er\u2026 something along those lines, they had but six pictures and captions to\
  \ tell the story, so obviously some of the finer detail was left out. I recall being\
  \ haunted by the picture of Blind Jack out on the road, dressed just like the man\
  \ on the Quaker Oats carton, gazing at nothing. I am sure there were times when\
  \ I dreamed of him, relentlessly approaching me, the tap of his stick, the eerie\
  \ sightlessness of his eyes\u2026 I think for a time I even managed to get him mixed\
  \ up, in my fevered mind, with the much more malign figure of Robert Mitchum's preacher\
  \ man in The Night Of The Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955), which I saw when very\
  \ young and impressionable.\nWithout having the book to hand, I am unable to confirm\
  \ whether it mentioned other titans of the Industrial Revolution such as Thomas\
  \ Telford and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. I am fairly sure that neither of them had\
  \ a whole page to himself. Blind Jack did, and that was good enough for me to credit\
  \ him with creating a world that lifted me out of peasantry. And to my relief, I\
  \ have since learned that he was not an invention of a couple of scallywags at Odhams\
  \ Press, that he really did exist.\nHis name was John Metcalf, born 1717 and died\
  \ in 1810, blind from the age of six.. One of the intriguing things about him was\
  \ that part of his success in building roads was a matchless ability to make accurate\
  \ estimations of costs and materials, using a system of his own devising which he\
  \ was unable (or unwilling?) ever to explain to others. He also worked out a method\
  \ of constructing \_roads over bogs, using matted rafts of marsh grass and furze.\
  \ No wonder he is my hero, when we consider that that previous sentence alone contains\
  \ at least three words essential to the Hooting Yard lexicon.\nHis gravestone, in\
  \ the Yorkshire village of Spofforth, bears this epitaph:\nHere lies John Metcalf,\
  \ one whose infant sight\n    Felt the dark pressure of an endless night;\n    Yet\
  \ such the fervour of his dauntless mind,\n    His limbs full strung, his spirits\
  \ unconfined,\n    That, long ere yet life's bolder years began,\n    The sightless\
  \ efforts mark'd th\u2019 aspiring man;\n    Nor mark'd in vain\u2014high deeds\
  \ his manhood dared,\n    And commerce, travel, both his ardour shared.\n    'Twas\
  \ his a guide's unerring aid to lend\u2014\n    O'er trackless wastes to bid new\
  \ roads extend;\n    And, when rebellion reared her giant size,\n    'Twas his to\
  \ burn with patriot enterprise;\n    For parting wife and babes, a pang to feel,\n\
  \    Then welcome danger for his country's weal.\n    Reader, like him, exert thy\
  \ utmost talent given!\n    Reader, like him, adore the bounteous hand of Heaven\n\
  ADDENDUM\_: I wonder if Anna Pavlova named her swan after Blind Jack of Knaresborough?\
  \ Perhaps a balletomane reader might know, and could enlighten me.\n[2012-05-30]"
