text: "\u201CThe Fatal Dowry has been cobbled, I see, by some purblind ultra-crepidarian\
  \ -McCready's friend, Walker, very likely; but nevertheless, I maintain 'tis a good\
  \ play, and might have been rendered very effective by docking it of the whole fifth\
  \ act, which is an excrescence,\u2014re-creating Novall, and making Beaumelle a\
  \ great deal more ghost-gaping and moonlightish. The cur-tailor has taken out the\
  \ most purple piece in the whole web\u2014the end of the fourth Act\u2014and shouldered\
  \ himself into toleration through the prejudices of the pit, when he should have\
  \ built his admiration on their necks. Say what you will, I am convinced the man\
  \ who is to awaken the drama must be a bold trampling fellow, no creeper into worm-holes,\
  \ no reviver even, however good. These reanimations are vampire-cold. Such ghosts\
  \ as Marloe, Webster &c. are better dramatists, better poets, I dare say, than any\
  \ contemporary of ours, but they are ghosts; the worm is in their pages; and we\
  \ want to see something that our great-grandsires did not know. With the greatest\
  \ reverence for all the antiquities of the drama, I still think that we had better\
  \ beget than revive; attempt to give the literature of this age an idiosyncrasy\
  \ and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to gaze on, not to live with\u2014\
  just now the drama is a haunted ruin.\u201D\nThomas Lovell Beddoes (1803\u20131849),\
  \ letter to Thomas Forbes Kelsall, 11 January 1825\n[2010-08-10]"
