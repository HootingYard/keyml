text: "Sag\u2019 mir, wo die Blumen sind? I can scarcely credit that over a quarter\
  \ of a century has passed since I wrote, illustrated, photocopied, folded, collated,\
  \ stapled, signed and numbered fifty copies of The Churn In The Muck. Now, this\
  \ spineless out of print pamphlet will set you back \xA393. That's how much a copy\
  \ is selling for on eBay.\n\nWhat do you get for your cash? \u201CVintage Frank\
  \ Key surrealist writing, in a booklet that contains 4 pages of wallpaper sample\
  \ and 4 pages of tracing paper. There is a murderous rivalry over an Icelandic fontoon\
  \ buried at the bottom of a lake. Indefatigable Hungarian detective Bulent Hellbag\
  \ arrives on the scene to solve the case\u201D, according to Serendipity Bookstore\
  \ in the far Antipodes. I should point out that, in addition to the wallpaper and\
  \ tracing paper, there are actually pages of text, too. (I am not sure the blurb\
  \ makes that quite clear.)\n[2014-01-27]"
