text: "A letter arrives from Christopher Lamere in New England. (I note, incidentally,\
  \ that Mr Lamere's name is an anagram of H[is] R[oyal] H[ighness] Elastic Emperor,\
  \ though this may not be significant.)\nDear Mr. Key\nI want you to know that you\
  \ are my favorite writer. This may seem like a vast honor for a no-name, penniless,\
  \ friendless failure of a 25 year old to bestow, but it is God's truth. The imagery\
  \ which you conjure gives me chills. The truths you tell with your stories fascinate\
  \ and disturb me, especially because I often initially read your tales as flights\
  \ of fancy instead of actual true events. As a resident of New England, your descriptions\
  \ of far away ye Olde England are unnerving portraits of a distant land which my\
  \ home tries to imitate.\nImagine my surprise then, while wandering through some\
  \ not very dense woods which as an American I would never call a spinney, I found\
  \ myself at the edge of a wooden lake. At first, I was convinced that the plank\
  \ upon plank of maple wood was merely the foundation for some as yet unconstructed\
  \ building, but when I pressed my ear to the varnished surface, I heard that interminable\
  \ sloshing of some hidden beast. I was shocked to find that your story of the wooden\
  \ lake was not a mere fantasy, but an ominous story of hidden portent.\nIt's the\
  \ most frustrating thing in the world, since it seems like a conspiracy which I\
  \ was excluded from. Even with words whispered between my close friends, when I\
  \ broach the subject of vast lake monsters, or even the mere idea of lakes hidden\
  \ by wood, their whole demeanor changes. It's as if they've never heard of a lake,\
  \ or monsters, or wood, or even nails. While I have not been ejected from my town\
  \ as of yet, people tend to narrow their eyes and hiss \u201Coutsider\u201D when\
  \ I come around. What should I do? I don't own a hammer, and there is no duckpond\
  \ in my town.\nYours in fear,\nChristopher Lamere\nHave no fear, Mr Lamere! I have\
  \ given much thought to what you should do in order to avoid otherwise inevitable\
  \ gruesome consequences. First, make a magnetic tape-recording of the hissing sounds\
  \ made by your townsfolk. Under cover of darkness, subject the tape to certain blasphemous\
  \ manipulations, then use rusty blood-caked garden shears to cut it and form it\
  \ into a loop, such that, when played, it will repeat after approximately thirteen\
  \ seconds. Take it to the precise centre of the wooden lake and play it through\
  \ an enormous loudspeaker or electric hooter at deafening volume. Have to hand a\
  \ supply of pebbles which you can hurl at any townsfolk who approach, intent on\
  \ silencing you. As the godawful hiss resounds across the wooden lake and into the\
  \ dense woods, execute a tableau vivant of a historical or mythological theme\u2014\
  Judith with the head of Holofernes would be apt, or perhaps President Nixon holding\
  \ his arms aloft just before boarding the helicopter on the White House lawn that\
  \ ferried him to retirement. From time to time, increase the volume of the hissing\
  \ tape loop. Before several days have passed, your lack of a hammer and a duckpond\
  \ will count for nothing. And, as I so often say when dispensing advice, irrespective\
  \ of the nature of that advice, remember to wear gloves.\n[2014-12-08]"
