text: "I haven't read anything by J G Ballard since I was a teenager. Nor have I read,\
  \ or enjoyed, much science fiction. A simple statement by Ballard, filmed in 2006\
  \ and shown on a Channel Four News obituary last night, makes me suspect I've been\
  \ missing something. He said:\n\u201CThe great thing about science fiction is that\
  \ nobody lives in Hampstead.\u201D\nCompare and contrast with this extract from\
  \ a book review by some airhead a few years ago, which I shall have to paraphrase\
  \ because I cannot track down the exact quote:\n\u201CThis is a perfectly-observed\
  \ portrait of North London literary life, with such telling details as the copy\
  \ of the weekend Guardian Guide on the coffee table.\u201D\nI don't recall which\
  \ novel was under review, but it could have been one among hundreds, couldn't it?\n\
