text: "The OED defines jiggery-pokery as \u201Cdeceitful or dishonest \u2018manipulation\u2019\
  ; hocus-pocus, humbug\u201D. By OED, I mean the Oxford English Dictionary of course,\
  \ the common referent of that abbreviation. The out of print pamphleteer Dobson,\
  \ however, tried to foist upon the world another OED, the Omni-Encyclopaedia Dobsonia.\
  \ We must be careful, when ploughing through the works of the pamphleteer, not to\
  \ mistake one OED for the other. If we look up \u201Cjiggery-pokery\u201D in Dobson's\
  \ own OED, we are told simply, \u201Csee pamphlet\u201D. In fact, pretty much anything\
  \ we look up in Dobson's OED carries the same advice or instruction. It is difficult\
  \ to see the point of this so-called reference work, which consumed many, many hours\
  \ of the pamphleteer's time. Even if we consider it as a sort of universal index\
  \ to the contents of his pamphlets, it is by and large worthless, as he never deigns\
  \ to inform us which particular pamphlet he is enjoining us to \u201Csee\u201D.\n\
  In the case of jiggery-pokery, though, we are on firm ground. The pamphlet to which\
  \ the OEDobsonia refers must be The History, Theory And Practice Of Jiggery-Pokery,\
  \ From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With Practical Tips And Cut Out \u2018\
  N\u2019 Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your Mantelpiece (out of print). At barely\
  \ a dozen pages, the pamphlet is distressingly brief, and nowhere does Dobson grant\
  \ us a definition, so we are never entirely clear what he means, or understands,\
  \ by the term \u201Cjiggery-pokery\u201D. There is one lengthy paragraph which seeks\
  \ to describe, in mind-numbing detail, a series of \u201Cmanipulations\u201D, \u201C\
  passing movements\u201D, \u201Cflummeries and gesticulations\u201D and \u201Choo-hah\u201D\
  \ which the pamphleteer watched being performed by a man he describes as \u201C\
  a shattered ship's captain\u201D on board a boat plying an unidentified sound on\
  \ New Year's Eve 1949. If we accept this to be a description of jiggery-pokery,\
  \ we are none the wiser regarding its purpose, as Dobson does not bother to tell\
  \ us. One suspects he had no idea what he was looking at.\nThe pamphlet's title\
  \ makes great claims, which only the most charitable reader could consider are met.\
  \ History? Well, Dobson has a couple of sentences in which he makes glancing reference\
  \ to \u201Cwell-known instances of jiggery-pokery by Lars Porsena of Clusium and\
  \ one-eyed Horatius Cocles\u201D and to \u201Cthat funny business involving a certain\
  \ Frankish king\u201D, but we are left scratching our heads wondering what on earth\
  \ he is talking about. I just scratched my head, incidentally, and a beetle fell\
  \ out of my bouffant. Time to wash my hair with a proprietary shampoo! Wait there.\n\
  I have returned, cleaned and preened and ready to proceed. Where were we? Ah yes.\
  \ If the \u201Chistory\u201D element of the pamphlet's title is scarcely justifiable,\
  \ what about \u201Ctheory\u201D? On page five, Dobson announces, with quiet menace,\
  \ \u201CThe time has come to consider jiggery-pokery in the abstract\u201D. This\
  \ is menacing because anybody who has even a passing acquaintance with the pamphleteer's\
  \ work knows that when he embarks upon passages of \u201Cabstraction\u201D the best\
  \ thing to do is to bash one's head repeatedly against a surface of adamantine hardness\
  \ until one loses consciousness. There was a time, when I was foolishly attempting\
  \ to write a magazine article entitled \u201CAbstract Dobson\u201D, when I actually\
  \ installed a rectangular panel of granite next to my writing desk, so I could do\
  \ the bashing without having to get up from my chair. If you fear your cranium cannot\
  \ withstand repeated bashing, it is important to find an alternative method of dealing\
  \ with the all too potent horrors of Dobson in \u201Cabstract\u201D mode. Some illegal\
  \ pharmacists with pharmacies tucked away down sordid alleyways may be able to procure\
  \ for you the kinds of powdered tranquilisers that can stun an entire herd of cattle,\
  \ but ingesting them, even in a bergamot-scented tisane, has its own risks. Some\
  \ more experienced Dobsonists have tried the trick of simply flipping past the awful\
  \ pages and resuming their reading when the pamphleteer gets some sense back in\
  \ his head. Do what you have to do.\nFor now, all I will say about Dobson's \u201C\
  Theory of Jiggery-Pokery\u201D is\u2026 glubb\u2026 glubb\u2026glubb-glubb. Some\
  \ of you will recognise that as the telephone call made by a terrifying semi-aquatic\
  \ creature in The Thing On The Doorstep by H P Lovecraft. Warning enough, I think.\n\
  And so we come to \u201CPractice\u201D, which I suppose Dobson addresses in that\
  \ interminable paragraph about the shattered ship's captain, but as we have seen,\
  \ whether what he witnessed was jiggery-pokery, or some kind of maritime ballet,\
  \ is by no means clear. Over the years I have watched various crew members of ships,\
  \ from Rear Admirals to barnacle scrapers, perform all sorts of baffling physical\
  \ manoeuvres, and not once have I thought any of it fitted the definition of jiggery-pokery,\
  \ except on one occasion when I was aboard a very sinister ship which sailed into\
  \ a clammy mist, in which all sorts of ugly shenanigans took place until, at the\
  \ last, I was marooned, with several other paying passengers, upon a remote atoll,\
  \ populated only by squelchy creeping things, and bereft of paper and pencils and\
  \ writing desks and panels of adamantine hardness. Luckily, the one, brine-soaked,\
  \ Dobson pamphlet I managed to salvage from the ship was written in his more familiar\
  \ majestic sweeping paragraphs, with nary a pippet of \u201Cabstraction\u201D within\
  \ it. Its title, by the way, was Popular Games And Pastimes Suitable For Those Marooned\
  \ On Remote Atolls Pending Rescue By A Ship Of Fools (out of print).\nReturning\
  \ to the pamphlet under discussion, my copy of The History, Theory And Practice\
  \ Of Jiggery-Pokery, From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With Practical\
  \ Tips And Cut Out \u2018N\u2019 Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your Mantelpiece\
  \ contains neither practical tips nor cut out \u2018n\u2019 keep cardboard display\
  \ models for my mantelpiece, not that I have a mantelpiece in my chalet, for architectural\
  \ reasons. I suspect Dobson appended these items to his title to woo a wider readership,\
  \ attracting the kinds of people who like practical tips and the construction of\
  \ cardboard display models. I once cut out, from a Kellogg's cornflakes carton,\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 constructed \u2018n\u2019 kept, a cardboard display model of the\
  \ head, just the head, of Henry VIII. But that was long ago, when I was young and\
  \ tiny, and almost as long ago it was lost. Both are lost, the time of my youth\
  \ and the cardboard head, lost too, one suspects, the wits of Dobson when he sat\
  \ down to write his jiggery-pokery pamphlet. Perhaps that was his own kind of jiggery-pokery,\
  \ as a pamphleteer, to convince us he was a sensible man writing sensible prose,\
  \ when more often than not he was a nincompoop.\n[2010-09-23]"
