text: "\u201CThe annotation has been carried out on a scale which is necessarily extensive\
  \ but which seeks at the same time to be as economical as possible in face of the\
  \ twin challenges of Browning's wide range of curious information and his immense\
  \ and flexible vocabulary. Without the prior labours of A K Cook to draw upon, preparation\
  \ of the body of notes would have been an even more formidable task than it in fact\
  \ was. Despite all that has been transported to the present site from Cook's Commentary,\
  \ a great deal of ore remains in that capacious mine.\u201D\nSo wrote Richard D\
  \ Altick in his introduction to the Penguin English Poets edition of Robert Browning's\
  \ The Ring And The Book, which appeared in 1971. Curiously, in the very same year,\
  \ exactly the same words were used\u2014with \u201CDobson\u201D instead of \u201C\
  Browning\u201D, and \u201CPebblehead\u201D in place of \u201CCook\u201D\u2014in\
  \ the first edition of the mighty Complete Annotated Dobson edited by Ted Cack.\
  \ The title was a misnomer, of course, because at that time Dobson still had a few\
  \ years left, during which he penned some of his most awe-inspiring pamphlets. In\
  \ fact recent Dobsonian scholarship has shown that, if anything, Cack's tome might\
  \ better have been called the Thoroughly Incomplete Annotated Dobson. That is not\
  \ to cast aspersions on what remains a truly engaging work, and the first serious\
  \ attempt to annotate Dobson in a systematic way.\nThe Pebblehead Cack refers to,\
  \ the author of the \u201Ccapacious mine\u201D of Commentary wherein lies a great\
  \ deal of ore yet to be recovered, was the father of Pebblehead the writer of all\
  \ those bestselling paperbacks you find at airport bookstalls. It is regrettable\
  \ in some ways that the achievements of Pebblehead p\xE8re have been roundly eclipsed\
  \ by the fame of Pebblehead fils, to the point where, today, the old man's majestic\
  \ Commentary on Dobson is forgotten by all but a few, and those few all in their\
  \ dotage, dribbling and drooling, brains wizened and minds twitching and shattered.\
  \ Ted Cack's work, too, which as he acknowledges draws so heavily upon the elder\
  \ Pebblehead, seems destined for the scrapheap, not least because the younger Pebblehead,\
  \ king of the paperback potboiler, seems bent on obliterating all printed traces\
  \ of his pa. He uses the considerable wealth he has accrued from the transient guff\
  \ he peddles to buy up and burn on bonfires not just his pa's own work, but any\
  \ books, periodicals, journals, chapbooks, pamphlets, videocassettes and DVDs which\
  \ so much as mention his name.\nIt is not for me to propose a psychological explanation\
  \ for this preposterous campaign of Pebblehead's, which smacks of atavistic impulse\
  \ and ancient myth. Plenty of amateurs have tried their hands at doing so, with\
  \ laughable results. Only last week there was some codswallop in the Daily Unhingement,\
  \ claiming that an incident from the younger Pebblehead's infancy, involving a sewing\
  \ kit, a swarm of Africanised killer bees, and a newspaper report of the Munich\
  \ Air Disaster, was at the root of the matter. As usual, there was no proof, no\
  \ evidence, merely the blithering of a witless hack trying to jump-start their career.\n\
  As a corrective to such drivel, I have decided to set up a fighting fund to rescue\
  \ the work of Pebblehead p\xE8re from oblivion, while simultaneously urging a boycott\
  \ of Pebblehead fils\u2019 bestselling paperbacks. Among those already signed up\
  \ are Carlos Santana, Lembit Opik, Dale Winton, Dustin Hoffman, and some of the\
  \ top names in football, including Tord Grip, Pantsil, Crouch and Kaka. I hope you\
  \ will join them.\n[2007-05-27]"
