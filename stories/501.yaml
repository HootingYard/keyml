  \ pleasure), just treat them as phrases cut loose from any context, in which case\
  \ they can act as starting points for pieces of prose.\n\u201CPrince enters flat\
  \ of major\u201D was one of the clues in yesterday's Guardian crossword, and I wrote\
  \ a short piece inspired by it.\nPrince Fulgencio's entourage\u2014all clanking\
  \ armour and burnished golden helmets\u2014gathered in the corridor outside the\
  \ dingy flat wherein Major Blenkinsop lurked. The brevet captain of the entourage\
  \ rapped on the door, thrice, before the more brutish and sullen members of the\
  \ entourage kicked it down and stomped into the flat, roaring their heads off and\
  \ unleashing a flock of half-starved starlings to sow havoc and confusion. Thus\
  \ was the necessary atmosphere created for Prince Fulgencio's entrance. He had come\
  \ to have breakfast with the Major, and wanted to eat his cornflakes and doughballs\
  \ while watching starlings peck the wallpaper off the walls. That was the kind of\
  \ Prince he was, especially at breakfast time.\n[2008-08-06]"
