text: 'The Independent reports on some very sensible new rules issued by the Vatican
  to deal with people who have visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or BVM.

  Anyone who claims to have seen an apparition [of the Virgin Mary] will only be believed
  as long as they remain silent and do not court publicity over their claims. If they
  refuse to obey, this will be taken as a sign that their claims are false.

  The visionaries will then be visited by a team of psychiatrists, either atheists
  or Catholics, to certify their mental health while theologians will assess the content
  of any heavenly messages to see if they contravene Church teachings.

  If the visionary is considered credible they will ultimately be questioned by one
  or more demonologists and exorcists to exclude the possibility that Satan is hiding
  behind the apparitions in order to deceive the faithful.

  I have put my name forward as a volunteer outreach demonologist for the new scheme.
  Peeking behind apparitions to check for the presence or absence of Satan is, after
  all, a long-standing hobby of mine, and I think I have the required skills-set.
  I would also perform my demonology duties in a robust and transparent manner, or
  in a weedy and opaque manner if that is what the Vatican would prefer.
