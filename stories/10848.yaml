text: "\nOver at The Dabbler today, a bonus extra diary entry, for this day nineteen\
  \ years ago, written by a nonagenarian Russian exile in Spain. Anthony Burgess is\
  \ mentioned in the text, which gives me an excuse to remind you lot of his biographer\
  \ Roger Lewis\u2019 matchless description of the Mancunian polymath's hair:\nAnd\
  \ how are we going to describe his hair? The yellowish-white powdery strands were\
  \ coiled on his scalp like Bram Stoker's Dracula's peruke, not maintained since\
  \ Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off the Turks in the Carpathian mountains in 1462.\
  \ What does it say about a man that he could go around like that, as Burgess did?\
  \ Though he was a king of the comb-over (did the clumps and fronds emanate from\
  \ his ear-hole?), no professional barber can be blamed for this. I thought to myself,\
  \ he has no idea how strange he is. What did he think he looked like? He evidently\
  \ operated on his own head with a pair of garden shears.\n\n[2013-01-18]"
