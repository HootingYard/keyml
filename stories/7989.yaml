text: "\nIn the dying days of the twelvemonth, you can barely open a newspaper or\
  \ magazine, watch the television or listen to the radio without being confronted\
  \ by yet another \u201CReview Of The Year\u201D or \u201CRound-Up Of The Key Events\
  \ Of 2011\u201D. Blather blather blather. The thing about these space-fillers is\
  \ that they tend to be cobbled together on the hoof, with little thought, and\u2014\
  understandably, I suppose\u2014lack any proper historical perspective. What seems\
  \ important to hacks as the year takes its last gasps may, in fifty or a hundred\
  \ years\u2019 time, be quite forgotten, and 2011 may be remembered for other events\
  \ entirely, ones which, to us who lived through them, seem trivial and unworthy\
  \ of remark.\nSo when I was commissioned by the editors of The Dabbler to write\
  \ my own review of 2011, I put on my futurologist's cap (satin and wool, tassles,\
  \ earflaps) and, with the aid of Dr Baxter's Invigorating Brain Syrup, I looked\
  \ at the year through the eyes of a Man Of The Future. What would a penniless out\
  \ of print scribbler of 2111 pick out as the crucial events of 2011? My report is\
  \ here.\nMeanwhile, having got quite a taste for the wearing of the cap and the\
  \ glugging of the syrup, I am heading further into the future. I have set the controls\
  \ for 2525, the year of Zager & Evans\u2019 imperishable chart-topper, and will\
  \ let you know how I get on.\n[2011-12-30]"
