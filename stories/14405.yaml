text: "Last night I dreamt I wrote Light Shining In Buckinghamshire. My version was\
  \ completely different to the original \u2013 an anonymous Digger tract of 1648\u2014\
  though it was written in archaic prose and contained a plethora of commas. Indeed,\
  \ it contained many, many more commas than I would ever be likely to deploy, all\
  \ things considered, when acting in the waking world, so much duller, most of the\
  \ time, than the phantasmal world of sleep, and by acting, of course, I mean writing,\
  \ the act of writing, in prose, with commas, but, boy oh boy, not half as many commas\
  \ as I, or rather the dream me, managed to pack in, furiously, so many they were\
  \ tripping each other up, almost, in Light Shining In Buckinghamshire, the dream\
  \ version. That sentence may be grammatically compromised, but that is the price\
  \ you pay for a plethora of commas.\nMy text was hand-written, and it was clear,\
  \ or dream-clear, that it would remain as an edition of one. Nevertheless, I got\
  \ the strong impression that my Light Shining In Buckinghamshire was considered\
  \ by readers to be the best thing I had ever written. I am not sure how I gained\
  \ this impression, but, you know, dreams are dreams. It is a pity, then, that I\
  \ cannot remember, in the waking world, a single word of the text. All I recall\
  \ is the archaic prose and those damned commas.\nI am now planning to pay a visit\
  \ to Buckinghamshire, and to study the light, and to make copious notes on the light\
  \ in my pocketbook with my propelling pencil and then, upon my return from Buckinghamshire,\
  \ to parlay those notes into a piece of majestic prose, hand-written, in an edition\
  \ of one. I will let you know when I am done, and you may make an appointment to\
  \ come and read it.\n[2016-01-04]"
