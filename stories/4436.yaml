text: "I hid some cake inside a box. I hid the box behind a hedge. The hedge was clipped\
  \ by a snag-toothed peasant, using a rusty pair of shears. He'd left the shears\
  \ out overnight, leaning against the side of a barn. In the middle of the night,\
  \ there came an enormous cloudburst. It was a downpour the like of which leads to\
  \ floods and puddles. So busy was the peasant, over the next days, sloshing around\
  \ with his siphon, on drainage bent, he forgot all about the shears, hence their\
  \ rustiness, their rustiness.\n\u201CYou must go and clip the hedge!\u201D commanded\
  \ the goblin perched on the peasant's shoulder, a few days after the downpour. The\
  \ sun was blazing, so hot the hedge was dry. Vapour rose from it and dispersed.\
  \ This was the morning I hid the cake in the box and the box behind the hedge. I\
  \ did not have a goblin on my shoulder. Hereabouts, it is only the peasants who\
  \ have goblins.\nThe peasant tramped about looking for his shears. He found them\
  \ leaning against the side of the barn, rusty, rusty. \u201CThese will never do\
  \ for clipping,\u201D he muttered, and spat, but his goblin goaded him on. It whispered\
  \ rustic lore into his ear.\n\u201CThe sun is boiling in the sky, clip your hedge\
  \ while it is dry. If your shears are caked in rust, fool you are but clip you must!\u201D\
  \nAfter hiding the box behind the hedge, I took up a position high on a slope, from\
  \ where I could keep the hedge in view, using binoculars. I was camouflaged as a\
  \ shrub. The more acute peasants know every inch of their land, and will be suspicious\
  \ of a sudden shrub, so I was wearing athlete's spikes in case I had to make a run\
  \ for it. But I drew the attention only of small snuffling mammals and one or two\
  \ birds of the air.\nI watched the peasant clipping the hedge with his rusty shears\
  \ all through the long afternoon. His goblin was fast asleep on his shoulder. The\
  \ sun was sinking. Inside the box sat my cake, packed, packed with sultanas, fruits\
  \ shrivelled by the same boiling sun, but on a different day, quite some time ago.\
  \ The hedge then had been less profuse, the shears not yet rusty, rusty, but the\
  \ goblin had even then been assigned to its peasant and taken up its perch on his\
  \ shoulder. Such are the country ways.\nIt was dusk when the clipping was done and\
  \ the peasant stubbed his toe upon the box. I was watching though my binoculars.\
  \ His goblin was awake again. It commanded him to open the box.\n\u201CIt has been\
  \ sealed shut with rivets,\u201D protested the peasant.\nCake and rivets, sultanas\
  \ and shears. What a world I engineer from my counterfeit shrub! I will outwit the\
  \ peasant's goblin, and it will seethe. Then I shall shrug off my shrub and hare\
  \ down the slope in moonlight, and go home, and put another cake in another box,\
  \ and seal the box with rivets, and hide it behind another hedge, tomorrow, tomorrow,\
  \ through my vinegar years.\n[2010-05-10]"
