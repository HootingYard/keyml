text: "Reports reach me of dismal doings at the Pointy Town Tourist Board. In an attempt\
  \ to drum up visitor numbers, a faction on the Board is engaged in not just the\
  \ rewriting of history, but its wholesale invention. The latest brochure invites\
  \ me, and thousands like me, to take part in the so-called Pointy Town Pilgrimage\
  \ Trail, experiencing \u201Cthe sights and sounds and tastes and smells that greeted\
  \ those ancient wayfarers who embarked upon the Pilgrimage to Pointy Town in days\
  \ of yore\u201D. This is shameless twaddle. In the ancient days to which the brochure\
  \ refers, Pointy Town itself did not exist. All a wayfarer of yore would have found\
  \ was an area of curiously pointy ground, with a few ponds on which ancient ducks\
  \ and swans clamoured. It is true that the pointiness of the land led later to the\
  \ erection of a town, but in ancient days there were not even any wattle-and-daub\
  \ dwellings there, and the area has no caves to speak of in which ancestral Pointy\
  \ Towners could have sheltered from the filthy weather.\nThe Tourist Board wants\
  \ us to believe, if I am interpreting the illustrations correctly, that thousands\
  \ of years ago saucy pilgrims with terrific hairstyles fetched up in Pointy Town\
  \ from all over the land, and even from lands beyond, and celebrated the general\
  \ pointiness of things by holding strange ancient ceremonies, traces of which can\
  \ be found today. For example, there is a gaping pit around the corner from the\
  \ present post office, and this is meant to be evidence not of botched contemporary\
  \ roadworks but of a rite involving herons and vipers and bees and hairy men. Where\
  \ all these herons and vipers and bees and hairy men are meant to have come from,\
  \ and how they gathered around the pit, and what they did once there gathered, is\
  \ all left a bit vague. As, to be frank, is the claim that the post office itself\
  \ stands on the site of the Pointy Town Thing, an ancient parliament on the Icelandic\
  \ model, and predating the Icelanders\u2019 own Thing by a good few centuries. I\
  \ am assured that next time I lick the reverse of a postage stamp at the post office\
  \ counter, I am doing so at the very spot where an ancient Pointy Towner named Anaxacaractagrax\
  \ proclaimed The Brimmings, whatever they are meant to be. This same Anaxacaractagrax\
  \ is supposedly related, how we are not told, to Atossa, the imperious mother of\
  \ Xerxes, which gets the Tourist Board into all sorts of chronological and geographical\
  \ knots.\nIndeed, there are so many knots, vagaries, and plain implausibilities\
  \ in this invented history that only a fool would be taken in. That being so, it\
  \ has to be said that there are plenty of foolish people around, for the Pointy\
  \ Town Pilgrimage Trail is proving to be a thunderous success. Last week I decided\
  \ to hie over there for the first time in years to see what was going on. I didn't\
  \ bother taking the brochure with me, for I had dropped it into a puddle and it\
  \ was not yet dry. I wore galoshes and the hat of a peasant for my trip, and rather\
  \ overdid breakfast in the dining carriage of the pneumatic railway train which\
  \ wheezed, with many spluttering halts, through the horrible countryside towards\
  \ Pointy Town, the pointy bits of which were visible long before we finally hissed\
  \ into the station. Having memorised the tourist brochure as best I could, I was\
  \ aware that the station was part of the pilgrimage trail. It was here, apparently,\
  \ that the counting of birds took place, the tally posted on a flag hoisted high.\
  \ What numeric system was used, what material the flag was woven from, and with\
  \ what instrument the flag was marked: none of this was made clear. Those ancient\
  \ folk may have had a sort of hemp, but we know for a fact that they had no ink.\
  \ And, in any case, how did they get all the birds to stand still and be counted?\
  \ I was already thoroughly exasperated as I made my way to the station canteen for\
  \ one last plate of sausages and treacle and a bowl of cornflakes and a beaker of\
  \ tea. Imagine my disgust when I saw that the beaker was stamped with a pilgrimage\
  \ emblem, and an accompanying leaflet informed me that it was a reproduction of\
  \ the beakers used by Pointy Town Pilgrims at celebratory feasts on the eve of the\
  \ Docking Hack.\nMy temper did not improve as I lumbered slowly into town. There\
  \ seemed to be not a single street, building, lamp-post or duckpond that had not\
  \ been hijacked by the Tourist Board for its counterfeit history. Even when I popped\
  \ into a snackbar for elevenses I could not escape. Sitting down to a hearty pan\
  \ of pig haunches and suet, I was joined immediately by a local person sporting\
  \ the hat of an indigent, who barely took time to introduce himself before regaling\
  \ me with his theory that the ancient Pointy Town pilgrims were not freeborn men\
  \ and women, but abductees, yoked together like farmyard creatures, driven to the\
  \ town by brutish captors for purposes we modern sophisticates could only guess\
  \ at. He had drawings, of course, which he took from an inner pocket of indescribable\
  \ grubbiness and spread out on the snackbar table, almost knocking over my tumbler\
  \ of fermenting berry slops as he did so. He talked me through each drawing with\
  \ some excitement, explaining that the sketches had come to him in fits of entranced\
  \ lucidity. I was not surprised to see spaceships patrolling the sky in about half\
  \ of these scribbles, but, curiously, he made no reference to them in his babble.\
  \ He was insistent that I go along with him to see one of the most pointy bits of\
  \ Pointy Town, where, he promised, he would show me incontrovertible evidence of\
  \ his abduction theory in the form of fragments of yoke and chain embedded in ancient\
  \ shards of bitumen. But I was having none of it. When I had finished my snack,\
  \ I knocked his hat off his head and swept his drawings off the table, stamping\
  \ them into the floor as I left.\nBack on the street, I checked my bearings by the\
  \ eerie late morning light and headed towards the town centre, where I wanted to\
  \ visit the Tourist Board Office. No one, it seemed, was willing to call into question\
  \ the falsification of Pointy Town history. Emboldened by my breakfasts and elevenses,\
  \ I determined to give the liars a piece of my mind. It was unlikely that, single-handed,\
  \ I could dismantle the rash of ahistorical poop engulfing what had been my favourite\
  \ town, but at least my spleen would be vented, as spleens require venting, preferably\
  \ after a good lunch. As I pranced alongside the graveyard wall, I reflected on\
  \ the disservice these bumptious numbskulls were doing to the true heroes of Pointy\
  \ Town past, men like Ferenc Puskas, the legendary Hungarian football ace, who though\
  \ he had no connection with the place whatsoever, and indeed had never even heard\
  \ of Pointy Town, let alone ever visited it in life, was nonetheless a numinous\
  \ presence in every park and garden and patch of mud, at least as far as I was concerned.\
  \ It mattered not to me that the Pointy Towners themselves were blind to his ethereal\
  \ dash and verve. Puskas, for me, was as much a presiding spirit of Pointy Town\
  \ as was the medieval chieftain Bruno La Poubelle, who laid out the winding pathways\
  \ of the old town, planted the grassy knoll, built the pergola and the schoolbook\
  \ depository, and made some of the pointy bits even pointier than nature intended.\
  \ But where was La Poubelle to be found in this new dispensation? It looked to me\
  \ as if the Tourist Board had erased him, and it was with a sick heart and a sick\
  \ brain that I crashed into the Caf\xE9 Spigot, next door to the Tourist Board Office,\
  \ to have my lunch.\nTucking into a gigantic helping of jugged hare, lobster and\
  \ branflakes, I rehearsed the uninvited lecture I planned to give to the wretched\
  \ begetters of the Pilgrimage Trail. I was assuming that they would all be there,\
  \ next door, skulking about, inventing fresh idiocies, counting the cash they had\
  \ fleeced from the ignorant. Only during the cheese, sponge and nuts course did\
  \ it occur to me that today was a public holiday, and the office was likely to be\
  \ shut. Yet by now I felt impelled to make the lying gits feel the lash of my tongue.\
  \ I would uphold the glory of the ghosts of Puskas and La Poubelle and dash their\
  \ pasteboard chaff aside, or squash it underfoot, or crumple it in the palm of my\
  \ hand, or whatever one does with chaff in Pointy Town. As I took dainty sips from\
  \ my post-prandial cuppasoup, I remembered that Pebblehead had written a bestselling\
  \ paperback called A Basic Survey Of Methods Of Pasteboard Chaff Disposal In Pointy\
  \ Town, and resolved to break and enter the library to consult a copy. Armed with\
  \ Pebblehead's techniques, perhaps I could destroy the heritage horrors disfiguring\
  \ the town and enwrap it once again in the protective blankets of La Poubelle and\
  \ Puskas.\nThe library was out beyond the seven tiny warehouses and the fairground,\
  \ which meant that I had to negotiate my way past the doll hospital, the most frightening\
  \ place in Pointy Town. Ever since I had first visited it, decades ago, as an ambitious\
  \ cub reporter sniffing out a story of gruesomeness, treachery, and doll-related\
  \ frightfulness, it had been the locus of my nightmares. I never did write up the\
  \ story, and resigned from the Pointy Town Herald & Thunderclap soon afterwards.\
  \ Thus began my long exile from the town of my birth, my estrangement from all I\
  \ held dear. The intervening decades have been hard on me, but as I swept along\
  \ Midge Ure Boulevard I realised that time has been harder on the town itself. All\
  \ I had cherished seemed to be either vanished or in decay, and even the pointy\
  \ bits on the approach to the warehouses seemed blunter and less pointy. Was the\
  \ Tourist Board solely responsible for the ruin, or were there other, wider, more\
  \ sinister forces at work? I pulled my windcheater tighter around my torso and popped\
  \ into a roadside tea room for a mug of tea and a jumbo packet of arrowroot biscuits.\n\
  The tea room, I learned, was annexed to the Pointy Town badger sanctuary, and imposed\
  \ a surcharge on each biscuit sold to fund its badger work. Admirable as this initiative\
  \ was, it made for a tremendously expensive snack, and I began to worry that I would\
  \ not have cash enough in my pippy bag to afford supper before catching the train\
  \ home. I also needed to drop into an ironmongery to buy, or rent, the tools necessary\
  \ to effect my breaking into the library. I was counting out my remaining coins\
  \ on the tea room's formica tabletop when a moustachioed old timer sidled over to\
  \ me. He wore the hat of an ingrate, and gave off a distinct aura of bitter gall.\
  \ I was in no mood for another snackbar conversation with a conspiracy theorist,\
  \ so without a word I turfed the oldster's hat from his head, scooped my coinage\
  \ back into my pippy bag, and made for the door.\nI was halfway towards the ironmongery\
  \ merchant when I realised that the elderly ingrate, now hatless, was following\
  \ me, but making no attempt to catch up. I stopped, and he stopped too. I took one\
  \ pace forward, and he took two. This was because I have a long, loping stride,\
  \ whereas my pursuer took more cautious, rickety steps. I was surprised he did not\
  \ topple over. Using binoculars, I scanned his face, to which I had paid little\
  \ attention in the tea room. So bushy and magnificent was his moustache that it\
  \ was difficult to see beyond it, but it struck me that there was something familiar\
  \ about him. He tugged at a corner of my memory, but I could not yet place him.\
  \ Tucking the binoculars back into their pouch, I walked on, occasionally checking\
  \ to see if he still trailed me, and he did.\nThe afternoon sun blazed high in the\
  \ sky as I reached the spot near the municipal flowerbeds where I expected to find\
  \ the ironmongery. Many, many years had passed since last I was in Pointy Town,\
  \ but I hardly expected to find this landmark emporium gone. It was, after all,\
  \ the most inspiring ironmongery in the whole province, a magnet for bolt-cutting\
  \ enthusiasts near and far. Yet no trace of it survived. In its place stood a plinth\
  \ atop which was a hideous cement statue of a saucy pilgrim with a terrific hairstyle,\
  \ holding a cement placard announcing that this was the end of the Pointy Town Pilgrim\
  \ Trail. It was ugly, it was spurious, and a magnificent ironmongery shop had been\
  \ bulldozed by the philistines on the Tourist Board to make way for it. I was livid.\
  \ I was also dashed in my plan to buy, or rent, tools with which to jemmy the lock\
  \ on the library door. What now?\nI leaned against the railings surrounding the\
  \ plinth and took from my pocket a bag of brisket and toffee. Munching on these\
  \ would steady my nerves, and allow me time to think. Just as I bit off a mouthful\
  \ of brisket, I was overcome by an aura of bitter gall, and the ingrate who had\
  \ been tailing me suddenly materialised at my side, in a manner I was unable to\
  \ comprehend and cannot describe. He simply stood there, lugubrious and mournful,\
  \ with flies circling his hatless head. He was close enough that I had no need of\
  \ binoculars to examine his face, and I forced my eyes to peer behind the moustache,\
  \ trying to recall where I had seen him before.\nI grew up in Pointy Town, and had\
  \ an idyllic childhood. I remember tents and swans and dramatic hiking incidents.\
  \ I remember flag days and sing-songs and buying my first, child-sized, bolt-cutters\
  \ and other ironmongery items. I remember toads and pastries and gutta percha. I\
  \ remember hearing the name Ferenc Puskas on the radio, and the sound of thousands\
  \ cheering. And I remember lolloping home from the library clutching my favourite\
  \ book, A Lavishly Illustrated History Of Pointy Town For Pointy Town Tinies. And\
  \ I remember the frontispiece of the book, a mezzotint by the mezzotintist Rex Tint\
  \ of the medieval Pointy Town chieftain Bruno La Poubelle, with his fantastically\
  \ bushy moustache. He it was\u2014or his wraith\u2014who stood beside me now. No\
  \ wonder he was engulfed in an aura of bitter gall, witnessing the desecration of\
  \ the town he raised from a patch of pointy ground. I gaped at him, pop-eyed, nearly\
  \ choking on my brisket. Then the sky, so sunny a moment ago, was plunged into an\
  \ uncanny blackness, and I felt La Poubelle's hands upon my shoulders, shrivelled\
  \ yet firm, and I felt the rustle of his mighty moustache upon my forehead, and\
  \ then I, too, was enveloped in his aura of bitter gall. But I felt most intensely\
  \ an ennoblement of my spirit, and a startled recognition that with the potency\
  \ of my brain alone I could smash to smithereens every vile Tourist Board Pilgrimage\
  \ Trail bubo throbbing with venom in the Pointy Town I loved. I could obliterate\
  \ them in an instant, if I wished. The blackness evaporated, the sun blazed again\
  \ as it always did on this blessed town, and I dipped my hand into my bag of brisket\
  \ and toffee, ready to offer a bite to Bruno La Poubelle. But the apparition had\
  \ vanished. I was alone by the railings, beneath the cement statue of the spurious\
  \ saucy pilgrim with the terrific hairstyle. I had the power to dash it to dust.\
  \ How would I choose?\nI retraced my steps to the town centre, beaming as I passed\
  \ the ducks and swans clamouring on the pond and tipping my peasant's hat to the\
  \ demonstrators from Gorgeous George Galloway's Respect Party who were marching\
  \ against something or other, or in favour of something else. A beetle-browed university\
  \ lecturer dodged out of the demo and pressed a shoddy newspaper upon me, so I tested\
  \ out my new powers by swatting him aside merely by raising an eyebrow. I was pleased\
  \ to note that as he hurtled over the horizon at inhuman speed, his pile of newspapers\
  \ burst into flames. I went back to the Caf\xE9 Spigot and ordered a dish of bloaters\
  \ and spam and goose grease and fudge sundae, and as I sat waiting, I decided that\
  \ I would let the evening train leave without me. I had come back to Pointy Town,\
  \ and now I had work to do.\n[2007-10-21]"
