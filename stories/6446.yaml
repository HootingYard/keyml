text: "\nNow you too can speak and write like Percy Grainger! At Strange Flowers,\
  \ which I am extremely pleased to have discovered, James Conway provides a splendid\
  \ list of Grainger-approved words. He explains:\n\u2026 the older he got the more\
  \ cantankerous he became. A 1958 piece entitled \u201CThe Things I Dislike\u201D\
  \ began \u201CAlmost everything. First of all foreigners, which means: all Europeans\
  \ except the British, the Scandinavians & the Dutch.\u201D\nGrainger was nothing\
  \ if not thorough, and his distrust of anything originating south of Holland led\
  \ to him to try and purge his writing of Greco-Latin elements\nThere is much more\
  \ in the piece about the madcap Antipodean composer, but the highlight is the glossary\
  \ itself. Go thou hence and memorise it, and soon you will be able to write vast\
  \ epic poems akin to those of Charles Montague Doughty, surely Grainger's guiding\
  \ spirit?\n[2011-04-19]"
