text: "It is sometimes appropriate to signal a want of sausages in semaphore. For\
  \ example, you might find yourself sausageless in the middle of a desolate plain,\
  \ some sort of Biblical wilderness, ravenous for sausages but, happily, in possession\
  \ of two brightly-coloured flags. If you have a smattering of semaphore, and a broad\
  \ knowledge of sausage types, it should not be beyond your wit to signal your want\
  \ of sausages, using the flags, to a distant passer-by. Whether this passer-by will\
  \ be able to satisfy your sausagelust is, of course, quite another matter.\nWe should\
  \ also take into account the very distinct possibility that such a signalling is\
  \ beyond your wit\u2014in short, that you are witless, or, if not entirely witless,\
  \ then a halfwit. Standing about in the middle of a plain with a couple of flags\
  \ yet bereft of sausages is the sort of behaviour we might expect from a halfwit.\n\
  Halfwits and dunderpates are not the best people when it comes to accurate and reliable\
  \ semaphore signals. Indeed, they can become so muddle-headed in their attempts\
  \ to deploy a pair of flags according to a well-established code that their message\
  \ is likely to be gibberish. This will leave the distant passer-by scratching their\
  \ head in confusion and deciding to continue on their stroll, along the edge of\
  \ the plain, perhaps Luneburg Heath, with their dog in tow.\nMost dogs can sniff\
  \ out sausages with bewildering acuity. There are even some dogs known as \u201C\
  sausage dogs\u201D. It can all become very complicated, especially if you are a\
  \ halfwit.\n[2016-09-16]"
