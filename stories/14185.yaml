text: "\u201CYou seem preoccupied, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew to the out of\
  \ print pamphleteer one morning over breakfast. It was a thunderous day of thunder\
  \ and thunderclaps and the couple were tucking into boiled suet \u2018n\u2019 marzipan\
  \ \xE0\_la Metternich, a dish extolled in a footnote in Dobson's pamphlet Breakfast\
  \ Favourites Of The Austrian Empire Foreign Ministry 1809\u20131821 (out of print).\n\
  Dobson did not reply, for he was preoccupied.\nThe following morning, over breakfast,\
  \ Marigold Chew became so perturbed at Dobson's seeming residence in la-la land\
  \ that she resorted to the Dusty Springfield method to snap him out of it. Named\
  \ after the 1960s popstrel's hobby, this involved the systematic smashing of crockery\
  \ by throwing plates and dishes one by one with great, indeed hysterical, force\
  \ against the wall. Several smithereens lay scattered on the floor before Dobson\
  \ was of a sudden unpreoccupied.\n\u201CAh, good morning, my buttercup of unparalleled\
  \ gorgeousness,\u201D said Dobson, through a mouthful of steamed shredded hyacinth\
  \ stalks in syrup.\n\u201CYou have been terribly preoccupied, Dobson,\u201D said\
  \ Marigold Chew, \u201CWhatever is going on in that brain of yours?\u201D\n\u201C\
  I am inwardly tussling,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CWith my latest pamphlet, to which\
  \ I have given the working title Andy Martin, The Tyrannical Leader Of UNIT, And\
  \ Why He Is The Most Fantastic Person In The Visible Universe\u201D.\n\u201CI have\
  \ no doubt your inner tussle will prove as productive as ever,\u201D said Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CBut may I make one small point, a point which I suggest is germane\
  \ to your tussle and preoccupation?\u201D\n\u201CAnd what would that be, oh daffodil\
  \ of my dreams?\u201D said Dobson.\n\u201CWell, as you and I and your optometrist\
  \ know only too well, Dobson, you are severely myopic. Thus, for you, the visible\
  \ universe does not stretch very far. Indeed, it stops just a few inches away from\
  \ the front of your head. I do not see Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of UNIT, in\
  \ the vicinity, and I feel sure I would spot him were he within a few inches of,\
  \ or indeed sitting at, my breakfast table.\u201D\n\u201CI am going to go and chuck\
  \ pebbles at swans,\u201D said Dobson, getting up from his chair and putting on\
  \ his Swabian Bus Ticket Collector's boots and crashing out of the door into the\
  \ downpour which, as on the day before, was accompanied by thunderous thunder and\
  \ thunderclaps. Marigold Chew had raised a sticky problem about his pamphlet, one\
  \ he did not wish to discuss, indeed could not discuss. Hence his sudden departure,\
  \ leaving his breakfast unfinished.\nUnfortunately, so sudden was his departure\
  \ that Dobson neglected to put on his specs. Unable to see more than a few inches\
  \ ahead, he blundered towards where he thought the duckpond was, only to take a\
  \ wrong turn and find himself hopelessly lost in a patch of bracken and rustic filth.\
  \ He found himself, too, once more preoccupied, but this time on a wholly different\
  \ subject. Why, he wondered, was the duckpond, populated as it was mostly by swans,\
  \ called the duckpond rather than the swanpond? It was true that ducks were occasionally\
  \ to be found dabbling upon it, but any such ducks tended to scarper pretty quickly\
  \ when ganged up on by the savage and violent, yet indubitably elegant, swans.\n\
  \u201CI wonder,\u201D said Dobson to himself, aloud, in the mist of his own myopia,\
  \ \u201CWhether I ought to abandon the Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of UNIT, business\
  \ for the time being and instead turn my propelling pencil to the question of duckpond\
  \ nomenclature?\u201D\nAnd there was then a terrifically thunderous and thundery\
  \ thunderclap, which Dobson chose to interpret as the Gods replying to his question\
  \ in the affirmative. Turning in the direction he thought would take him home, he\
  \ wrapped his Stalinist scarf tighter round his neck and squelched through the muck.\
  \ But alas!, the pamphleteer's sense of direction was as pitiful as his eyesight,\
  \ and several weeks passed before he found his way home, by which time he had completely\
  \ forgotten about duckponds and swanponds.\n\u201CWhat is the subject of the pamphlet\
  \ you are working on?\u201D asked Marigold Chew over breakfast on the morning after\
  \ Dobson's return.\n\u201CIt is called Fortune-Telling By Interpreting The Patterns\
  \ Created By Crockery Smithereens Smashed According To The Dusty Springfield Method,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson, \u201CAnd I expect to be able to dot the final i and cross the final\
  \ t this very afternoon.\u201D\nAnd he did, though the pamphlet itself is currently\
  \ out of print.\n[2015-11-03]"
