  Over in my cupboard at The Dabbler today I try, as best I can, to come to terms
  with the most seismic event in our national life for centuries. I am not ashamed
  to admit that I wept, wept I tell you!, and copious were my tears, and salty were
  they too, at the self-willed downfall of perhaps the one true political colossus
  of the past five hundred years.

  my hand at devising a convincing Robert Ludlum-style title, in preparation for a
  forthcoming cinema franchise. But who would star as David Miliband?
