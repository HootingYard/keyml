text: "\nThe picture above adorns the cover of the latest bestselling paperback by\
  \ Pebblehead. Entitled Cupboard!, it is a fast-paced and thrill-packed adventure\
  \ featuring Pebblehead's recurring hero Dax Manley Hopkins, manly, winsome, beguiled\
  \ and unflappable. Though the cupboard of the title is singular, there are hundreds,\
  \ possibly thousands of cupboards in the book, some of which Dax opens to take a\
  \ look inside at crucial moments in the plot. One such is the cupboard the contents\
  \ of which are shown, neatly arranged, in the picture. It is called the \u201CL\
  \ Ron\u201D Cupboard, for reasons which Pebblehead never quite makes explicit, unless\
  \ I am misreading him. God knows it is easy enough to misread Pebblehead. For all\
  \ the dash and verve of his effortless prose, the effect is sometimes as if one\
  \ is reading an inept translation from a language if not quite dead, then at least\
  \ sick and sprawled ungainly upon an invalid's mattress.\nThe objects in the cupboard\
  \ are, we are told, made of dough and painted with a coating of emulsion. Each has\
  \ a function which is utterly baffling, at least to Dax, though he has managed to\
  \ lay his hands on a set of laminated flash cards giving the name of each item.\
  \ These names are enigmatic. Here they are:\nTop shelf, left to right\_: 1. Bombs\
  \ a\u2019 Poe. 2. Luxembourg bales. 3. The Kreutzer Sonata. 4. Yoko Eno Bono.\n\
  Second shelf, left to right\_: 5. Eaten in Harbin. 6. La Condoleezza. 7. Gas giant.\n\
  Third shelf, left to right\_: 8. National Cylinder. 9. Weems. 10. Agony in the garden.\
  \ 11. Gold Diggers of 1933.\nFourth shelf, left to right\_: 12. Alone and palely\
  \ loitering. 13. Thou art Pierre Loti, innit.\nBottom shelf, left to right\_: 14.\
  \ Bittern storm over Ulm 15. Yeast fixture.\nI will not spoil the bestselling paperback\
  \ for you by telling you what happens when Dax, so manly and winsome and beguiled\
  \ and unflappable, first opens, then closes the cupboard. (The scene takes place\
  \ on pp. 409\u2013444.)\nOr, the picture might be by Robinet Testard, an image from\
  \ Matthaeus Platearius's The Book of Simple Medicine, Ms. Fr. VI n. 1, fol. 166v.,\
  \ c. 1470, St. Petersburg National Library, which I found at Mapping The Marvellous.\n\
