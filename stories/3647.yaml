text: "The most popular search terms that bring unwitting Interwebshire hikers to\
  \ the gates of Hooting Yard remain bees, Googie Withers, and lobster diagram, but\
  \ I was pleased to note a new entrant yesterday. Two people arrived here after typing\
  \ in moorhen appreciation society. Well, we know all about moorhens here, and we\
  \ appreciate them too, so I trust the visiting hikers went away suitably gleeful.\
  \ Meanwhile, pursuing my own researches, I discovered the existence of the Moorhen\
  \ Appreciation Society on Facebook Facecloth. I was charmed, to say the least, by\
  \ its single item of \u201Cnews\u201D, which is \u201CI saw a moorhen this morning\u201D\
  . I cannot say the same for myself, alas, though I did spot a few squirrels, one\
  \ of which was carrying, in its squirrel-jaws, the shredded remains of a Mars Bar\
  \ wrapper.\nI am fairly sure that Dobson was at one time a member of his local Moorhen\
  \ Appreciation Society. The out of print pamphleteer joined it for reasons we can\
  \ only guess at, for as we know the space in the human brain devoted to ornithological\
  \ matters was in Dobson's case either utterly vacant or so clogged up the synapses\
  \ misfired. He was forced to resign his membership when it became clear that he\
  \ could not tell the difference between a moorhen and a heron, and embroiled the\
  \ Society in legal entanglements in the bird courts. His pamphlet Well, They Both\
  \ Have Beaks And Feathers, For Christ's Sake! (out of print) recounts the whole\
  \ sorry saga, though it is quite an exasperating read for those of us who are more\
  \ engaged with the avian world than Dobson was.\n[2010-01-09]"
