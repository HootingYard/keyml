text: "I like words. I like fat buttery words, such as ooze, turpitude, glutinous,\
  \ toady. I like solemn, angular, creaky words, such as straitlaced, cantankerous,\
  \ pecunious, valedictory. I like spurious, black-is-white words, such as mortician,\
  \ liquidate, tonsorial, demi-monde. I like suave \u201CV\u201D words, such as Svengali,\
  \ svelte, bravura, verve. I like crunchy, brittle, crackly words, such as splinter,\
  \ grapple, jostle, crusty. I like sullen, crabbed, scowling words, such as skulk,\
  \ glower, scabby, churl. I like Oh-Heavens, my-gracious, land's-sake words, such\
  \ as tricksy, tucker, genteel, horrid. I like elegant, flowery words, such as estivate,\
  \ peregrinate, elysium, halcyon. I like wormy, squirmy, mealy words, such as crawl,\
  \ blubber, squeal, drip. I like sniggly, chuckling words, such as cowlick, gurgle,\
  \ bubble and burp.\nRobert Pirosh, in a 1934 letter reproduced at Letters Of Note\n\
