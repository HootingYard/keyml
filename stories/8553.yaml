text: 'An amusing letter in today''s Grauniad:

  Having written a piece of music based on the sinking of the Titanic, I might perhaps
  be lumped with the Titanoraks (Pass notes, G2, 5 March). Inevitably this 1969 piece
  is being performed several times this year. Recently a young Belgian composer contacted
  me to ask if his composition on the subject might be performed alongside mine in
  his country. His piece is written from the point of view of the iceberg.
