text: "O baleful pig! With your look of reproach, you fill me with feelings of guilt.\
  \ And so I've embroidered the image of you upon my tattered quilt. Yes, it is tattered,\
  \ yes, it is torn, and my sewing is shoddy and frayed. You look more like a moorhen\
  \ or even a goat-boy disporting himself in a glade. I spread out the quilt for my\
  \ kinsfolk to see and they mocked my hamfisted cross-stitch. Aunt Mab bundled it\
  \ up and carried it off and tossed it into a ditch. So your imperfect image lies\
  \ soaked in a puddle, O baleful, baleful pig! And I blame myself and my cackhanded\
  \ ways and I sob as I light up a cig. And I puff on my cig at the edge of the ditch\
  \ and remember your low mordant grunting when you stood on your plinth at the champion\
  \ pig fair \u2018neath a string of shabby old bunting. I sewed that too, and it\
  \ showed, it was tatty and filthy and stained and made out of rags, when I was a\
  \ convict and should have been using my needle in sewing up mail bags. They let\
  \ me out in time to see you win the prize you hated winning. And now within my head\
  \ I hear relentless dinning, dinning, the dinning of the rain pour down on my pig\
  \ picture sewn from thread, oh badly sewn, I know, with cotton cerulean blue and\
  \ red. A blue-red pig? Or is it a goat-boy? Or a moorside bird? They mock. Your\
  \ heart was weak. When they made you champ, it cracked. You died of shock/ O baleful\
  \ pig, R.I.P. I buried you under the Joshua tree.\n[2010-12-03]"
