text: "Here is an old favourite, written over thirty years ago. Two words have been\
  \ changed from the original version. I have no idea what it means, but it might\
  \ be diverting to subject it to piercing critical analysis. Does anybody want to\
  \ have a go?\nHats are off in Docking; caps are being doffed. The council's got\
  \ a town plan. The maths are on a chart. Pips have been spat out and drudgery is\
  \ bye-byed. Chocolate puddings seem to be in everybody's pantry. And here comes\
  \ Pebblehead p\xE8re. He caught a shark in waters. His sou'wester's been askew since\
  \ 1954-ish. Bubbles surge from froth. The chemist's shop is shut. There's pills\
  \ & pills & pills that no Docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted. The council\
  \ in a caucus. The shaven heads of heads of state are battering the doors down.\
  \ The city gates, the turrets, the alleys, roads & mews: Docking has its ears all\
  \ go for red alert decisions. Language has been no-no'd, the bamboo men are wailing,\
  \ the breakage rate is scheduled: the system has been broken. Crayons pink & stacked,\
  \ the burnt sienna packaged. Vandals clash at nightfall, but Docking has its crackers.\
  \ Plastic wrapped in plastic. The Docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar,\
  \ a gorgeous snag-tooth babble. Prepared to dance a hoo-cha, not a tear or boo-hoo.\
  \ Thousands of museums stacked with golden maps. Misshapen trunk road closures.\
  \ Big stone reconstructions. Docking's cottoned on: it's a town about a tower. The\
  \ frame is out of kilter, the coughing's filling coffins. Oh, but I want to go back\
  \ to that Docking, Docking hack.\n[2018-02-07]"
