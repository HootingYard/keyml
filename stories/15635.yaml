  Poor scribblers whose efforts are repeatedly rejected find solace from cases such
  as William Golding, who sent the manuscript of his first novel to more than twenty
  publishers before it was eventually accepted. Although stubborn persistence can
  sometimes pay off, the example of Golding demonstrates that, when a sympathetic
  editor offers advice, it can be wise to take it. Thus it is useful to learn that
  the beardy author made several changes to his book, which started out as the tale
  of a group of schoolboys trying desperately to remove a blockage of pig fat from
  a heating duct. He also changed the original title, Lard Of The Flues.
