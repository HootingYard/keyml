  \ representative sample of contemporary items\u2019, were deposited in the pedestal\
  \ [of Cleopatra's Needle, on Thames Embankment]. \u2018The mere list of these objects,\u2019\
  \ declared the Saturday Review, \u2018must provoke a smile.\u2019 It was certainly\
  \ well-calculated to have this effect, for, among them, were a Bible, a translation\
  \ of the hieroglyphics on the column, a portrait of the Queen, a standard set of\
  \ weights and measures, a Whitaker's Almanack, a Bradshaw's railway-guide, a Post\
  \ Office directory, a \u2018Mappin's shilling razor\u2019, an \u2018Alexandra feeding-bottle,\
  \ as used in the Royal nurseries\u2019, and \u2018photographs of twelve pretty Englishwomen\u2019\
  . Altogether, a mixed assortment.\u201D\nHorace Wyndham, This Was The News\_: An\
