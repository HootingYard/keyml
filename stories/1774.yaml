text: "Maud Glubb, the aviatrix and author of The Book Of Gnats, is just one among\
  \ a number of Glubbs of note. This ought not surprise us. After all, as H P Lovecraft\
  \ wrote in The Thing On The Doorstep, It began with a telephone call just before\
  \ midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the library.\
  \ No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when\
  \ my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying\
  \ under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid\
  \ bubbling noise\u2014\u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub\u201D\u2014which had an odd\
  \ suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called\
  \ \u201CWho is it?\u201D But the only answer was \u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub-glub.\u201D\
  \ (The one-B Glub is a common American variant of the more standard two-B Glubb.)\
  \ It can be argued that Lovecraft's \u201Cglub\u201D is a repetition of a single\
  \ Glubb, much as we accept that Edgar Allan Poe was referring to only one person\
  \ when he shouted the name \u201CReynolds!\u201D repeatedly as he lay dying in the\
  \ Washington College Hospital in Baltimore. Yet Lovecraft clearly indicates \u201C\
  unintelligible word and syllable divisions\u201D, which sensible people who have\
  \ their wits about them will take as hard evidence of multiple Glubbs.\nOne such\
  \ other Glubb, if we use that term to distinguish our subjects from the aviatrix,\
  \ was Old Mother Glubb. This fine upstanding dowager was not the mother of Maud\
  \ Glubb, by the way. In fact as far as we can ascertain, Old Mother Glubb had no\
  \ children. She was dubbed \u201COld Mother\u201D because she was very aged, at\
  \ the time we learn of her existence, and because she bred moths. It is easy to\
  \ see how people assumed that \u201CMother\u201D, to rhyme with \u201CHiawatha\u201D\
  , should be pronounced to rhyme instead with \u201Cbrother\u201D. From such tiny\
  \ presumptions can titanic historical errors occur. Several bright and promising\
  \ genealogists saw their careers ruined, their health destroyed, and their lives\
  \ wasted as they tried and failed to track down Old Mother Glubb's non-existent\
  \ progeny. Had they known about her revolutionary moth-breeding programme, and the\
  \ attention it gained from moth experts on two or three continents, things may have\
  \ been very different indeed. Or perhaps not. Perhaps each of these genealogists\
  \ had a fatal flaw which sent them chasing phantoms, and had they not driven themselves\
  \ mad with Old Mother Glubb, they would have alighted upon some other hopeless pursuit.\
  \ There are many, in the groves of academe.\nThere is, for example, the case of\
  \ another Glubb, Binnie Glubb, the man who became Professor of Futile Studies at\
  \ a large important university. Sometimes called the senile grandparent of postmodernism,\
  \ Binnie Glubb spent years and years writing incomprehensible twaddle, in unreadable\
  \ prose, about\u2026 well, about god knows what. If we knew what he was writing\
  \ about it would suggest that occasionally he was both comprehensible and readable,\
  \ and he was neither, ever. And yet his screeds were typeset and bound and published\
  \ and sold and stuck upon shelves in libraries across the land, and he had his photograph\
  \ taken, smoking a pipe, shoulder to shoulder with a French intellectual or a Maoist\
  \ psychopath, and airheads wrote fawning profiles of him for the Sunday supplements.\n\
  No such plaudits for the next Glubb in our set, the one-legged bobsleigh competitor\
  \ Digby Glubb. He was a sports-mad youth who was nonetheless completely useless\
  \ at everything he tried. Failing at p\xE9tanque, he took up pingpong. Failing at\
  \ pingpong, he tried vinkensport. Savaged by finches, he turned to curling, and\
  \ failed again, failed better, as Beckett might say. All this time he had two legs.\
  \ On his thirtieth birthday, still utterly useless in all sporting events, he toppled\
  \ into a ditch full of fierce biting ants, which ate most of one of his legs before\
  \ he was rescued by an ant-killing patrol. Recovering in a superbly sterile clinic,\
  \ Digby Glubb researched sports he could take part in while sitting down, and decided\
  \ to devote his life to bobsleigh, in spite of the fact that he did not quite understand\
  \ the point of it. For two decades he continually crashed any bobsleigh he sat in,\
  \ whether solo or as part of a team. What drove him on, from one calamity to another?\
  \ Was it perhaps revenge against the fierce biting ants which had hobbled him? There\
  \ are those who can be spurred on by often harmful derangements, be they vengeance\
  \ or jealousy or preening vanity.\nConsider the cravattiste Shelvington Glubb. Convinced\
  \ that, when he wore one of his cravats, he might be mistaken for a young Apollo,\
  \ this Glubb pranced about the boulevards of Pointy Town watching Pointy Towners\
  \ gasp and swoon at his beauty. Some of them were blinded, he was so like the sun.\n\
  There, you have some Glubbs to be going on with.\n[2009-02-13]"
