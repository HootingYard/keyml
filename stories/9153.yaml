text: "Few problems in the history of human activity on earth have proved as intractable\
  \ as the placement of the apostrophe in the title of the Reader's Digest magazine.\
  \ Indeed, running it close as a question which befuddles the heads of the best and\
  \ brightest is whether the title includes the definite article or not. As if to\
  \ demonstrate that I know precisely what I am talking about, we have seen two variants,\
  \ Reader's Digest and The Readers\u2019 Digest, right here at Hooting Yard in the\
  \ past few days.\nHooting Yard itself does not contain an apostrophe, thank heavens,\
  \ but occasionally it has been referred to as The Hooting Yard. I have no idea where\
  \ on earth those who deploy this usage get that The from. Mr Key has certainly never\
  \ used it himself. Let us be clear. There is not now, nor has there ever been, nor\
  \ will there ever be, in any conceivable future, a prefixed definite article in\
  \ Hooting Yard. If any doubt remains, the best idea would be for those who cannot\
  \ grasp this simple fact to have the previous sentence tattooed, in mirror writing,\
  \ upon their foreheads.\nIf only things were so plain and straightforward in Reader's\
  \ Digest land. But they are not. Let us get that definite article out of the way\
  \ to begin with, before we concentrate our pulsating brains upon the knotty problem\
  \ of the apostrophe. The issue is clouded by the fact that Reader's Digest (without\
  \ the The) is published by The Reader's Digest Association (with the The). Easy\
  \ enough, then, for a person who is not necessarily a dimwit or a clodpoll to carry\
  \ over the definite article from the name of the publisher to the publication it\
  \ publishes. There is a certain logic to doing so. But therein lie the perils of\
  \ granting too high a status to logic. Yes, human beings have developed the powers\
  \ of logic over millennia, and they have proved a boon in many fields of endeavour,\
  \ from agriculture to zoology. But logic only gets us so far, and ought not be applied\
  \ in those areas where it is a drawback. I am thinking of such areas as politics\
  \ and magazine nomenclature. In politics, logic, or at least the illusion of logic,\
  \ leads to the utopian barbarities of Lenin or Pol Pot. In magazine nomenclature,\
  \ it leads to calling Reader's Digest The Reader's Digest. Granted, in the latter\
  \ case the human consequences are negligible, even nonexistent, but we must always\
  \ beware of slippery slopes. That is the lesson an elderly relative taught me after\
  \ an Alpine to-do. Recounting the details of the to-do might provide this piece\
  \ with some much needed colour and vim and grit, but lord love a duck!, another\
  \ time\u2026 another time\u2026\nLesson One, then. The title of the magazine is\
  \ Reader's Digest, without a The.\nHaving honed our wits on that one, we can turn\
  \ to the infinitely more pernickety problem of the apostrophe. Curiously enough,\
  \ logic, or the absence of logic, will be of no help to us here. One of the reasons\
  \ the placement of the apostrophe in the title has proved so maddening for so many\
  \ for so many decades is that an argument can be made, and a compelling argument\
  \ to boot, for both Reader's and Readers\u2019. Neither is, in and of itself, in\
  \ context, right or wrong. Let us recall what was in the minds of the founders,\
  \ De Witt Wallace (1889\u20131981), and his ever-loving wife Lila Bell Wallace n\xE9\
  e Acheson (1889\u20131984). Their bright idea was to gather a sample of articles\
  \ on many subjects from various monthly magazines and journals, sometimes condensing\
  \ and rewriting them, and to combine them into a single publication\u2014a digest.\
  \ A bit like Hooting Yard, in other words. Well, not really. Not at all in fact.\
  \ I don't know why I wrote that, unless perhaps I was brain-bedizened at the thought\
  \ of the millions of readers the Wallaces attracted, almost from the start in 1922.\
  \ Let me take a deep breath and becalm my pounding brainpans and continue.\nHaving\
  \ concocted the idea of a Digest for Magazine Readers, it must have been a simple\
  \ enough matter for De Witt and Lila Bell to plump for Reader's Digest\u2014or Readers\u2019\
  \ Digest\u2014as the name of their publication. A few months ago, in discussing\
  \ Skippy The Bush Kangaroo, I imagined its creator John McCallum sitting at the\
  \ breakfast table with his wife Googie Withers, as he struggled to come up with\
  \ the name of the bush kangaroo heroine of his television series. We might similarly\
  \ imagine the Wallaces at breakfast, not of course in Sydney, Australia, but in\
  \ their modest yet beautifully-appointed home in Minneapolis St Paul. De Witt, you\
  \ may recall, was recovering from shrapnel wounds received in Flanders fields during\
  \ the Great War, so in this scene we might picture him still enbandaged, whey-faced\
  \ and peaky.\nLila Bell\_: Given your shrapnel wounds, sweet darling, are you sure\
  \ you are able to spread that Lurpak on your toast, or would you like me to help?\n\
  De Witt\_: I think I can manage, oh poppet. I am just thinking how lucky we are\
  \ to have this Danish proprietary brand of butter available, here in Minnesota in\
  \ the early nineteen-twenties.\nLila Bell\_: It is undoubtedly one of the benefits\
  \ of the capitalist system, light of my life. But let us try to reach a final decision\
  \ on the placement of the apostrophe in the title of the magazine we hope to publish\
  \ soon.\nDe Witt\_: [Unintelligible response due to mouth crammed with toast \u2018\
  n\u2019 Lurpak.]\nLila Bell\_: I did not quite catch that, honeybun. Remember, it\
  \ pays to refine your table manners.\nDe Witt\_: [Swallowing, and wiping his mouth\
  \ with a napkin.] I apologise, dear heart. That was most remiss of me. Let me repeat\
  \ what I said, this time with a mouth free of toast \u2018n\u2019 Lurpak. I think\
  \ the best place for the apostrophe is\u2014\u2013 \u2013\nDe Witt Wallace is interrupted\
  \ by a sudden and insistent hammering at the door. Lila Bell goes to answer it,\
  \ to find a person from Porlock on the doorstep.\nHaving researched the matter thoroughly,\
  \ I am able to reconstruct what De Witt Wallace was about to say, to wit:\nDe Witt\_\
  :\u2014\u2013\u2014 between the R and the S rather than after the S.\nAnd I like\
  \ to think that, given the chance, he would have continued as follows:\nDe Witt\_\
  : The apostrophe placed after the S suggests our magazine is a digest for readers,\
  \ plural. Which, of course, is what we desire, if we are not to be cast into penury,\
  \ fire of my loins. We will scarcely be able to build a global publishing empire\
  \ without a multitude of readers, whose digest we will provide.\nLila Bell\_: Then\
  \ I fail to see the logic of your pronouncement, popsy.\nDe Witt\_: Ah, pumpkin,\
  \ but by placing the apostrophe to suggest it is a digest for just one reader, we\
  \ cleverly instil in each and every reader's mind that the magazine is for them,\
  \ and them alone. Even though it isn't. We are saying, \u201CYou are the reader,\
  \ and this digest is just for you\u201D.\nLila Bell\_: Gosh!\nThus, Lesson Two\_\
  : The apostrophe in Reader's Digest appears between the R and the S, not after the\
  \ S.\n[2012-05-13]"
