text: "Here is a snippet from Phil Baker's excellent The Devil Is A Gentleman\_: The\
  \ Life And Times Of Dennis Wheatley (2009):\nStar Of Ill Omen is an extraordinary\
  \ performance, with its characteristically fraught and tender Wheatley love story\
  \ (quite unlike James Bond and his girls) embedded in a mind-bogglingly improbable\
  \ Cold War potboiler. Realistic details are combined with a larger naivety about\
  \ space that wouldn't be out of place in Dan Dare, and there are moments whose sheer\
  \ weirdness compares with the work of proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel: when, for\
  \ example, the insects [a breed of hyper-intelligent insects who buzz around like\
  \ bees and give telepathic orders] show them black and white films of great moments\
  \ in human history, and\n\u201Cthe bee-beetles who controlled the machine again\
  \ pressed the lever; again the machine whirred and the words came, \u2018Music while\
  \ you work\u2019, followed by the rumba.\u201D\nWheatley never attempted science\
  \ fiction again.\n[2011-12-14]"
