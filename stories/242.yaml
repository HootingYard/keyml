  this week is the Goon Fang Pinocchio Of Camshafts, and next week is the Complacent
  Herons Of Totteridge & Whetstone.

  Please ensure your beads and counters are correctly aligned, and that your cushions
  are appropriately embroidered. If you will be eating any figs next week, be sure
  to keep them in a covered bowl and tilt the bowl slightly on your shelf. You can
  do this by wedging a triple-folded cardboard bus ticket under one side of the bowl''s
  base. When all the figs have been eaten and the bowl is empty, smash it, but do
  not smash it in the fireplace. There should be a cordon sanitaire around the fireplace
  from the week of Packaging Gnawed By Stoats to the week of Notorious Civil Engineering
  Scandals. Shoelaces ought to be tied according to the Winckelmann formula. Diagrams
  for guidance can be downloaded from the website at:
