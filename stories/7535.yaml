text: "For no reason whatsoever, I feel it is high time we enjoyed once again dance\
  \ critic Wilma Salisbury's report of the \u201Ccrumpled Jesuit\u201D Father Bob\
  \ VerEecke's magnificent performance, as recorded in The Plain Dealer in July 1999.\
  \ Below, a priceless snap of Father Bob putting his students through their paces.\n\
  As an introduction to the Jesuit priest's choreography, Kahn performed Overwhelmed,\
  \ an expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested sacred dance\
  \ only in a few gestures of prayer. Set to a recording of prepared piano music by\
  \ John Cage, the brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as\
  \ the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared, and VerEecke\
  \ had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried\
  \ out to God, ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fists against\
  \ the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical\
  \ movements by ten dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in VerEecke's\
  \ workshop.\n\n[2011-11-06]"
