text: "Parts One, Two, and Three. And now, Part Four \u2026\nButtercase's map of Sumatra\
  \ was his first and, arguably, finest cartographic achievement. Having abandoned\
  \ his shipmates, his first step was to enter the general store in Blimbing, and,\
  \ using the small sum of cash he had stolen from the purser's hatbox, he bought\
  \ a knapsack, some cakes, a compass, a shirt, a fetching little hat, a jar containing\
  \ a substance no longer obtainable on earth, although it was quite common at the\
  \ time, a guide-book, some clips, a lead-lined smock, and a windjammer, among other\
  \ things. Then he set out on foot to cover the whole island. It took him five years.\
  \ He began by keeping to the coastal routes, tramping from Blimbing all the way\
  \ up to Oleleh, then along the eastern coast, through Edi, Balei, and Rupat until,\
  \ once past Telok Betong, he returned to his starting-point. He took the opportunity\
  \ to call in to the general store and have his clips de-rusted and his hat stitched.\
  \ Then he headed off into the interior, zigzagging his way nor'east, nor'west, nor'east,\
  \ nor'west, until he reached Segli. All this time he had been taking copious notes,\
  \ and he was now ready to begin work on his map. He returned to Blimbing on a motorbike\
  \ and holed up in a shack. Sustained by Rumanian beans and hooch, he worked for\
  \ a further two years, using an enormous sheet of Waterbath paper and a collection\
  \ of coloured pencils. A stupendously detailed description of the map appears in\
  \ Crone's Anthology Of Sumatran Maps Concocted By Felons (Hooting Yard Press, 1937),\
  \ to which the reader is referred.\nBut that's quite enough about maps for the time\
  \ being. Of more interest is the fact that at around this time Buttercase fell in\
  \ with a gang of ne'er-do-wells who haunted the more disgusting sinks of vice and\
  \ iniquity in Blimbing and, when it was learned that he was an accomplished accordionist,\
  \ he was invited to join their jazz band. The band was led by the scrofulous but\
  \ benign cornettist Lip Suk Jab, a Korean who had been hounded out of his country\
  \ following the infamous Unserrated Postage Stamp Scandal of 1922. Suk Jab's musical\
  \ gifts were slight, but what he lacked in technique he made up for with what can\
  \ only be described as stage presence. Slightly less than five-feet tall and impossibly\
  \ rotund, he held audiences in thrall. Several critics have attempted to explain\
  \ precisely what it was about the man that was so spellbinding. Was it his occasional\
  \ impersonations of Constantin Brancusi or Cicely Courtneidge? Was it the metal\
  \ harness he strapped to his head which emitted incandescent light? Was it the pocketfuls\
  \ of custard triangles with which he showered the audience at the end of each show?\
  \ Who can say? What we do know is that, when his regular accordionist was drowned\
  \ in a freak dandelion-hammering accident, he cajoled Buttercase into joining his\
  \ band.\nThe next thirty years passed in a whirl. Cartography was all but forgotten\
  \ as Suk Jab's band\u2014known variously as The Crumpled Ships, The Amnesiac Lane\
  \ Octet, Lip Suk Jab And His Big Aluminium Kettle, Shimmying In Ponds, The Norwegian\
  \ Hooters, or Go Wild With Lip Suk Jab And The Mullet Babies\u2014toured endlessly\
  \ through Sumatra, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, Timor, and the Yukon. There were shows\
  \ virtually every night of the week, in hotels, dancehalls, casinos, scout-huts,\
  \ community centres, bingo parlours, caves, factories, deserted mineshafts, and\
  \ temples. Lacquered gits clutching recording contracts followed the band everywhere.\
  \ Broadcasters from the burgeoning Dutch East Indies Radio Corporation were forever\
  \ dragging the band into studios. Buttercase took up the bassoon and the ondes martenot\
  \ in addition to his favoured accordion, although he was never able to play either\
  \ of them with much conviction.\nThis idyll ended on 14th January 1959, when disaster\
  \ struck. The band, billed as The Authentic Sound Of Geriatric Slobbering, were\
  \ booked to play at the Fop Palace, a nightclub in Selwyn, hard by the banks of\
  \ the Macmillan, which had become the in place to be for the local population of\
  \ trappers, Mounties, card-sharps, detectives, rustlers, and circus performers.\
  \ The journey from Borneo had been exhausting, and half the band had contracted\
  \ dengue fever. Lip Suk Jab himself was under investigation by the Javan Secret\
  \ Police following his involvement in a stamp collecting scam, and had become convinced\u2014\
  rightly\u2014that agents pursued him at every step. Indeed, on the night in question,\
  \ eleven Javan plainclothesmen were loitering in the snug bar at the Fop Palace,\
  \ ready to make an arrest. As if this were not trouble enough, Buttercase's accordion\
  \ had been sabotaged by thugs employed by a rival Sumatran jazz combo; as soon as\
  \ he played an F sharp, explosives secreted within the instrument would detonate,\
  \ blasting the accordion, its player, and anyone and anything else within a five-hundred\
  \ yard radius to smithereens.\nBy quarter to midnight, when the band were due to\
  \ begin their set, the Palace was packed. The Javans, skilfully disguised as a group\
  \ of Lithuanian business executives, had fanned out from the snug and taken up strategic\
  \ positions around the stage and at the exits. Never one to tolerate sickness, Lip\
  \ Suk Jab had summarily dismissed the dengue-stricken members of the group and was\
  \ busy rehearsing four locals in a back room. None of the callow Yukon youths had\
  \ ever played a musical instrument before, but so awe-inspiring was Suk Jab's tuition\
  \ that, by the time the lights went down, Biff, Skip, Chump, and Dib felt confident\
  \ enough to attempt the banjo, tuba, sackbut, and kettledrums respectively. The\
  \ locals gave them a rousing cheer, which was only slightly muted when they were\
  \ followed on stage by Buttercase and the other two long-serving band members, whose\
  \ names we may learn later. The seven of them started to bash out a scorching opener\
  \ designed to set the scene for the arrival of their leader. You will be pleased\
  \ to learn that Buttercase played the bassoon on this number. The deadly accordion\
  \ rested behind him on a rather intriguing stool, carved entirely from the tusk\
  \ of a narwhal and engraved with scenes of piracy and racketeering. He had received\
  \ this piece of scrimshandy from a Bolton mustard merchant after a concert in Wetter\
  \ in 1946.\nTowards the end of the number, Lip Suk Jab made his way towards the\
  \ stage. As he paused to screw the last bolt into his incandescent metal head-harness,\
  \ four of the Javans pounced. Before he knew what had hit him, the cornettist was\
  \ gagged, handcuffed, and frogmarched out by a side exit into the wintry Selwyn\
  \ night. The rest of the Javan detectives joined them, and they hurried down to\
  \ the banks of the Macmillan, which was of course entirely frozen over. Hastily\
  \ lacing up their ice-skates, and muttering incomprehensible messages into their\
  \ walkie-talkies, the agents careered across the river at breakneck speed, narrowly\
  \ avoiding bashing Lip Suk Jab's head into an ice-trapped tugboat in midstream.\
  \ Once they had made it to the other side, they put the cornettist back on his feet\
  \ and, having removed their skates, ordered him to march with them four miles to\
  \ the airfield where their bi-plane was waiting. As they set off, midnight struck.\n\
