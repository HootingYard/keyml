text: "The slack-jawed dribbler drooled as he danced. In spite of his dribbling and\
  \ drooling, he executed as fine a waltz as any man alive. His partners, fey ladies\
  \ prone to fits of the vapours, learned to wear protective shawls, of plastic or\
  \ rubber, to parry the drool. It was viscous drool that dribbled from his slack\
  \ jaw. We do not have time here to delve into his innards and their startling chemistry\
  \ to explain the equally startling viscosity of his drool, suffice to say he had\
  \ been studied by boffins, who found him fascinating, though they cared not a jot\
  \ for his waltzing. But perhaps they ought to have cared, and investigated, for\
  \ it may be that there was a link, unsuspected but adamantine, between his anomalous\
  \ innards and his terpsichorean talent.\nBecause of his drooling, the slack-jawed\
  \ dribbler was a man of few words. It was said that he expressed himself more fully\
  \ in the waltz than he could ever manage with words. When he spoke, he slurred and\
  \ slurped and his eyes grew wild. The fey ladies shuddered or swooned, and who can\
  \ blame them? It is also true that he had no conversation, of the kind suitable\
  \ for tea dances and soir\xE9es. He had fixed views on two or three topics of limited\
  \ interest, and these he expounded, so far as his drooling and slurring and slurping\
  \ allowed, in a low monotone indistinguishable at times from the buzz of a distant\
  \ swarm of hornets.\nAnd hornets were indeed one of his topics of interest, along\
  \ with taxidermised plovers and steam power. He was learned, but limited in his\
  \ learning, as if mighty ramparts of concrete surrounded his mind. This, too, may\
  \ have been connected to the curious chemical reactions within his innards. It does\
  \ nothing to explain his waltzing, which was a wonder.\nHe haunted the drawing-rooms\
  \ I myself haunted for a decade or more. I always stood on the other side of the\
  \ room, peering at him through my binoculars from the shadows. I studied him as\
  \ one might study a bluebottle fly, or one of the worms. But before I could reach\
  \ any conclusions, one afternoon he was no longer to be seen, dancing so elegantly\
  \ across the parquet. He was gone, and nobody ever spoke of him. The fey ladies\
  \ took up with other dancing partners, men with medals and moustaches who did not\
  \ drool. I had neither medals nor a moustache. I had just my binoculars. And with\
  \ the slack-jawed dribbler gone, I trained them upon other subjects. But I trained\
  \ them in vain, for by now the lenses were cracked and smudged, and all I saw was\
  \ blurs.\nThen they ejected me from the drawing-rooms, and barred me for the future.\
  \ I sought the slack-jawed dribbler high and low, mon semblable, mon fr\xE8re!,\
  \ \_but I never tracked him to his lair. I made my own lair, in a horrible cave,\
  \ and here I'll stay.\n[2010-12-02]"
