  \ at the bowl set before him, his eyes glistening like globs of molten fire. Or\
  \ rather, his eye, for he had just the one. He had plucked out its twin, years ago,\
  \ in an act of penitence for sins as despicable as his noodles.\n\u201CThey are\
  \ the last noodles in the monastery pantry, Father,\u201D said the monk.\n\u201C\
  I am a Monsignor!\u201D shouted the priest, \u201CAnd you will address me as Your\
  \ Magnificence!\u201D\nHe was a very shouty Monsignor.\n\u201CForgive me, Monsignor,\
  \ but I do not think that is the correct form of address for your station within\
  \ the hierarchy of the Church,\u201D said the monk. Deftly, he placed a pair of\
  \ chopsticks next to the bowl. \u201CNow eat up before your noodles go cold.\u201D\
  \nThe Monsignor's eye burned with even greater ferocity and he banged his fist upon\
  \ the table. He had only the one fist, for the arm to which its twin had once formed\
  \ the extremity had been ripped from its socket, years ago, in an agricultural mishap.\n\
  \u201CCold and despicable noodles!\u201D he shouted, \u201CIs this how you welcome\
  \ My Magnificence to your shabby abbey?\u201D\n\u201CThis is a monastery rather\
  \ than an abbey, Monsignor,\u201D replied the monk, tucking a bib of golden cloth\
  \ under his superior's chin, \u201CAnd though the shabbiness of its fabric is unarguable,\
  \ our souls are pure, or at least as pure as constant and hysterical prayer can\
  \ make them.\u201D\nThe Monsignor swept the bowl aside with his one forearm, and\
  \ it clattered to the floor, strewing the noodles all kim kam. The bowl did not\
  \ break, for it was made of tin.\n\u201CBring me better noodles!\u201D he shouted,\
  \ \u201CAnd serve them in a ceramic bowl!\u201D\n\u201CI am afraid I cannot accede\
  \ to your request,\u201D said the monk, \u201CFor as I have explained, these noodles\
  \ were the last in the pantry, and our stocks are now exhausted. As for the bowl,\
  \ it has perhaps escaped your Monsignorial notice that we are a tinny monastery,\
  \ and quite, quite potless.\u201D\nAs he spoke, the monk used a broom to sweep the\
  \ strewn noodles back into the bowl, which he replaced in front of the Monsignor.\n\
  \u201CThere,\u201D he said, or cooed, \u201CNo harm done. Tuck in.\u201D\nThe monk\
  \ was going to add a jaunty remark about mishaps in a monastery refectory being\
  \ far less traumatic than agricultural mishaps, comparing the circumstances and\
  \ ramifications of both, but before he could do so the Monsignor started shouting\
  \ again.\n\u201CWhat filth has been commingled with these noodles as you swept them\
  \ back into the bowl from your refectory floor?\u201D he roared, with such titanic\
  \ rage that his whole body trembled and the bib of golden cloth came loose. The\
  \ monk gently tucked it back into place.\n\u201CI grant there is filth on our floor,\
  \ Monsignor, but rest assured it is mild filth, the odd pock of dust and perhaps\
  \ a few million harmless bacteria. Who knows, they may add a certain piquancy to\
  \ your noodles.\u201D\nThe Monsignor's countenance, already florid, now took on\
  \ the tint we imagine a painter might use to depict the fires of hell.\n\u201CThese\
  \ noodles were despicable when first you set them before me!\u201D he shouted, \u201C\
  And now they are doubly despicable! You have the gall to make My Magnificence feed\
  \ on dust and bacteria as well?\u201D\n\u201CMonsignor,\u201D said the monk, his\
  \ patience almost inhuman, \u201CThere are paupers in the hovels surrounding our\
  \ monastery who would happily lick that tin bowl clean. Might I suggest you take\
  \ off all those bright-bejewelled rings on your fingers the better to manipulate\
  \ the chopsticks?\u201D\n\u201CSpeak not to me of paupers!\u201D boomed the Monsignor,\
  \ \u201CI swept past their hovels astride my horse on my way here! Had I still a\
  \ second arm I would have used it to cut them down with a mighty Monsignorial sword!\u201D\
  \n\u201CAll well and good if it please you,\u201D said the monk, \u201CBut slaughtering\
  \ paupers, even in thought only, is hungry work, as many a baron and brigand can\
  \ attest, so you really ought to gobble up those noodles while they're lukewarm.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhere are all the other monks?\u201D shouted the Monsignor, changing the\
  \ subject suddenly, to distract attention from the fact that now he began sliding\
  \ the bright-bejewelled rings off his fingers using his teeth, prepatory to picking\
  \ up the chopsticks and eating the contents of his tin bowl. His hunger had defeated\
  \ his pride.\n\u201CDon't you worry your little head about them,\u201D said the\
  \ monk. It was his first error, in this battle of wits to force the bowl of noodles\
  \ and dust and bacteria down the Monsignor's gob. If there was one thing the Monsignor\
  \ was sensitive about, to the point of psychosis, it was the size of his head. Once,\
  \ it had been of average adult human head dimension, but following a missionary-among-jungle-tribesmen\
  \ mishap, years ago, it had been shrunk to the size of a potato. A bigger than average\
  \ potato, but a potato nevertheless.\nOnce again sending the bowl clattering across\
  \ the floor with a sweep of his forearm, the Monsignor rose from his stool and clumped\
  \ out of the refectory on his crutches, shouting incoherent imprecations as he went.\
  \ Outside, in the rain, his tubercular yet elegant horse was waiting. He mounted\
  \ it, slotted his crutches into the panniers, and hi-ho'ed away, towards a different\
  \ monastery, surrounded by different hovels, where he hoped to be fed less despicable\
  \ noodles.\nIn his tantrum, he had forgotten to retrieve his bright-bejewelled rings.\
  \ The monk gathered them from the table, and later that day, when it had ceased\
  \ to rain, he squelched out into the muck and distributed them among the paupers,\
  \ first insisting that they kneel down and pray, constantly, hysterically, and at\
  \ so high a pitch of frenzy that miles away, sitting down to a supper of picable\
  \ noodles in the refectory of a nunnery, the Monsignor thought he could hear the\
  \ shrieking of the damned. It was a din that delighted him. As he swallowed the\
  \ last noodle from his ceramic bowl, he grinned, a grin somehow wider than his tiny\
  \ head allowed, and so terrifying that the nun who served him his noodles swooned.\n\
