text: "There is a story I remember from my childhood called \u201CThe Brass-Necked\
  \ Goose\u201D. Or rather, I remember the title, but not much of the story itself.\
  \ As far as I recall it involved a goose that was ordinary in all particulars except\
  \ that its neck was made of brass. One accepts such improbabilities as a child,\
  \ as indeed one continues to accept them, when grown, if the spinner of improbable\
  \ tales is a skilled one.\nIf, for instance, a Latin American magical realist with\
  \ a clutch of literary awards under his or her belt introduces into a fat novel\
  \ a goose with a neck of brass, we might have a moment where we say \u201Cpish!\u201D\
  \ or \u201Cpshaw!\u201D, we might even chuck the book across the room into the fireplace,\
  \ but more likely, given the laurels with which the writer is garlanded, we will\
  \ accept the goose and read on, dazzled by the author's inventiveness.\nOn the other\
  \ hand, if we are reading a book by some lesser-known writer, and one, say, whose\
  \ infelicities of style and bone-headed stupidity have already tempted us to chuck\
  \ the book into the fireplace, and then, as we are growing increasingly exasperated,\
  \ a goose with a brass neck is introduced for no compelling reason on page 114,\
  \ then \u201Cpish!\u201D or \u201Cpshaw!\u201D are going to be the mildest expletives\
  \ with which we will erupt, accompanied no doubt by curses unsuitable for delicate\
  \ ears. We will also be likely not only to give in to the temptation and to chuck\
  \ the book into the fireplace after all, but to ensure that a roaring fire is blazing\
  \ therein, the better to obliterate this farrago of printed nonsense from our memories.\n\
  But as children, we do not care two pins for the literary reputation of the writer,\
  \ and we are immune to infelicities of style and even to bone-headed stupidity.\
  \ As children, we are caught up in the story, however improbable, however ill-written.\
  \ For one thing, we are probably not reading but being read to, by Mama, as we lie\
  \ tucked snug in bed, our bellies warm with milk, our eyes fixed on the paper stars\
  \ glued to our bedroom ceiling. When we are told that Ipsy Dipsy, limping along\
  \ the lane, meets a goose with a brass neck, we simply accept that this is the kind\
  \ of thing that happens to Ipsy Dipsy, and might even happen to us, if ever we find\
  \ ourselves walking along a country lane, unlikely as that may be given that we\
  \ live in a hideous urban sprawl with barely a sprig of greenery to be seen.\nI\
  \ said I could not recall the story, but see! see!, I have remembered Ipsy Dipsy\
  \ and the lane. Little details reappear in my mind's eye. I remember Ipsy Dipsy's\
  \ pointy red hat, and the callipers on his legs, for Ipsy Dipsy was a cripple, at\
  \ least at the beginning of the story. I remember the lane, it was a lane like the\
  \ avenue at Middelharnis painted by Hobbema. Was Ipsy Dipsy Dutch, or Flemish? Was\
  \ he still wearing the callipers at the story's end, or had he been able to cast\
  \ them aside, to throw them happily into a ditch, on account of some magical cure\
  \ effected by the goose? Did the goose's magic powers inhere in his brass neck?\n\
  As quickly as the memories come shimmering, like the paper stars on the ceiling\
  \ long ago, so, equally quickly, they fade, like the stars will fade in the heavens.\
  \ The night sky will be black, and vast, and pitiless. And I will totter about,\
  \ fumbling in the darkness, aged and exhausted, knowing that there will be no brass-necked\
  \ goose to save me from extinction.\nOriginally posted in 2014.\n[2017-12-17]"
