text: "\nA missive arrives from Dr Ruth Pastry:\nSo then, Mr Key, I have just had\
  \ the dubious pleasure of reading Old Key's Almanacke in today's Dabbler. I note\
  \ that in your prognostications for the coming year you failed to mention birds.\
  \ Knowing, as I do, that you are a man of exceeding ornithological perspicacity,\
  \ this came as something of a surprise. You will protest that eggs get a mention,\
  \ in October, but as I need hardly tell you, eggs are not birds. Some of them may\
  \ become birds, in due time, but that is beside the point.\nI myself would never\
  \ presume to foretell the future without first making a very careful study of our\
  \ wing-blessed friends. It is, I think, well known that accurate forecasts about\
  \ the future doings of princes and potentates and popes depend upon acute \u201C\
  reading\u201D of the various timbres of coos and caws and clucks and chirrups and\
  \ shrieks of all sorts of birds, not excluding budgerigars and pratincoles. Similarly,\
  \ by plucking and arranging in significant array the plumage of certain birds, including\
  \ avocets and owls, one gains eldritch insight into the likely outcome of the coming\
  \ year's important sporting fixtures. Of course, you need to know which type of\
  \ bird to pluck the feathers from, how to lay out the feathers upon a plain flat\
  \ surface, and, crucially, how to interpret the pattern thus formed.\nI do not claim,\
  \ however, to be a haruspex, for the simple reason that it is against my moral code\
  \ wilfully to slaughter a bird\u2014any bird\u2014that I might wrench out its entrails,\
  \ hot and bloody, for the sole purpose of fortune telling. I leave that kind of\
  \ thing to the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman.\nAnyway, I wish you a happy new year, whatsoever\
  \ may come to pass, and now I must dash, because the iFry I received as a Christmas\
  \ gift is wittering imbecilically upon every subject under the sun, and I shall\
  \ be driven insane unless I silence it by plunging it into a bucket of scum-coated\
  \ rainwater. Toodle pip!\n[2010-12-31]"
