text: "In Notes Pursuant To The Unravelling Of The Pamphleteer's Plum Plan, we saw\
  \ how Dobson believed he could learn about seeds by peering at them. Other than\
  \ suggesting \u201Centire afternoons\u201D as the length of time for a seed peering\
  \ session, much that we would wish to know remains unsaid. I suppose we can assume\
  \ that Dobson planned to peer at the seeds of a plum tree, but if he is right that\
  \ prolonged peering is in itself educational, one could, presumably, peer at any\
  \ seed, or seeds. The pamphleteer refers to \u201Cseeds\u201D in the plural, but\
  \ does not specify how many. And one is left uncertain whether, for example, he\
  \ envisages peering at a single, different seed on different afternoons, or at the\
  \ same array of unnumbered seeds each time. Nor are we told whether he would use\
  \ a powerful microscope. It would also have been helpful if Dobson could have given\
  \ some clue as to the type of surface on which his observed seed or seeds would\
  \ be deployed.\nI mention all these points because it seemed to me dubious in the\
  \ extreme that one would learn very much about seeds, or about anything else for\
  \ that matter, simply by peering at them. And yet who was I to doubt Dobson, unarguably\
  \ the most important pamphleteer of the twentieth century, albeit an out of print\
  \ one? I resolved to put this peering business to the test. Given the lack of detail\
  \ in Dobson's account, I had to improvise somewhat.\nI decided to buy a packet of\
  \ birdseed, partly in homage to the famous \u201Cphantom Dobson\u201D pamphlet,\
  \ and partly because, at the end of my experiment, I would have something to scatter\
  \ on the serried bird tables of Pointy Town, about which more later.\nI removed\
  \ a single seed from the packet, and placed it carefully on a piece of beige cloth\
  \ laid flat on the tabletop. I chose beige as it is the most neutral of colours.\
  \ Then I pulled up a chair and sat down, and plonked my elbows on the table and\
  \ rested my chin in my hands. Not having a microscope, powerful or otherwise, I\
  \ had to rely on my myopic eyes, peering at the seed through my spectacles. It was\
  \ morning, rather than afternoon, but that meant I had a longer period of daylight\
  \ to do my peering.\nI peered at the seed for nine hours. The following day, I placed\
  \ a handful of seeds on to the beige cloth and peered at them for five hours. The\
  \ next day, I took another single seed from the packet, laid it on a sheet of expensive\
  \ creamy notepaper, and peered at it for eleven hours. I continued seed peering\
  \ every day for two weeks, neglecting all other concerns, and varying the number\
  \ of seeds and the surface upon which they rested. One day I removed my spectacles,\
  \ to get a blurry perspective. When I wasn't peering at seeds, I made notes, not\
  \ on the expensive creamy notepaper, which I save for letters to dowagers and contessas,\
  \ but in a notebook I bought especially, on the cover of which I pasted a label\
  \ reading \u201CSeed Studies\u201D.\nSo was Dobson right? By the weird and eerie\
  \ Gods that stalk the land of Gaar, of course he was! When all my peering was done,\
  \ and I went a-scattering the birdseed on the serried bird tables of Pointy Town,\
  \ my brain was fat with seed-lore. I have a hard task ahead of me, but I aim to\
  \ marshal the notes in my Seed Studies notebook into a coherent text, to be issued\
  \ later this year, or perhaps next, as The Hooting Yard \u1E7Abertome Of Seeds.\
  \ I suspect it will make every other book about seeds ever published fit only for\
  \ the dustbin. And all thanks to Dobson, to whom, of course, the \u1E7Abertome will\
  \ be dedicated.\n[2009-07-12]"
