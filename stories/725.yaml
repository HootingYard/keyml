text: "Several readers have written in to ask if A Rustic Lesson is a genuine old\
  \ folk song, culled from a collection collected by a collector of old folk songs.\
  \ Figures such as Cecil Sharp and Percy Grainger and B\xE9la Bart\xF3k were fond\
  \ of traipsing the countryside jotting down the ululations of peasants, and my correspondents\
  \ wonder if the tale of the duck and the devil and the farmer comes from such a\
  \ source. Indeed it does. A Rustic Lesson was collected by Prudence Foxglove's cousin\
  \ Sagacity Wolfbag, a tireless explorer of rustic byways.\nIt is exactly one hundred\
  \ years since Sagacity published her anthology Filth & Muck & Fields Of Green, comprising\
  \ thousands of pages of songs and ballads, lore and legend, recipes and remedies,\
  \ proverbs, sayings and old saws, many if not all of them nonsensical. The bulk\
  \ of the material in the book was gathered in one tiny rustic backwater, a dismal\
  \ huddle of dilapidated huts in a field near the Blister Lane Bypass. Much of it\
  \ seems to have been relayed to Sagacity Wolfbag by a single, particularly grubby\
  \ peasant, who was probably in the throes of ergot-related hysteria, and who died\
  \ babbling in a ditch shortly after the anthology was published.\nThanks to R. for\
  \ alerting me to the existence of Sagacity Wolfbag.\n[2008-10-10]"
