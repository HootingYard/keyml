  Over at the super soaraway Dabbler this week I provide readers with some tips on
  how to make a homunculus. These miniature persons can be very helpful, if a bit
  eerie. Hooting Yard certainly couldn''t cope unless we had a little band of homunculi
  scurrying about taking care of business and protecting us from harm.
