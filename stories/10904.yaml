text: "The diary of an ignorant ornithologist, this day in 1946:\nI had arranged to\
  \ spend the morning birdwatching with Dennis, so shortly after daybreak I met him\
  \ as arranged at his \u201Chide\u201D. This is a small, low, concrete pillbox at\
  \ the edge of the marshes, from within which one has a sweeping view, but cannot\
  \ oneself be seen. I was very impatient to spot some birds, so no sooner had we\
  \ made ourselves comfortable than I snatched Dennis\u2019 binoculars and peered\
  \ through them.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I cried, \u201CA marsh warbler!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Really?\u201D said Dennis, \u201CLet me take a look.\u201D\nAnd he snatched back\
  \ the binoculars and peered through them. Then he emitted a great sigh, expressing\
  \ all at once pity and exasperation, bafflement and resignation.\n\u201CCleothgard,\u201D\
  \ he said, turning to look at me, \u201CJust because it is at a marsh and is making\
  \ a warbling sound does not make it a marsh warbler. Look again -\u201D and he handed\
  \ back the binoculars, \u201C- and tell me, is it bewinged? Does it have a beak\
  \ and feathers?\u201D\nI peered again, rapt, but had to confess that I was unable\
  \ to see any of these telltale bird features.\n\u201CWhat you can see,\u201D said\
  \ Dennis, \u201Cis not a marsh warbler. Granted, it is a living thing at a marsh\
  \ making little warbling sounds. But what in fact it is, is a little orphan child,\
  \ out roaming the marshes at daybreak, and warbling, or singing tremulously, perhaps\
  \ because it is a naturally cheerful orphan, or more likely from a nerve-racked\
  \ desire to drown out the eerie morning marshland sounds of gust and creak and slosh.\
  \ Hark now to the words of the little orphan's warbled song, and you will gather\
  \ why he is afeared.\u201D\nI pricked up my ears and listened carefully.\nTra la\
  \ la, tra la lee, sometimes I warble and sometimes I sulk\n  I hope I'm not accosted\
  \ by an escaped convict from the hulk\nAnd sure enough, as I watched I saw the orphan\
  \ of a sudden accosted by a fierce bedraggled chain-clanking convict, newly escaped\
  \ from a hulk moored out beyond the marshes. He bore a distinct resemblance to the\
  \ Scottish actor Finlay Currie.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I said, \u201CA cassowary!\u201D\
  \nDennis thumped me on the head with a brick.\n\nA cassowary and a marsh warbler\n\
