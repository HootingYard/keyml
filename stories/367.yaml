text: "From across the Atlantic, Hooting Yard podcast listener and aquatic ecologist\
  \ Darell Slotton writes with important news from the briny deep:\nHagfish are spectacularly\
  \ disgusting, being sea bottom, naked-looking, smooth, pink eels with a battery\
  \ of dodgy looking tendrils around the mouth. They burrow enthusiastically into\
  \ and through carcasses that fall to the bottom, until they are hollowed out. The\
  \ sight of a carcass bulging frenetically in the dim undersea light, with a dozen\
  \ of these lovelies inside, is\u2026 something. On top of that, if you keep hagfish\
  \ in an aquarium and reach in to pick them up, they instantly exude a chemical that\
  \ mixes with seawater to produce a huge ball of snot all around them, which you\
  \ are left holding as they slip away.\n\n\_\nHagfish diagram from Bigelow and Schroeder,\
