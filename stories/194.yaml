text: "I read somewhere last week that Mohammed is now the second most popular name\
  \ for newborn boys in the UK. It strikes me as a bit odd that you can get beheaded\
  \ for drawing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed, but it's perfectly fine to attach\
  \ his name to your son. Still, there is much about Islam that I find perplexing,\
  \ such as a recent fatwa in Egypt which allows an unmarried woman to work in an\
  \ office alongside men so long as she breastfeeds each of them five times to create\
  \ a familial bond. Now there's a sensible idea.\nAnyway, I was prompted to think\
  \ about boys\u2019 names, and more particularly what name I would ideally like to\
  \ see in the number one spot above Mohammed. Readers will know that I am very keen\
  \ on Sebag, but my current choice to become the most popular boys\u2019 name is\
  \ Suetonius.\nNot only is it a splendid, resounding name, but of course it also\
  \ commemorates the author of The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars. Suetonius\u2014whose\
  \ full name was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus\u2014can be seen as a kind of Dobson-like\
  \ figure, in that many of his works are terminally out of print. That is, they are\
  \ lost, possibly forever. We know that he wrote, among other things, Physical Defects\
  \ Of Mankind, Lives Of Famous Whores, and an essay on Critical Signs Used In Books,\
  \ but no trace of them survives. Luckily, we do have the rattling good read that\
  \ is The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars.\nGeorge Costanza, in Seinfeld, favoured the\
  \ names Soda and Seven, neither of which holds a candle to Suetonius in my opinion.\
  \ So if there are any expectant parents reading this, and your newborn is a boy,\
  \ do the decent thing and name him after the Roman Ur-Dobson. And mothers please\
  \ note! While I would recommend breastfeeding, it would probably be a good idea\
  \ to limit the milk supply to little Suetonius, rather than sharing it out among\
  \ those unprepossessing gits in the accounts department.\n[2007-06-13]"
