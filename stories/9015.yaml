text: "Ned! Ned! Prick up your ears, for you must listen out for the sound of clopping\
  \ hooves! It is a sound that betokens the coming of the preacher man astride his\
  \ horse. The horse has been shod with iron horseshoes by the fat florid farrier\
  \ at the fearsome fiery forge. While he waited for his horse to be shod the preacher\
  \ man stood by the horse trough in the market square, preaching. He preached of\
  \ a sulphurous vision of times to come, and the villagers trembled. Then the farrier's\
  \ urchin came running to tell him his horse was duly shod, and the preacher man\
  \ stalked off to the farrier and paid him for his labour and mounted his horse and\
  \ came a-clopping along the high ridge, silhouetted against the darkening sky. As\
  \ night fell, he dismounted from his horse and tied it with a halter to a sturdy\
  \ tree trunk by a brook, and he unrolled upon the ground his sleeping bag, a secondhand\
  \ sleeping bag that once had belonged to an Antarctic explorer. Then the preacher\
  \ man dipped his tin cup into the brook and gave water to his horse, and dipped\
  \ the tin cup again and drank it off, and then he made a fire using gathered sticks\
  \ and kindling. The moon looked down upon him, and he looked up at the moon. He\
  \ shook his fist at it, but shouted no imprecations, for he did not wish to cause\
  \ his horse alarm. The horse was timid.\nNed is tucked up in a makeshift bed on\
  \ the balcony. The stillness of the night is punctuated by the hacking of his cough.\
  \ Ned is tubercular, hence the balcony. His parents had not the means to send him\
  \ to a high and healthful Alpine sanitarium, but their simple home has a balcony,\
  \ so that is where they put him. Out there, he will be the first to hear the clopping\
  \ hooves of the preacher man's horse, when at last he comes a-calling. In the fug\
  \ of their parlour below stairs Ned's parents huddle around their radio, listening\
  \ to dance tunes by Xavier Cugat & His Orchestra, and to strange buzzes and whistles\
  \ and hisses and hums and crackles which interrupt the broadcast now and then, as\
  \ if some alien intelligence far away in the boundless firmament is trying to communicate\
  \ with them. There is a fire in the grate, made with gathered sticks and kindling,\
  \ and it crackles like the radio.\nThe preacher man tied a nosebag filled with feed\
  \ to his horse, and then he squatted by the fire and plucked from the griddle balanced\
  \ over it the sausages he had cooked for his supper. As he chewed, the stars twinkled\
  \ in the black sky. He could not bear to look up at them. He stared instead into\
  \ the fire, and saw imps and demons dancing, and souls in torment. The horse shuddered,\
  \ and kicked the sturdy tree trunk, but weakly. The preacher man had rescued it\
  \ from the knackers yard, paying a pittance to the knackerman. He had yet to give\
  \ the horse a name. In a pocket of his preacher's black suit, as black as the sky,\
  \ he had a list of the names of racehorses. He would pick one, all in good time,\
  \ for this horse, if it lived. Musing over the names of racehorses was sinful, but\
  \ like all men, he was a sinner. There was gristle in his sausages.\nIn the bed\
  \ upon the balcony, Ned, his ears pricked up to hear the clopping of hooves, should\
  \ they come clopping, cannot stir. He is tied to the bed with bindings. His parents\
  \ had listened to a radio programme in which Bl\xF6tzmann propounded his views on\
  \ the treatment of the tubercular. Several parts of it had been inaudible due to\
  \ buzzes and whistles and hisses and hums and crackles, and they had pieced together\
  \ afterwards what they understood. Balcony air, plenty of milk, and binding to the\
  \ bed. Ned hears nothing but the racking of his cough and the howling of distant\
  \ wolves. He stares up at the stars, and gives them names. In one of his pyjama\
  \ pockets he has a list of the names of racehorses, a list he has committed to memory,\
  \ and he passes his tubercular time allotting the names to the stars in the sky.\n\
  Morning came, and the preacher man kicked the embers of the fire and smeared his\
  \ face with the ashes. Birds were twittering in the trees, and he cursed them. He\
  \ had specific sets of curses for different types of birds, and he knew all their\
  \ songs, he had learnt them long ago at his mother's knee. He cursed his mother\
  \ too. He pictured her in her cell at the lunatic asylum, perched on an Alpine slope.\
  \ She would greet the morning with her own demented song. He was thankful he no\
  \ longer had to hear it. The horse was still asleep. The preacher man pissed into\
  \ the brook. He fought a craving to eat an eel for breakfast. He awoke his horse\
  \ and mounted it and set it a-clopping with a kick.\nAs dawn comes, Ned falls asleep,\
  \ bound to his balcony bed. Below, his parents tend to their cows and their poultry.\
  \ They keep their eyes peeled for the postman. They are expecting a parcel.\nOutshone\
  \ by the sun, the stars were no longer visible, so the preacher man could gaze up\
  \ at the heavens without fear. His horse clopped along, back on the high ridge,\
  \ out of the valley.\nNed's head is awash with dreams. He dreams of cows and poultry\
  \ and racehorses, all horribly intermingled, cows with chicken heads and racehorses\
  \ with beaks and feathers and chickens that snort like racehorses. Stars burst and\
  \ explode, birds sing, and alien beings from far in the boundless firmament buzz\
  \ and whistle and hiss and hum and crackle. And there comes a sound of the clopping\
  \ of hooves, at first very quiet, as if from afar, but it grows louder and louder,\
  \ closer and closer, and Ned wakes from his dreams, and still he hears the clopping\
  \ of hooves, and he rises as far as he can from his makeshift bed and weakly he\
  \ calls to his parents below, \u201CMa! Pa! I hear the clopping of hooves! The preacher\
  \ man is come!\u201D and the effort of calling makes him cough and cough, and he\
  \ collapses back on the bed on the balcony, thin and frail and tubercular. But his\
  \ parents do not hear him, for they have spotted the postman, in his little red\
  \ van, chugging along the lonely road below, and they run down the hill to wave\
  \ him to a halt.\nUp on the bridge, the preacher man's horse, exhausted, collapsed\
  \ beneath him.\nThe birds fall silent. The radio crackles. Ned coughs.\nThere is\
  \ no parcel from the postman today.\n[2012-04-28]"
