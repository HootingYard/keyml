text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I was intrigued, when reading your piece Fear\
  \ Of Squirrels, to come across the phrase \u201Cmarmaladeless morning\u201D. I have\
  \ not encountered this particular conjunction of words before. Could you tell me\
  \ what it means?\nI am only too happy to oblige, Tim. We may define a marmaladeless\
  \ morning as a morning without marmalade.\nFor many people, marmalade is an essential\
  \ and intrinsic part of their morning, when, for example, their breakfast menu includes\
  \ toast, and after the toast is buttered it is then spread with marmalade. Greedier\
  \ people, and those without table manners, may just spoon marmalade straight from\
  \ the jar into their mouths. We may tut at this practice, but cannot deny that it\
  \ happens, regrettable as it may be. The point is that, whether consumed spread\
  \ on toast (in a refined manner) or straight from the jar (in a disgusting manner),\
  \ marmalade is present at the breakfast table, and the morning is patently not marmaladeless.\n\
  We speak of marmaladeless mornings when the jar of marmalade is not present. This\
  \ can occur for several reasons. The jar may be languishing unloved on a shelf in\
  \ the pantry. Or the jar may be brought to the breakfast table, only for it to be\
  \ discovered that it is empty, or as near as dammit. In some circumstances, the\
  \ pantry, and related larders and cupboards, might be entirely innocent of marmalade.\
  \ This happens in what is known as a marmaladeless house.\nIf I may speak for a\
  \ moment of my own experience, I can say with some certainty that I have lived through\
  \ thousands of marmaladeless mornings. This is because toast and marmalade is not\
  \ one of my regular breakfasting items. As far as I know, it is not compulsory to\
  \ include toast and marmalade in one's breakfast, and thus I choose not to.\nOf\
  \ course, we can imagine a state or regime which makes it compulsory. In this nightmarish\
  \ situation, a marmaladeless morning would be a criminal offence. There would be\
  \ patrols of marmalade enforcement goons going door to door, barging into homes,\
  \ demanding evidence of marmalade. Woe betide the marmaladeless outlaw!\nFortunately,\
  \ this remains a dystopian fantasy. We are free to include or to exclude marmalade\
  \ from our breakfasts. We are even free to eschew the toast and scoff the marmalade\
  \ straight from the jar. We need not even make use of a spoon. We might simply dig\
  \ the marmalade out of the jar with our bare hands, stuffing our marmaladey fingers\
  \ into our mouths and licking and sucking until every last atom of marmalade is\
  \ shovelled down our gullets. Such a practice is visually arresting, if barbaric,\
  \ and one feels that a marmaladeless morning would be a small but necessary mercy\
  \ were we to witness it.\nThe twentieth century's greatest pamphleteer, Dobson,\
  \ wrote a fascinating essay entitled Marmalade\_: Does It Come In A Jar Or A Pot?\
  \ (out of print). Maddeningly, he fails to give a conclusive answer to his own question.\
  \ Instead, he veers off, over several hundred pages, into a frankly incoherent diatribe,\
  \ taking potshots\u2014or jarshots?\u2014at a variety of seemingly unrelated topics,\
  \ including aniseed, bleach, corrugated cardboard, dentists, egg-timers, flip-top\
  \ lids, gas, hags, ink, jam, kaolin (pig iron), loopy persons, Madagascar, nettles,\
  \ oxygen tents, passementerie, quips, rhubarb, sandwiches, talc, ullage, vipers,\
  \ weasels, xylophonists, yobboes, and zookeepers. We might concede that both jam\
  \ and sandwiches are somewhat relevant to the ostensible topic\u2014that is, in\
  \ case you have forgotten, marmalade\u2014but not in the way Dobson approaches them.\
  \ Believe you me, I have read the pamphlet from cover to cover, twice, and I can\
  \ make head nor tail of what he is going on about. But 'twas ever thus.\n[2016-09-19]"
