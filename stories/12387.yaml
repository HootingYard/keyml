text: "The other day, I was walking up and down the City Road when my weasel popped.\
  \ I ought to explain that I take Alan, my pet weasel, with me whenever I go trudging\
  \ through the city streets. He is a well-behaved weasel and does not need to be\
  \ kept on a leash. Usually, Alan will scurry just ahead of me, acting in some sorts\
  \ like a seeing-eye weasel. I am myopic rather than blind, and wear spectacles with\
  \ corrective lenses, so I do not actually need Alan to guide me, but I think it\
  \ makes him feel useful and important to do so. Studies have shown that weasels\
  \ do not generally suffer from low self-esteem\u2014heaven forfend that they should!\u2014\
  and perhaps I am being indulgent in allowing Alan to think I depend on him. But\
  \ that is my way.\nAnyway, there we were, somewhere up or down the City Road, more\
  \ or less within spitting distance of Moorfields Eye Hospital, when Alan suddenly\
  \ popped, as if he were a balloon. It was a most extraordinary sight, one I won't\
  \ forget in a hurry. One minute I was sashaying along with Alan scurrying just ahead\
  \ of me, on the lookout for something smaller than himself which he could rip to\
  \ bloody pieces with his claws and fangs, and then pop! there was a popping sound,\
  \ and all that remained of my pet weasel were a few shreds of fur and skin and bits\
  \ of bone on the pavement.\nNot knowing quite what to do, I spat in the direction\
  \ of Moorfields Eye Hospital. I do not as a rule condone spitting in the street.\
  \ It is a filthy habit practised by the lower orders and certain foreigners, one\
  \ which I abhor, but the popping of Alan had left my brainpans ajangle. I had read\
  \ somewhere, probably in an out of print pamphlet by Dobson, that to spit at a large\
  \ and important medical institution could, in some circumstances, clear the head\
  \ and help to determine a sensible course of action. How the pamphleteer dreamed\
  \ up such halfwittery is beyond me. The sole result of my spitting was that I was\
  \ Tasered by a passing copper.\nAs I sprawled, twitching and breathless, on the\
  \ pavement, there came a great thunderclap. And then it began to rain, great drenching\
  \ sheets pouring down from the heavens, washing away every trace of Alan that remained.\n\
  Above me, the copper was explaining that I was under arrest for antisocial behaviour\
  \ (the spitting), resisting arrest (lying sprawled instead of accompanying him to\
  \ the station) , and what he termed \u201Csundry other offences\u201D (undefined).\
  \ I reflected bitterly that Alan, had he not popped, would have slashed at the copper\
  \ and disfigured him, allowing me to make my getaway. But then I further reflected\
  \ that I would have been a fugitive from justice, me and my weasel, forced into\
  \ hiding, holed up in some weasel-friendly hotel, never more than one step ahead\
  \ of the law. That was no life for a boulevardier and his pet weasel.\nAnd then\
  \ it hit me that Alan was gone, gone forever, popped!, in an instant, and I was\
  \ alone. I held up my arms so the copper could cuff my wrists, and went quietly..\n\
  On City Road, in the pouring rain\n  Sprawled upon a paving stone\n  This man is\
  \ solitary, all alone\n  And there are jangles in his brain\n  His weasel popped,\
  \ and it was gone.\n  Da doo ron ron ron da doo ron ron.\n[2014-02-02]"
