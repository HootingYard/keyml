text: 'The sea, the sea, vast wet expanse! I sailed upon it with Captain Hans. Hans
  was German. He could not swim. He was stricken with a withered limb. An arm or a
  leg, I remember not. Memories make my brain grow hot. I live in the present, by
  the shore. I live outwith the rule of law. My only rules are those of the sea. Vast
  wet expanse! Come splish-splosh me!
