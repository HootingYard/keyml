text: 'Ahoy there, Frank!, writes Tim Thurn in his irritatingly over-familiar manner,
  I couldn''t help noticing that so far in this glorious new year you have treated
  us to your ruminations upon ducks, squirrels, and pelicans. This marks something
  of a change from your usual focus upon cows and pigs and bees, and I wonder if it
  signals an intention on your part to provide readers with an encyclopaedic survey
  of the entire animal kingdom over the coming twelvemonth. I would find this particularly
  useful, as, due to my education being interrupted by repeated concretions of the
  brain, much of my knowledge of the natural world has been gained by reading Hooting
  Yard. So I am well aware, for example, that pigs can be divided into two classes,
  real pigs and fictional pigs, and that pigs of both types can have the given name
  Popsy (or Popsie). I also know that goats can suffer from frequent fainting spells.
  However, I haven''t got a clue about, say, giraffes or bison or some of the tinier
  life-forms such as leafcutter ants and barely visible microscopic beings without
  eyes or even heads. Assuming my surmise is correct, I look forward to being well-versed
  in the world of beasts by January next, and all thanks to you! Yours ever, Tim.

  Well, I hate to disappoint, but I fear Tim has jumped to an erroneous conclusion.
  The recent pieces on ducks and squirrels and pelicans were all occasioned by an
  abstruse formula for selecting subjects which I have been using for a couple of
  years now. It is theoretically possible that, within a year, the formula might throw
  up every single member of the animal kingdom, but that is as likely as a monkey
  typing out a novel by V S Naipaul.

  By the way, I didn''t see a single squirrel today. Alack and alay!
