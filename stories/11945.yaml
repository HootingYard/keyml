text: "I am indebted to Rob Howard for drawing to my attention the inscription which\
  \ the Assyrian king Ashur-nasir-pal II (884\u2014859 BC) had carved, repeatedly,\
  \ all over his palace. As Mr Howard says, it reminds us, in its verbosity and boastfulness,\
  \ of Prince Fulgencio, of whom you will have read here from time to time.\nThe so-called\
  \ Standard Inscription was carved across the centre of every wall panel in the North-West\
  \ Palace, forming a decorative band around each room. Occasionally, on narrow panels,\
  \ part of the text was omitted. Otherwise there was no significant variation and\
  \ the catalogue of royal titles, claims and achievements was simply repeated over\
  \ and over again.\n\nPalace of Ashur-nasir-pal, priest of Ashur, favourite of Enlil\
  \ and Ninurta, beloved of Anu and Dagan, the weapon of the great gods, the mighty\
  \ king, king of the world, king of Assyria; son of Tukulti-Ninurta, the great king,\
  \ the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, the son of Adad-nirari, the\
  \ great king, the mighty king, king of Assyria; the valiant man, who acts with the\
  \ support of Ashur, his lord, and has no equal among the princes of the four quarters\
  \ of the world; the wonderful shepherd who is not afraid of battle; the great flood\
  \ which none can oppose; the king who makes those who are not subject to him submissive;\
  \ who has subjugated all mankind; the mighty warrior who treads on the neck of his\
  \ enemies, tramples down all foes, and shatters the forces of the proud; the king\
  \ who acts with the support of the great gods, and whose hand has conquered all\
  \ lands, who has subjugated all the mountains and received their tribute, taking\
  \ hostages and establishing his power over all countries.\nWhen Ashur, the lord\
  \ who called me by my name and has made my kingdom great, entrusted his merciless\
  \ weapon to my lordly arms, I overthrew the widespread troops of the land of Lullume\
  \ in battle. With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered\
  \ like Adad the destroyer over the troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and\
  \ Nirib. I am the king who has brought into submission at his feet the lands from\
  \ beyond the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea, the whole of the land of\
  \ Laqe, the land of Suhi as far as Rapiqu, and whose hand has conquered from the\
  \ source of the river Subnat to the land of Urartu.\nThe area from the mountain\
  \ passes of Kirruri to the land of Gilzanu, from beyond the Lower Zab to the city\
  \ of Til-Bari which is north of the land of Zaban, from the city of Til-sha-abtani\
  \ to Til-sha-Zabdani, Hirimu and Harutu, fortresses of the land of Karduniash, I\
  \ have restored to the borders of my land. From the mountain passes of Babite to\
  \ the land of Hashmar I have counted the inhabitants as peoples of my land. Over\
  \ the lands which I have subjugated I have appointed my governors, and they do obeisance.\n\
  I am Ashurnasirpal, the celebrated prince, who reveres the great gods, the fierce\
  \ dragon, conqueror of the cities and mountains to their furthest extent, king of\
  \ rulers who has tamed the stiff-necked peoples, who is crowned with splendour,\
  \ who is not afraid of battle, the merciless champion who shakes resistance, the\
  \ glorious king, the shepherd, the protection of the whole world, the king, the\
  \ word of whose mouth destroys mountains and seas, who by his lordly attack has\
  \ forced fierce and merciless kings from the rising to the setting sun to acknowledge\
  \ one rule.\nThe former city of Kalhu, which Shalmaneser king of Assyria, a prince\
  \ who preceded me, had built, that city had fallen into ruins and lay deserted.\
  \ That city I built anew. I took the peoples whom my hand had conquered from the\
  \ lands which I had subjugated, from the land of Suhi, from the whole of the land\
  \ of Laqe, from the city of Sirqu on the other side of the Euphrates, from the furthest\
  \ extent of the land of Zamua, from Bit-Adini and the land of Hatte, and from Lubarna,\
  \ king of the land of Patina, and made them settle there.\nI removed the ancient\
  \ mound and dug down to the water level. I sank the foundations one hundred and\
  \ twenty brick courses deep. A palace with halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, box-wood,\
  \ meskannu-wood, terebinth and tamarisk, I founded as my royal residence for my\
  \ lordly pleasure forever.\nCreatures of the mountains and seas I fashioned in white\
  \ limestone and alabaster, and set them up at its gates. I adorned it, and made\
  \ it glorious, and set ornamental knobs of bronze all around it. I fixed doors of\
  \ cedar, cypress, juniper and meskannu-wood in its gates. I took in great quantities,\
  \ and placed there, silver, gold, tin, bronze and iron, booty taken by my hands\
  \ from the lands which I had conquered.\n[2013-09-10]"
