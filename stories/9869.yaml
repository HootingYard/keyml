text: "Before we leave the Olympic Games behind, I must get something off my chest.\
  \ I found myself aghast at the number of athletes who, when interviewed after their\
  \ triumph\u2014or failure\u2014spoke of the \u201Cjourney\u201D they had been on.\
  \ This journey was usually described as either amazing or incredible, or both. It\
  \ is a similar, or identical, journey to the one apparently undertaken by just about\
  \ anybody who appears in any kind of televised contest, be it a \u201Ctalent\u201D\
  \ show or one of those weird programmes where they lock people up in a house for\
  \ a few weeks. Somewhat terrifyingly, it is also the title of Tony Blair's memoir.\n\
  What we are supposed to understand from all this guff is that the speaker has been\
  \ on a journey of self-discovery. As John Lydon put it in Public Image, \u201CI'm\
  \ not the same as when I began\u201D. No doubt this is true, if not for brain-dead\
  \ television show contestants, certainly for Olympic athletes. What is profoundly\
  \ depressing is that they all reach for precisely the same metaphor, automatically.\
  \ It is not that I expect profundity, exactly, especially when the athlete is quizzed\
  \ while still puffing and panting fresh from the running track or swimming pool.\
  \ But there were times when I thought the BBC might have used a generic puffing-and-panting\
  \ cardboard cutout for all the interviews, because they all said exactly the same\
  \ thing. The questions were pretty witless, but why did they all\u2014unprompted\u2014\
  blather about their incredible/amazing \u201Cjourney\u201D?\nOur medallists would\
  \ do well to listen, as I have done, to an old tape-recording of fictional athlete\
  \ Bobnit Tivol. It was made in the days before television, of course, and before\
  \ round-the-clock news and mass media attention. The interviewer was a hack from\
  \ a local newspaper, and the race fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol had just won was\
  \ the second heat of a qualifier for the quarter finals of the Blister Lane Bypass\
  \ Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree ten mile dash. You will note that nowhere\
  \ does the fictional champ mention a \u201Cjourney\u201D.\nHack \u2013 Fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol, you've just won the second heat qualifier for the quarter\
  \ finals of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree ten mile\
  \ dash. Congratulations!\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Puff. Pant.\nHack\u2014\
  It was a tremendous race. How do you feel, having won it?\nFictional athlete Bobnit\
  \ Tivol \u2013 Puffed out and faintly nauseous.\nHack\u2014For a moment there on\
  \ the sixteenth lap when your laces came undone things looked decidedly calamitous.\n\
  Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014I would agree. But this was an occurrence I\
  \ had been through with my coach, the all too real Old Halob. He drummed into me\
  \ the need to stop, kneel down, retie my laces, give them a little tug to ensure\
  \ they were sufficiently tight, and then stand up and start running again, but faster\
  \ than I had been running before the calamity.\nHack\u2014A lesson it seems you\
  \ learned well.\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Indeed so. As I say, we went\
  \ through it time and time again during my rigorous training sprints, usually before\
  \ dawn, across the moors, pursued by packs of wolves and other savage and speedy\
  \ creatures Old Halob keeps caged and half-starved and then releases to chase me\
  \ across the moors before dawn with chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as part\
  \ of my rigorous training sprints in preparation for races such as this one which\
  \ I have just won.\nHack\u2014What are the other savage and speedy creatures, other\
  \ than wolves?\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol \u2013 It depends on what Old Halob\
  \ can procure from the local menagerie. Yapping dogs, gazelles, stoats . . .\nHack\u2014\
  And which cuts of meat are tied to your heels?\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014\
  That is between Old Halob and his favourite butcher.\nHack\u2014I am sure the readers\
  \ of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree Annual Newsletter\
  \ And Recipe Leaflet would be fascinated to know who that butcher is.\nFictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Old Halob would probably tell you if you paid him a\
  \ stipend.\nHack\u2014I might just do that. Where can I find him?\nFictional athlete\
  \ Bobnit Tivol\u2014As I crossed the finishing line in front of the other runners\u2014\
  sorry, I mean runner\u2014I think I saw him trudging off towards that kiosk over\
  \ there to buy a carton of cigarettes. If you run a bit faster than I was running\
  \ just now you might catch up with him before he heads off to the owl sanctuary\
  \ to indulge in his usual post-race activity of communing with owls while smoking\
  \ heavily.\nHack\u2014Righty-ho! Well done again, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol!\n\
  Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Thank you, hack. Now I must do several laps\
  \ of honour before sprinting off across the moors pursued by packs of wolves and\
  \ other savage and speedy creatures with chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as\
  \ part of my rigorous training regime.\nWhat strikes us about this scratchy and\
  \ hissy old magnetic tape-recording is the complete absence of the words amazing\
  \ and incredible and, indeed, journey. It is worth noting, too, that as far as we\
  \ can tell fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol sheds no tears, and indeed does not even\
  \ seem to be welling up. It is of course possible that he began sobbing as soon\
  \ as the hack set off in pursuit of Old Halob, but spectacularly unlikely.\nThe\
  \ tape continues, and we hear the hack hailing Old Halob somewhere between the cigarette\
  \ kiosk and the owl sanctuary. His hailing is followed by a series of thumps, which\
  \ acoustic analysis suggests are the sound of a catarrh-racked irascible athletics\
  \ coach's fist repeatedly meeting the jaw of a hack employed by the Blister Lane\
  \ Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree Annual Newsletter And Recipe Leaflet.\
  \ There is then the sound of various owls hooting.\n[2012-08-13]"
