text: "To keep flies off your paintings and hangings. An Italian conceipte both for\
  \ the rareness and use thereof doth please me above all other: viz: pricke a cowcumber\
  \ full of barley corns with the small spring ends outwards, make little holes in\
  \ the cowcumber first with a wooden or bone bodkin, and after put in the grain,\
  \ these being thicke placed will in time cover all the cowcumber, so as no man can\
  \ discerne what strange plant the same should be. Such cowcumbers to be hung up\
  \ in the middest of summer rooms to drawe all the flies unto them, which otherwise\
  \ would flie upon the pictures or hangings.\nHugh Plat, Delightes For Ladies, c.1602\n\
  Hugh Plat\u2026 does not quite make it clear that the wheat stuck into the cucumber\
  \ would quickly sprout and cover the fruit in a coat of young shoots. This must\
  \ have looked like some exotic sea creature hanging from a chandelier at the centre\
  \ of a room. It would, no doubt, have grown increasingly strange as the cucumber\
  \ gradually dried and rotted, and the barley shoots withered.\nfrom The Curious\
  \ Cookbook : Viper Soup, Badger Ham, Stewed Sparrows & 100 More Historic Recipes\
  \ by Peter Ross (2012). I thoroughly recommend this splendid new book, published\
  \ by the British Library, not least because Dr Ross is my oldest friend\u2014we\
  \ met when we were eleven years old. Obtain a copy, and you too will be able to\
  \ make what is possibly the world's most complicated recipe\u2014cheese and biscuits\
  \ (with chutney) \xE0 \_la Jack Warner. Yes, that Jack Warner, beloved by all as\
  \ Dixon of Dock Green.\n[2012-05-24]"
