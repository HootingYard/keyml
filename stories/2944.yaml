text: "A new academic year will begin soon, and all across the land anxious parents\
  \ will watch as fresh clumps of tinies skip through the school gates for the first\
  \ time. By now, most places have been allocated. But I am still receiving letters\
  \ seeking judicious Hooting Yard advice on what type of school is best. Often, my\
  \ correspondents seem deluded, for they bang on about so-called \u201Cfaith\u201D\
  \ schools, or Montessori schools, or even Steiner schools. Please remember that\
  \ the latter are based on the ideas of a man who believed in invisible gnomes.\n\
  There is of course only one type of institution to which the wet-behind-the-ears\
  \ infant ought to be entrusted, and that is a Dobson school. Named after the titanic\
  \ twentieth century out of print pamphleteer, these academies use pedagogic methods\
  \ devised, not by Dobson himself, but by Desdemona Ferncraze, a brilliant bluestocking\
  \ who was for many years responsible for the instruction of the inmates of Pang\
  \ Hill Orphanage.\nShortly after her arrival at Pang Hill, Dr Ferncraze, a voracious\
  \ reader of everything she could lay her hands on, contracted a common ague which\
  \ led to water on the brain, after which she became convinced that the sum of all\
  \ human\u2014and inhuman\u2014knowledge was to be found in the pages of Dobson's\
  \ pamphlets. Even the pamphleteer himself did not make such a claim, though he came\
  \ close to doing so in his slim work of 1953 The Death Of Stalin Has Led Me By Dense\
  \ Entangled Byways To The Unshakeable Conviction That A Complete And Thorough Pedagogic\
  \ System Can Be Based Entirely Upon My Own Pamphlets (out of print). Curiously,\
  \ it seems this was one work of Dobson's which Desdemona Ferncraze never read. She\
  \ developed her \u201Cmethod\u201D while lying in her sickbed on an upper balcony\
  \ of Pang Hill Orphanage, having instructed the gruesome brute Pepstow to dispose\
  \ of her entire library, save for the Dobson items, by shredding the books and feeding\
  \ them bit by bit to gulls and other scavenging birds. This he did, despite his\
  \ qualms, for he burned with a secret passion for the stricken bluestocking. Pepstow\
  \ was at his least gruesome and brutish when in her presence, though such was his\
  \ yearning that he became tongue-tied and could only grunt at her unintelligibly.\
  \ Dr Ferncraze herself was utterly oblivious to his blandishments, before and after\
  \ her ague, a circumstance of such pathos that it has been adapted for the screen\
  \ under the title Desperate Pang Hill Orphanage Brutes. For dramatic purposes, a\
  \ fictional rival brute has been inserted into the story, hence the plural.\nWhen\
  \ sufficient water on her brain had been evaporated using the Gillespie Head-Steaming\
  \ Procedure, Desdemona Ferncraze leapt from her sickbed and set about drilling the\
  \ Pang Hill orphans according to her new lights. Out went the wall-friezes of alphabets\
  \ and numbers and fluffy farmyard animals, out went the Good Citizenship And High\
  \ Self-Esteem Module Workbooks, and out went the Tuesday morning caterwauling. Instead,\
  \ each week was devoted to the memorising of the complete text of a Dobson pamphlet.\
  \ By midnight on Friday, scratching at their slates, every single tiny was expected\
  \ to be able to write out an accurate copy, including any marginalia that their\
  \ wild-eyed teacher saw fit to add. Those who failed were handed over to Pepstow,\
  \ who wreaked his gruesome brutality upon them down at the drainage ditch.\nDr Ferncraze's\
  \ astonishing discovery was that a firm grounding in the pamphlets of Dobson, memorised\
  \ in whatever order, fitted the orphans perfectly for lives as bumbling, distracted\
  \ polymaths given to lengthy walks along canal towpaths, chucking pebbles at swans,\
  \ just like the pamphleteer himself. With her boundless energy, she set up a network\
  \ of similar Dobson schools in and around Pang Hill, in derelict buildings and abandoned\
  \ campsites. They are still flourishing, if that is the word I am looking for, though\
  \ it probably isn't. Such a school is, without a jot of doubt, the perfect place\
  \ for the progeny of Hooting Yard readers.\n[2009-08-26]"
