  \ prompted much controversy. If big burly blokes who \u201Cidentify as\u201D women,\
  \ like \u201CDr\u201D Rhys/Rachel McKinnon, are allowed to compete in women's events,\
  \ what are the odds that, given their physical advantage, they will start winning\
  \ everything? There are already enough instances of this happening to make women's\
  \ prospects seem bleak.\nIt so happens that the future of women's sport was televised\
  \ almost half a century ago, on Monty Python's Flying Circus. In his fight against\
  \ Petula Wilcox, boxer Ken Clean-Air System is not explicitly identified as trans,\
  \ but of course those were far less enlightened times.\nClick on the link for (poor\
