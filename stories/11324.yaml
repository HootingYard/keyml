text: "\nI watched, and much enjoyed, Ben Wheatley's 2012 film Sightseers. Imagine\
  \ Keith and Candice Marie from Mike Leigh's Nuts In May as serial killers on the\
  \ rampage and that will give you some idea.\nFor all its pleasures, there was, however,\
  \ one small lapse which I point out because I think it is symptomatic of a broader\
  \ issue. There is a scene in which Chris (Steve Oram), the male lead, says \u201C\
  He's not a human being. He's a Daily Mail reader.\u201D The line guarantees a cheap\
  \ laugh from the audience, but it's all wrong, because the character being referred\
  \ to fits much more neatly the stereotype of a Guardian reader. But it is precisely\
  \ Guardian readers who are likely to form the audience for the film.\n\u201CHe's\
  \ not a human being. He's a Guardian reader\u201D is actually funnier, as well as\
  \ being more fitting. But the Guardianistas would then have to laugh at themselves,\
  \ something they're not very good at. Taking a swipe at the Daily Mail, on the other\
  \ hand, is easy. No thought required. It is similar to the depressing sight of Russell\
  \ Brand assuming he can win an argument with Peter Hitchens merely by saying Hitchens\
  \ writes for the Mail. Cue boos from the herd.\nWhile we are on the subject of comedy,\
  \ Douglas Murray has a good point to make about The Book Of Mormon. Easy enough\
  \ to elicit laughs at the expense of a preposterous sect, but it is not as if Mormonism\
  \ is in any way a feature of the cultural landscape in this country. As he says,\n\
  One reviewer called The Book of Mormon \u201Cdecadent\u201D and I know what he meant.\
  \ It does seem the epitome of a corrupted culture that you have to import alien\
  \ ideas to laugh at because you are too terrified to lampoon the alien ideas in\
  \ your own midst. You could get someone to write The Book of Muhammad. I would happily\
  \ write it myself. But we would not find a theatre, and even if we did the theatre\
  \ would not find an insurer, so the show would not go on.\nOh, incidentally, Sightseers\
  \ may be the knitting and catastrophe film par excellence.\n[2013-04-25]"
