text: "Nige has been rereading Pale Fire, and has inspired me to begin my own once-per-decade\
  \ revisit to Vladimir Nabokov's most magnificent novel. Just as Lolita has the finest\
  \ parenthetical phrase in all literature\u2014(picnic, lightning) \u2013 so Pale\
  \ Fire contains my absolute favourite sentence. If you have not yet read the book,\
  \ you should look away now, as they say on television\u2026\nIn itself, the sentence\
  \ is unremarkable. But in its context, its placement (at the end of the third paragraph\
  \ of the Foreword), and its startling, joyous, vertiginous effect, it has no peer.\n\
  There is a very loud amusement park right in front of my present lodgings.\n[2010-10-23]"
