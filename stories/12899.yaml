text: "One grim bright morning, Captain Nitty was walking along an imposing and expansive\
  \ boulevard when one of his lungs collapsed.\n\u201COof!\u201D he gasped, before\
  \ crumpling in an untidy angular heap upon the paving slabs. As he fell, his captainy\
  \ cap fell off his head, and, landing on its brim, rolled into the gutter, where\
  \ it was worried by a stray dog.\nThe dog had strayed from its owner, who was known\
  \ to Captain Nitty, though the dog was not. Captain Nitty had what is known as dog-blindness,\
  \ in that he could never perceive any dog with any of his five senses. So, even\
  \ had he had his wits about him, rather than being sprawled gasping on the pavement,\
  \ he would not have been aware of the dog gnawing and pawing his cap.\nLater, in\
  \ a bed on a ward in the clinic to where he had been ferried by a rickety and inefficient\
  \ ambulance, Captain Nitty asked the clinic chaplain, who was sitting at his bedside\
  \ telling the seven last words from the cross on his rosary beads, where his cap\
  \ was. The chaplain replied in Latin, a language with which Captain Nitty was unfamiliar.\
  \ What he said was, \u201CDo not interrupt me with questions about your cap when\
  \ I am praying for the salvation of your immortal soul through the words of Christ\
  \ in his last extremity\u201D.\nMeanwhile, the dog had carried the cap, in its mouth,\
  \ away from the boulevard to a patch of gorse and scrub over by the viaduct. Here,\
  \ it lost interest in the cap and deposited it in a puddle. Then it scampered off\
  \ to frighten some tiny tots gathered around a spooky fathomless inky-black pond.\n\
  Captain Nitty made a miraculous recovery and that very same day, at around teatime,\
  \ was back on his feet. He discharged himself from the clinic and went in search\
  \ of his cap. Does it bring tears to your eyes, the thought of him, bare-headed\
  \ and desperate, looking in all the wrong places, plagued by invisible dogs, day\
  \ after grim bright day, fruitlessly, fruitlessly, fruitlessly? It should.\n[2014-07-31]"
