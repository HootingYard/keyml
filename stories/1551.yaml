text: "Currently in preparation, The Hooting Yard Encyclopaedia Of Birds will prove,\
  \ I think, to be a majestic work of birdy scholarship destined to blow the roof\
  \ off the pretty little hut of contemporary ornithology. Apart from anything else,\
  \ it will include stuff about dozens of birds other avianists don't even know exist,\
  \ such as the lopwit. As a brief taster, here is part of the entry on the great\
  \ grey shrike:\n\nThe Latin name of the great grey shrike, Lanius excubitor, translates\
  \ into English as butcher sentinel. Whenever this bird is hereafter mentioned in\
  \ Hooting Yard, that is what it will be called, as in the sentence \u201COh look,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson, taking a pause from hammering a nail into a plank to no apparent\
  \ purpose, \u201CThere is a butcher sentinel singing its little heart out atop that\
  \ wooden pale.\u201D\n[2009-01-27]"
