text: "Tiptop pop group the Tiptop Toofles have released a new single which is steaming\
  \ towards the top of the charts. \u201CMy Monkey Has An Ague\u201D is a sprightly\
  \ yet forlorn ballad telling of the lead singer's pet monkey, Alan, being hospitalised\
  \ in a monkey hospital after contracting an ague. It is an odd sort of monkey hospital.\
  \ The lyrics make explicit that it is closely based on the hospital in a Carry On\
  \ film, so there are name-checks for Kenneth Williams as a doctor, Hattie Jacques\
  \ as Matron, and Charles Hawtrey as a weedy patient, languishing in the bed next\
  \ to the monkey's. So vivid is the picture painted by the words, though, that we\
  \ accept it and trust to its verisimilitude, even though, if we give it a moment's\
  \ sober thought, it is piffle.\nAs with all Tiptop Toofles tracks, it's a toe-tapper,\
  \ while at the same time being emotionally devastating. For those who have not yet\
  \ heard it, I will not spoil the song by giving away its ending. All I will say\
  \ is that, in the final verse, the scene changes from the monkey hospital to a monkey\
  \ graveyard.\nThe B side of the single is more smoochy than toe-tappy. \u201CApparent\
  \ rari nantes in gurgite vasto\u201D features the sampled voices of both Hattie\
  \ Jacques and Charles Hawtrey\u2014though not Kenneth Williams\u2014and is scored,\
  \ unusually for the Tiptop Toofles, or indeed for any other pop group, for Wurlitzer\
  \ organ, piccolo, and Brazil nuts. At eleven and a half minutes, it is by far the\
  \ longest track the group has ever released, and it is fair to say that it outstays\
  \ its welcome by a good ten minutes or so. This has not deterred top pop critic\
  \ Ted Popcrit from hailing it as \u201Cthe smoochiest B side ever committed to wax\
  \ cylinder recording technology that I have heard since yesterday afternoon\u201D\
  . Maddeningly, but characteristically, Ted does not divulge what he was listening\
  \ to yesterday afternoon, so I rang him up to ask.\n\u201CHello?\u201D I said, \u201C\
  Is that Ted Popcrit?\u201D\nBut in reply all I heard was a Lovecraftian bubbling\
  \ sound of \u201CGlub \u2026. glub \u2026 glub\u201D. I surmised that Ted must be\
  \ listening to the Tiptop Toofles\u2019 previous chart-topper, the sprightly yet\
  \ forlorn smoochy toe-tapper \u201CDisgusting Seaside Resort\u201D. Pop fans will\
  \ know that this smash hit features the sampled voices of Trevor Howard and Celia\
  \ Johnson, and that tremendous chorus \u201Cthe pollarded willows by the canal just\
  \ before the level crossing\u201D, so startling because it has nothing whatsoever\
  \ to do with seaside resorts.\nIf you would like to join the Tiptop Toofles Fan\
  \ Club, you are strongly advised to consult a qualified medical practitioner, or\
  \ a man of the cloth, whichever suits your pocket.\n[2017-02-13]"
