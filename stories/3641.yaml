text: "Oddly, I can find no Wikipedia entry for the Bl\xF6tzmann Dots. Odd, because\
  \ they are without question the most important dots of the past one hundred years.\
  \ They are, of course, odd in themselves. Bl\xF6tzmann always referred to them as\
  \ his \u201Codd dots\u201D, leaving it to the wider world to dub them with his own\
  \ name. Bl\xF6tzmann was by no means a modest man, but he had his moments of diffidence,\
  \ and the act of dot nomenclature was one of them.\nBl\xF6tzmann is thought to have\
  \ named the dots after Dot Tint, bluestocking sister of the noted mezzotintist Rex\
  \ Tint. In a particularly hectic twentieth-century year, Bl\xF6tzmann and Dot had\
  \ a fling, and it was when they were holed up in a love-nest in one of Ruskin's\
  \ favourite Swiss villages that Bl\xF6tzmann, one snowbound wintry weekend, first\
  \ conceived of the dots that would bring him fame.\nIt is possible that the dots\
  \ are not mentioned by the Wikipedia for security reasons. After all, it is their\
  \ military applications that have changed the world. These were not foreseen by\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmann, who is on record as stating that, initially at least, he considered\
  \ the dots of most benefit to gardening enthusiasts, potters, and hikers. It may\
  \ have been Dot Tint herself who, recognising the dots\u2019 versatility, sent a\
  \ sketch of them to a bigwig at a top secret intelligence facility. In interviews\
  \ later in life, she denied having done so, and it is perhaps one for the historians\
  \ to winkle out, now that Bl\xF6tzmann, Dot Tint, and indeed the military bigwig\
  \ are all doornail dead and have long since fed the worms in their respective burial\
  \ grounds.\n[2010-01-07]"
