  \ pirate would shout \u201CQuake with cold and fear the being that is myself planks\
  \ of wood cut to shape from trees!\u201D\nBut the prolix pirate was what is known,\
  \ in the technical jargon, as an unlettered matelot, and so his prolixity was improvised,\
  \ off the top of his head. His shipmate, the even more prolix pirate, was armed\
  \ with a battered old copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. He would shout \u201C\
  Tremble, shake, quiver; esp. to tremble with cold or fear the objective case of\
  \ the first person pronoun I reproducing the Old English accusative and dative wood\
  \ used for the building of houses, ships, etc., or for the use of the carpenter,\
  \ joiner, or other artisan; wood in general as a material; esp. after it has been\
  \ suitably trimmed and squared into logs, or further adapted to constructive uses!\u201D\
  \nYou can follow the adventures of the prolix pirates every week in the children's\
  \ comic The Ipsy Dipsy Doo (Prolix Edition), available from all good dealers in\
  \ newspapers and periodicals, esp. the owners of shops where these are sold; (now\
  \ also) the shop itself, usually also selling tobacco, confectionery, etc.\n[2017-02-04]"
