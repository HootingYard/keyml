text: "Upon waking this morning, my first thoughts, as ever on this date, were of\
  \ the Munich Air Disaster. Having sloshed ice-cold water on my head to dispel the\
  \ pangs of loss, I then happened to read an interesting piece about mezzotints,\
  \ which I recommend. Weirdly, it fails to mention the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint,\
  \ but you can rely on me to make good that omission. For what I recalled, over my\
  \ cornflakes \u2018n\u2019 egg \xE0 la Blavatsky, was that in the early months of\
  \ 1958 Rex Tint was busy with what came to be known as \u201Cthe cack-handed mezzotints\u201D\
  . This was a set of pieces which lack the sureness of touch and the dapper brilliance\
  \ of his best work, but are nevertheless of interest, no piece more so than this\
  \ rather clumsy mezzotint of the Busby Babes. So on this day, let us remember them,\
  \ and remember too Rex Tint, who lost his mojo, whatever that might be, over half\
  \ a century ago.\n\n[2010-02-06]"
