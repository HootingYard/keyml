text: "With two days remaining before bidding closes, I must remind you of this year's\
  \ Hooting Yard auction item for the Resonance104.4FM fundraiser. The highest bidder\
  \ will be immortalised forever by having their name (or that of a loved one) incorporated\
  \ into the title of an out of print pamphlet by Dobson. And not only that! They\
  \ will also be invited to attend the Resonance studio for the live broadcast of\
  \ the show when Mr Key reads the as yet unwritten story on air, and to go and have\
  \ a cup of tea with him afterwards.\nAs I write, the top bid is \xA350, a paltry\
  \ sum when you consider the prize on offer. And do remember that every penny raised\
  \ goes straight into the pockets of ResonanceFM, from where it will be disbursed\
  \ in manifold ways to ensure the continued existence, and improvement, of the world's\
  \ finest radio station.\nThere are many other items still to bid for, so do please\
  \ check on all of them here.\n[2015-02-17]"
