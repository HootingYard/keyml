text: "I have decided that K, in our alphabetic schedule, stands for Knowledge. More\
  \ specifically, this postage is about the status of Knowledge, how we know what\
  \ we know, and how we can \u201Cknow\u201D things which we know are untrue. Actually,\
  \ the real reason K stands for Knowledge is simply that I wanted to advert to this\
  \ splendid postage by backwatersman. Having read just the title, and been astounded,\
  \ I now \u201Cknow\u201D that\u2026\nThe last words of the Emperor Napoleon were\
  \ \u201Cweasel trappers may be lurking in your area\u201D.\nAlas and alack! I then\
  \ continued to read the full postage, and though I was mightily entertained\u2014\
  and learned a thing or two\u2014I was shattered to discover that these were not\
  \ Napoleon's last words, nor had anybody ever claimed them to be. But to look on\
  \ the bright side, there is a part of my brain that will always have the comfort\
  \ of once, very briefly, on this day, having \u201Cknown\u201D that they were.\n\
  I am happy to admit that this was a pretty desperate attempt to shoehorn an otherwise\
  \ K-free postage into my scheme. I could have waited for M for Misreading, or N\
  \ for Napoleon, or even W for Weasel, but I was impatient. You will thank me for\
  \ it one day.\n[2010-09-23]"
