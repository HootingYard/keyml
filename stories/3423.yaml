text: "Hooting Yard's anagrammatist-in-chief, R., has alerted me to Joel Stickley's\
  \ How To Write Badly Well blog. A cursory examination suggests I can pick up some\
  \ very useful tips there. This, for example, entitled \u201CPresent your research\
  \ in the form of dialogue\u201D, is brilliant:\n\u2018My god,\u2019 said Geoff,\
  \ \u2018so it's true. We hold in our very hands the original draft of the hitherto\
  \ unknown third treaty of the 1648 Peace of Westphalia signed by the Holy Roman\
  \ Emperor Ferdinand III himself.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 confirmed Sally. \u2018\
  Who would have thought when we set off this morning for this remote Swiss village\
  \ that we would end the day in possession of the very document which marked the\
  \ birth of modern European statehood?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not me!\u2019 laughed\
  \ Geoff.\n'Nor me!\u2019 guffawed Sally.\n\u2018And to think,\u2019 Geoff extemporised,\
  \ \u2018the Ratification of the Treaty of M\xFCnster occurred exactly three hundred\
  \ and sixty-one years ago today!\u2019\nMister Dan the Da Vinci Code Man has clearly\
  \ been keeping a gimlet eye on this blog, or I'm a Huguenot. There is much else\
  \ there to split your sides to, so go and visit. It may keep you all occupied while\
  \ I am away. Yes, Mr Key, the so-called \u201CDiogenesian recluse\u201D (\xA9 Chris\
  \ Cutler) will shortly be venturing abroad for a spell, during which postages here\
  \ will be sparse. More details later, when I have packed my rucksack haversack knapsack\
  \ pippy bag\u2026\n[2009-11-11]"
