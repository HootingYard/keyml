text: "Having crossed Sawdust Bridge, follow Black Pudding Basin Lane until it peters\
  \ out into a dirt track. Carry on past the clump of aspens and the inevitable cows,\
  \ and as the land suddenly slopes down towards the sea, veer slightly to the right.\
  \ If there is no mist, you may be able to see the crag. But there is usually a\_\
  \ mist. When you get to the crag, clamber up to the top of it. This is where the\
  \ king sat, either looking out to sea, or looking back at his kingdom, from its\
  \ edge. It hardly mattered in which direction he looked, for the mist was usually\
  \ so thick that he could hardly see beyond his nose, when he sat on the crag.\n\u201C\
  Where is the king?\u201D the chamberlain used to cry, sweeping from room to room\
  \ through the palace, terrifying his underlings.\n\u201CThe king is on his crag,\u201D\
  \ one would eventually reply.\nThe chamberlain cursed and kicked things and threw\
  \ pebbles at furniture, and then he sent a page to cajole the king down from the\
  \ crag. There were one or two pages who had dazzling persuasive skills. One, it\
  \ was said, could coax a leech off a leg as easily as he might puff draff from a\
  \ sill. But the king could cling to his crag with the strength of twenty kings.\
  \ In the mist, it was easy enough for a page to lose his footing and to topple into\
  \ the sea. Often, within the boom and seethe of waves upon the rocks might be heard\
  \ the thud and splash of a fallen page.\nThe chamberlain employed a gang to mop\
  \ blood from the rocks. The sea would have washed the gore away in time, but the\
  \ chamberlain was a pernickety and efficient man. That was why he had been chosen.\n\
  Sometimes a mopman might be promoted to page. Oo-er, you can see what's coming!\
  \ And so, of course, did the mopman-turned-page. \u201CI, who have mopped the blood\
  \ of pages from the rocks, will soon enough have my own blood mopped from the rocks,\u201D\
  \ wrote one, the day before the chamberlain sent him to persuade the king to leave\
  \ his crag and return to the palace and reign.\nThe king, though, reigned from his\
  \ crag, engulfed in sea mist, as gulls shrieked.\n[2009-08-02]"
