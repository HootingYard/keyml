text: "Flipping Heck is a small village equidistant between Pointy Town and its twin\
  \ town, Pointytwin Town. Pointy Town is pointier, oh so much pointier, than Pointytwin\
  \ Town, which is itself pointier than most comparable towns, and certainly oodles\
  \ more pointy than Flipping Heck, which is not pointy at all.\nThe pointiness of\
  \ Pointy Town and, to a lesser yet significant extent, of Pointytwin Town, are topics\
  \ often remarked upon in the tavern at Flipping Heck. In fact, the Flipping Heck\
  \ taverneers rarely talk of anything else, unless it be their gutters and drains\
  \ and sewers and subterranean catacombs and ossuaries and tunnels, when, that is,\
  \ they talk of anything at all, for much of the time in the tavern they do not speak\
  \ at all, but cup their tankards in their big hairy villagers\u2019 hands, gazing\
  \ morosely into the fug.\nWithin the tavern the fug is thick, but it is even thicker\
  \ outside. It is very difficult to see where you are going in Flipping Heck. Quite\
  \ apart from the thick fug, there are no signposts, nor do the lanes have names,\
  \ and nor do the hovels have numbers. There is a postman, but his comings and goings\
  \ are shrouded in mystery, and nobody will swear on a bible that they have ever\
  \ seen him.\nThere is one bible in Flipping Heck, and it is kept chained to a lectern\
  \ in the village church, St Bibblybibdib's. The vicar is from overseas, far far\
  \ away overseas, and speaks in his own strange guttural tongue, or rather shouts,\
  \ oh how he shouts, his Sunday morning sermons can be heard for miles around. It\
  \ is said you can just about hear them from the western outskirts of Pointy Town\
  \ and the eastern outskirts of Pointytwin Town, if the air is still and you prick\
  \ up your ears.\nThe air, though, is rarely still, for tremendous and terrifying\
  \ winds howl across the flat expanse of marshland between Pointy Town and Flipping\
  \ Heck and between Flipping Heck and Pointytwin Town. It is the sort of marshland\
  \ in which a fertile imagination will summon into being sprites and ghouls and,\
  \ occasionally, escaped convicts It is said that the lumbering walrus-moustached\
  \ psychopath Babinsky lurks somewhere in the marshes, sharpening his axe and biding\
  \ his time until one night he will lumber into Flipping Heck and slaughter the first-born.\
  \ It is the thought of such a calamity that hangs in the air unspoken in the village\
  \ tavern along with the fug.\nThe now dead vicar who preceded the present incumbent\
  \ of St Bibblybibdib's led a campaign to make Flipping Heck more pointy, if not\
  \ quite as pointy as Pointytwin Town, certainly far less pointy than Pointy Town,\
  \ but pointy nevertheless. There is very little evidence of his efforts, save for\
  \ his tombstone in St Bibblybibdib's churchyard, which is a little bit pointy when\
  \ viewed from a certain angle in a certain light during certain phases of the moon.\n\
  The moon is a silver disc in the sky. Such is the fug in Flipping Heck it is barely\
  \ visible to the villagers, merely a blur of milky light far, far above their heads.\
  \ But they rarely look up. Their thoughts, such as they are, are directed down,\
  \ to their gutters and drains and sewers and subterranean catacombs and ossuaries\
  \ and tunnels. Once it was possible to reach both Pointy Town and Pointytwin Town\
  \ through the tunnels, but for more than a century now they have been blocked. Rumour\
  \ has it that, when he is not lurking in the marshes, Babinsky prowls the tunnels,\
  \ dragging his blood-drenched axe behind him, singing his horrible song.\n[2016-02-15]"
