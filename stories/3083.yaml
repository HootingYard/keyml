text: "I keep trying to warn you. Over and over again I tell you to beware of the\
  \ eerie marshes, to shun them, for you know not what spooky horrors lie in wait\
  \ for you there, but you scoff, you say \u201CPshaw!, Mr Key, you and your blather\
  \ about the marshes!\u201D, and you mince off in your wellington boots, as only\
  \ you could mince in wellingtons, off towards the eerie marshes at dusk, without\
  \ a care, puffing on your expensive herbal cigarette, no map, no sou'wester, not\
  \ even a lantern, you ignore my beseeching to at least take a hound with you, a\
  \ hound with sharp fangs and brutish musculature, for protection, but no, you think\
  \ me an oaf and an idiot, and I watch as you vanish into the distance, swallowed\
  \ by the mist that hangs in the air and grows thicker and thicker the closer you\
  \ get to the eerie marshes, until, suddenly, it clears, and you stop, and stagger,\
  \ and feel a pang of ice creep down your spine, for there hovering above the eerie\
  \ marshes is an eerie phantom, inexplicably menacing, and in the voice of death\
  \ it intones verses 16 and 17 from chapter 36 of the Book of Isaiah, to wit, \u201C\
  Drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away\u201D\
  , and you realise with horror that just before you put on your wellington boots\
  \ that is precisely what you were doing, drinking the waters of your own cistern,\
  \ though I implored you not to, I fell to my knees and begged you not to drink those\
  \ waters, and you sneered at me, and gulped them down, from your cistern, and now\
  \ the wraith of the marshes has come to take you away, just as I told you it would,\
  \ and you can struggle and scream and vomit up the waters of your cistern, but it\
  \ will avail you not, you will be taken away, away, away, leaving only those empty\
  \ abandoned boots at the edge of the marshes, that none shall ever dare go and fetch,\
  \ and they will rot slowly in the mist, and all trace of you will be gone.\n\nI\
  \ am indebted to Agence Eureka for this hyperrealist illustration of the eerie marshes.\n\
