text: "A couple of weeks ago, I was delighted to learn the word perpilocutionist,\
  \ defined as \u201Cone who expounds on a subject of which he has little knowledge\u201D\
  . Aha!, I thought, with the gleam of recognition, that's me! Long ago, I jettisoned\
  \ that dull-witted advice to \u201Cwrite what you know about\u201D and took it upon\
  \ myself to write about absolutely anything that occurred to me, including that\
  \ of which I was profoundly ignorant\u2014ornithology, for example. The American\
  \ economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell has written that \u201Cit is doubtful\
  \ whether the most knowledgeable person on earth has even one percent of the total\
  \ knowledge on earth\u201D, and, if that is indeed the case, I would be hobbling\
  \ myself horribly before even putting pen to paper, were I to confine myself to\
  \ my own paltry pocketful of knowledge.\nMy delight at the discovery of the word\
  \ was somewhat tempered when I failed to track it beyond a few websites. There is\
  \ no place for it, I am sad to say, in the OED, which makes me immediately suspicious.\
  \ At first glance it seems to have a respectable Latin provenance, given its figurative\
  \ meaning as \u201Cone who talks through his hat\u201D. But while the \u201Cper\u201D\
  \ (for \u201Cthrough\u201D) and the \u201Clocution\u201D are clear enough, the Latin\
  \ \u201Cpil\u201D refers to hair rather than hats, as in words such as depilation\
  \ and caterpillar. Still, I suppose the idea of talking through a full head of hair\
  \ is akin to talking through a hat, if we picture such a pose in our mind's eye,\
  \ and the word is far too useful to discard now, simply on the basis that some wag\
  \ might have made it up. After all, I have been known to invent words from time\
  \ to time, and I don't always bother to define them.\nIdentifying myself as a perpilocutionist\
  \ grants me a magnificent opportunity, of course. Although I have been blathering\
  \ on for years about things I know little or nothing about, I have done so circumstantially,\
  \ or accidentally, or unwittingly, as it were\u2014that is, in the absence of a\
  \ conscious, declared aim or intention. But what would happen if I devised a project\
  \ to address at least a percentage of the ninety-nine-point-nine percent of knowledge\
  \ of which I am ignorant?\nTake, as an example, Madagascar. I know that it is a\
  \ big island off the western coast of Africa. I know, because once I looked it up\
  \ in a reference book for reasons I have forgotten, that the capital is Antananarivo.\
  \ (How excited I was, the other day, to shout the word at the television screen\
  \ while watching an episode of University Challenge when Jeremy Paxman sought just\
  \ that answer from the octet of not-so-tinies!) I know, or at least I think I know,\
  \ that Heinrich Himmler once suggested Madagascar as a land of settlement for the\
  \ Jews of Europe. Other than that, I would be hard-pressed to tell you a single\
  \ thing about the place. Does that mean I am incapable of writing an essay entitled\
  \ \u201COn Madagascar\u201D? Hell, no! As a perpilocutionist, I am in a perfect\
  \ position to cobble together a thousand words on the subject, on any subject. And\
  \ it is important to note that I need not precede my frantic tippy-tapping at the\
  \ keyboard with any research whatsoever, particularly that pathetic excuse for \u201C\
  research\u201D that consists, in these benighted times, of a quick browse of the\
  \ Wikipedia. No, the Madagascar of my putative essay would be the Madagascar nestled\
  \ in my ignorant head, brought forth, miraculously, through the spouting of blather.\n\
  It is no doubt foolhardy, but I have conceived the idea of writing, here, a daily\
  \ essay, of which this is the first. The likelihood is that, long before reaching\
  \ number 366 (this being a leap year) I will jack it in, abandon it, slap my forehead\
  \ in astonishment at my own witlessness. But today, at least, it is a plan, and\
  \ we shall see how it progresses. I am going to need 365 further topics, so if any\
  \ of you would like to suggest subjects I ought to address, please use the Comments\
  \ to do so. Please note that each essay's title will begin with the word \u201C\
  On\u201D.\n[2012-01-01]"
