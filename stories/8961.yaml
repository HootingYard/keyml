text: "Q\u2014What is your claim to fame?\nA\u2014My claim to fame, though modest,\
  \ is one of which I am tremendously proud, and which I never tire of shouting from\
  \ the rooftops, with the aid of a Tannoy. I cocked a snook at Pook Tuncks.\nQ\u2014\
  That is flabbergasting. Tell us more.\nA\u2014Gladly. One springtime day I was bustling\
  \ along the boulevard, bustle bustle, when across the way I spotted Pook Tuncks.\
  \ He was standing, stock still, in the lee of a linden tree, lost, I thought, in\
  \ thought. I hailed him. \u201CAhoy there! Pook Tuncks!\u201D I boomed, \u201CThou\
  \ Jesuitical duck-mesmerising versifier!\u201D And I cocked a snook at him, and\
  \ bustled on along the boulevard without waiting for a reply. When cocking a snook,\
  \ one does not entertain a response, or the point is lost.\nQ\u2014What happened\
  \ next?\nA\u2014My bustling continued until I arrived at a snackbar. It was called\
  \ Big Pingu Snackbar and was situated at the intersection of the boulevard and Erebus\
  \ And Terror Street. It is no longer there. The property is now I think a palazzo\
  \ di tat. This then extant snackbar I entered, and strutted to the counter, where\
  \ I ordered a snack before sitting down at a table by the window where I had a good\
  \ view of the boulevard. I had bustled too far along from Pook Tuncks and the linden\
  \ tree for either to be visible, though other linden trees I could see.\nQ\u2014\
  What form of snack did you order?\nA\u2014A pickle-packed sandwich and a beaker\
  \ of milk. Service at the snackbar was woeful, which is perhaps one reason why it\
  \ closed down. I had to wait a long time, sitting looking out of the window, before\
  \ a grim-faced bepimpled sallow stooped skivvy brought my snack to the table. No\
  \ napkin was provided, so there was an altercation. I insist on several napkins\
  \ in snackbars, one for my lap, one on which to wipe my hands, one with which to\
  \ dab my lips, one to mop up any spillages I might cause during my snacking, and\
  \ one for later use, which I pop into my pocket. But I was given no napkin at all,\
  \ until I made loud complaint. The loudness was unassisted, in that I did not have\
  \ recourse to the Tannoy I use nowadays to bruit my claim to fame abroad. My voice\
  \ can be loud enough in the confined space of a snackbar, and the Big Pingu Snackbar,\
  \ despite its name, was not a big snackbar. The skivvy was at first unwilling to\
  \ bring me a napkin, which I thought odd. Surely, I thundered, the napkin is an\
  \ essential component of any snackbar's toolkit? My use of the word \u201Ctoolkit\u201D\
  \ as it is deployed by management consultants and pointyheads bewildered the skivvy,\
  \ or at least she pretended bewilderment. It was hard to tell. In my experience\
  \ snackbar skivvies can be past masters at dissembling. My insistence and loudness\
  \ and eye-popping frenzy did persuade this one to fetch my napkin, but she brought\
  \ just one. I lowered my voice, just a tad, and explained that I required several\
  \ napkins, though I did not itemise the uses to which I would put them, as I have\
  \ done for you. It was not, in my view, any business of the skivvy's. I was patronising\
  \ the snackbar and I wanted my napkins, it was really as simple as that.\nQ\u2014\
  This is all very interesting, but what of Pook Tuncks? Did he detach himself from\
  \ the lee of the linden tree and pursue you into the snackbar?\nA\u2014I have yet\
  \ to conclude the anecdote of the napkins.\nQ\u2014Well, let us pass on that. I\
  \ think the listeners are agog re Pook Tuncks.\nA\u2014It is, I promise you, an\
  \ anecdote both instructive and amusing and well worth the hearing.\nQ\u2014Be that\
  \ as it may, this programme is called \u201CMy Claim To Fame\u201D, not \u201CNapkin\
  \ World\u201D or \u201CAnnals Of The Snackbars\u201D, and your claim to fame is\
  \ that you cocked a snook at Pook Tuncks, so perhaps we could concentrate on that.\n\
  A\u2014I would not want it to be thought I am some kind of napkin monomaniac, so,\
  \ reluctantly, I will desist. But I must ask, do those napkin and snackbar shows\
  \ exist, or did you just make them up for the purposes of your argument?\nQ\u2014\
  I am merely the host and presenter and, if you like, anchor of \u201CMy Claim To\
  \ Fame\u201D, so I am not familiar with the full schedule of programmes. I cannot\
  \ say for certain whether those I adverted to exist or not.\nA\u2014Could you find\
  \ out, while I sit here twiddling my thumbs?\nQ\u2014Now is not the best time. Perhaps\
  \ at the end of the show you and I could go together to see the programme director,\
  \ within whose head is gathered such a body of knowledge of the schedules that it\
  \ would dazzle you.\nA\u2014That sounds like a capital idea.\nQ\u2014So, Pook Tuncks\u2026\
  \nA\u2014And if there is not currently a snackbar and napkin strand, then I would\
  \ be happy to present such a programme, daily, at breakfast time, or even before\
  \ breakfast, at dawn, or before dawn, in the middle of the night.\nQ\u2014I am sure\
  \ the programme director would be only too willing to discuss that with you.\nA\u2014\
  Good, that is settled then.\nQ\u2014Then let us proceed. Did Pook Tuncks come crashing\
  \ into the snackbar, hot on your heels, to berate you for cocking a snook at him?\n\
  A\u2014No, he did not. I never saw hide nor hair of him again, ever after. I like\
  \ to think my cocking a snook at him must have given him pause, and caused him to\
  \ retreat, away from the boulevard and the lee of the linden tree, into reclusion\
  \ and solitude and the bleak existence of a hermit, shuttered in a hut on a remote\
  \ promontory far from humankind. Such is the power of my snook, when cocked.\nQ\u2014\
  Gosh.\n[Tinkly, hesitant, music, followed by the weather forecast.]\n[2012-04-21]"
