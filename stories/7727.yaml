text: "Today is, apparently, \u201Cthe start of a two-week frenzy of online shopping\u201D\
  . I am told by persons who know such things that it is much easier to make purchases\
  \ online than it was for Richard Bradley in the late 18th century trying to buy\
  \ an island and having to negotiate with the Tobabmanser of Jancacunda and his singing\
  \ man. Though in general I disapprove of shopping frenzies, I do think it would\
  \ be a good idea for you all to go here and buy copies of all six Hooting Yard books,\
  \ available in both paperback and ebook formats. They do, after all, make the perfect\
  \ Christmas gifts for your loved ones.\n[2011-11-28]"
