text: "There was once a woodcutter who had a burning sense of injustice. He dwelt\
  \ in a cottage deep in the forest, where there was plenty of wood for him to cut.\
  \ A day's walk to the west was the cottage of a charcoal burner, and a day's walk\
  \ to the east was the hovel of a drink-soaked ex-Trotskyist popinjay. These were\
  \ the woodcutter's neighbours, and they worried about his burning sense of injustice\
  \ and sought what they could do to alleviate it, but the woodcutter was a very taciturn\
  \ woodcutter and he never answered either the charcoal burner or the popinjay when\
  \ they asked him to explain, as they did on Thursdays when their separate foresty\
  \ routines took them both past the woodcutter's cottage where they dropped in in\
  \ the hope of being offered a mug of piping hot cocoa. Sometimes they dropped in\
  \ at the same time, so it could be a cosy threesome huddled in the unrelenting gloom\
  \ of the woodcutter's cottage.\nOn one such Thursday, the woodcutter was as reluctant\
  \ to speak as ever, but he happily poured out cocoa for his neighbours. The charcoal\
  \ burner had brought some charcoal to burn to keep him occupied, and the popinjay\
  \ was reminiscing about his Trotskyist days when he spent much of his time standing\
  \ at the entrances to railway stations handing out pamphlets to passers-by. The\
  \ woodcutter neither watched the charcoal being burned nor listened to the slurred\
  \ anecdotage of the popinjay. He sat in his chair glowering at the embers in the\
  \ fireplace, nurturing his burning sense of injustice.\nNow, the charcoal burner\
  \ and the popinjay had hatched what they thought was a very clever plan to get the\
  \ woodcutter to spill the beans. They reasoned that if they each claimed to have\
  \ a burning sense of something, and babbled on about it in confessional mode to\
  \ the woodcutter, he might well tell them of the injustice gnawing at his soul.\
  \ So the charcoal burner pretended to have a burning sense of righteousness, and\
  \ the popinjay assumed a burning sense of indigestion. They were waiting in the\
  \ gloom for an opportune moment to launch into an account of their counterfeit burning\
  \ woes.\nThis clever plan was not the only thing that was hatched on that Thursday.\
  \ In the cellar of the woodcutter's cottage, in a crate packed with straw, there\
  \ nestled a clutch of eggs that, as the charcoal burner burned charcoal and the\
  \ popinjay wittered, began to crack. The beings inside the eggs were grown too large\
  \ to be confined any longer. They were ready to be born. And what beings they were!\
  \ Startling forest creatures, crinkly and crumpled and covered in hoar-frost. Tiny\
  \ now, when full grown they would be as tall as the trees and as broad as a barn.\
  \ Their fur was matted, and the feathers that sprouted from their foreheads were\
  \ of colours beyond the known spectrum. Their many bulbous eyes, unlidded, stared\
  \ from quivering stalks with a look of tragic reproach, the tears that dripped from\
  \ them sulphurous and boiling hot. They had collapsible lungs and sharp fangs and\
  \ great thumping hooves and a milky pallor and beaks and ears and elbows and pot\
  \ bellies. When they crawled upon the earth, they turned the soil to muck teeming\
  \ with maggots, and when they reared up on their hind legs and roared, they blotted\
  \ out the sun. They had enormous brains, and enormous shovel-like paws, and enormous\
  \ ill-will. They fed on everything, living and dead, and vomited most of it up again,\
  \ making disgusting, deafening noises. Their antennae picked up signals from outer\
  \ space, their inability to understand which caused them such fury that they ripped\
  \ and tore and savaged whatever was in front of them with their long pointy claws.\
  \ When they were not roaring they made a tremendous buzzing sound, and when neither\
  \ roaring nor buzzing they howled and whimpered. A continuous stream of steam and\
  \ smoke poured out of each of their numberless orifices, poisoning the air around\
  \ them. They were hunchbacked. They moved with inhuman speed. They left a trail\
  \ of filth and pus in their wake. They stank of beer and gin and sweat and death.\
  \ Nobody, not even the weird mad people who dwelt in the weirdest, deepest parts\
  \ of the forest, kept them as pets, or wove pretty wicker baskets for them to doze\
  \ in, or cosseted them, or loved them.\nIn his pamphlet on the forest beings, which\
  \ is out of print, Dobson described them differently. But he had never seen one,\
  \ and he was working from unreliable sources. Indeed, he did not know they were\
  \ hatched from eggs, believing instead the mediaeval superstition that they were\
  \ formed from the breath of seagulls blown upon the excrement of ladybirds. Where\
  \ such a fancy originated is unknown.\nThe sound of the eggs cracking open was loud\
  \ enough to be heard in the room above the cellar, and both the charcoal burner\
  \ and the drink-soaked ex-Trotskyist popinjay cocked their ears and gave quizzical\
  \ looks, first at each other and then at the woodcutter. The woodcutter remained\
  \ as taciturn as ever, slumped in his chair, taking great gulps from his mug of\
  \ cocoa. He had sprayed himself, that morning, with half a canister's worth of Hengist,\
  \ \u201Cthe scent for men of the forest\u201D, and there was an aura of indestructibility\
  \ about him, as well as a burning sense of injustice.\nIt was that sense of injustice\
  \ which had led the woodcutter to steal the eggs from the nest of a forest being\
  \ matriarch. His mind had gone loopy long ago, and he thought that he would be able\
  \ to train newborn forest beings, put them on leashes, and have them do his bidding.\
  \ First he would whet their appetites by letting them rend and slash and gobble\
  \ up the charcoal burner and the popinjay, and then he would set out with them on\
  \ a long, long journey, tracking down Benny and Bjorn and Agnetha and Anna-Frid,\
  \ one by one, and wreak vengeance upon them for having, so many years ago, sacked\
  \ him from their pop group on the day they signed their first recording contract.\n\
  He had reckoned without the matriarch, of course. She, too, heard the cracking of\
  \ her eggs, and now she loomed huge and hideous over the woodcutter's cottage, deep\
  \ in the forest, where no one with any sense would ever dwell, for it is a weird\
  \ and eerie place and it is teeming with monsters.\n[2008-12-18]"
