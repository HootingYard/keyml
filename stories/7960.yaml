text: "Astute readers, with their wits about them, will have noticed that the Hooting\
  \ Yard Boxing Day Project failed to appear yesterday. I do apologise. What wit one\
  \ thing and anutter, as my Belgian mother used to say, I simply didn't get round\
  \ to it. Still, the Yuletide season would be a puny and curdled affair without a\
  \ Hooting Yard project to keep you occupied, so\u2014better late than never\u2014\
  here it is.\nYou will now have your complete Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, a large\
  \ sheet of cardboard to which you have pasted, with glue, pictures of a drainage\
  \ ditch and a wooden bobsleigh and cows struck by lightning and a blanket bog and\
  \ a bat god and painted wooden decoy buffleheads and celery compound and the Hobbs\
  \ End tube station demon from Quatermass And The Pit and a bowl of pap \u2018n\u2019\
  \ slops and pigs in a pig sty and Our Lady Of The Arctic Wastes and Aguirre, The\
  \ Wrath Of God with a Capuchin monkey and a postage stamp depicting a trio of ne'er-do-wells\
  \ with whisks and celery and Little Severin The Mystic Badger and undersea adventurers\
  \ pursued by giant jellyfish and a Norbiton allotment shed and imaginary history\
  \ in the London Library and crackpots brandishing placards and a graveyard of ships\
  \ from The Lost Continent and Plovdiv and ectoplasm and a mandrake-root homunculus\
  \ and statuettes of saints and martyrs and bishops and BVMs and cardboard signage\
  \ and Jesus directing traffic.\nGo and get a second sheet of cardboard of roughly\
  \ the same size and, using a pair of sharp scissors, cut it into twenty-five rectangular\
  \ bits. If you are doing things properly, you should find yourself with twenty-five\
  \ bits of cardboard each of which is a little bigger than its corresponding picture\
  \ pasted to the original sheet of cardboard.\nThe next step is to place the bits\
  \ of cardboard over the pictures, thus blocking them from sight. You can now fix\
  \ the bits of cardboard in place by sticking a length of sticky tape\u2014cut from\
  \ a roll using the sharp pair of scissors\u2014along the top edge of each rectangle,\
  \ so that you create a set of twenty-five cardboard flaps on the original sheet\
  \ of cardboard. With a thick black marker pen, randomly number the flaps from one\
  \ to twenty-five, using Roman numerals. Then shove the beflapped sheet of cardboard\
  \ into a cubby or cupboard or indoor storage facility and forget about it.\nAnd\
  \ lo! When the first of December 2012 rolls around, eleven months hence, you can\
  \ retrieve it from its hidey-hole and prop it up on your mantelpiece, if you have\
  \ a mantelpiece, and then, day by day, from the first of December until Christmas\
  \ Day, tear the appropriately numbered cardboard flap off the main sheet, carefully\
  \ disposing of it in a wastepaper bin. Each day, therefore, you will reveal one\
  \ of the pictures which, by this time next year, you will have completely forgotten\
  \ about.\nAnd thus, through craft and cleverness, you are already in possession\
  \ of your Hooting Yard Advent Calendar for 2012!\n[2011-12-27]"
