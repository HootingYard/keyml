text: 'When the usual suspects publish their books, they can be guaranteed to pat
  each other on the back in the pages of their North London Literary Mafia house journals.
  When a starving scrivener such as Mr Key publishes his books, he does so to resounding
  indifference from those same publications. This is neither surprising nor particularly
  exasperating (on a good day), but it is a lamentable state of affairs. In the past,
  some review copies have been sent out, but they may as well have been chewed up
  by a post office hound.

  It occurs to me that Hooting Yard readers might wish to marshal the power of the
  interweb and write their own reviews, to be posted on their own blogs, if they have
  such things, or on a dedicated page here. This would give new visitors some idea
  of what delights await them, and also be a generally cockle-warming exercise for
  all concerned. Just a (possibly ill-advised) thought, in a moment of grumpiness.
