text: "One of the most valuable lessons life has taught me is to know the difference\
  \ between salvation and salivation. It is so easy to confuse the two, especially\
  \ in one's youth. When I was a young whippersnappernipper, long ago, I would regularly\
  \ insert an i when one was not needed, or omit an i where the high heavens cried\
  \ out for one. I know I was not the only pimply young shaver to commit these errors.\
  \ Over the decades, I have had conversations with, ooh, hundreds if not thousands\
  \ of people who were\u2014and in some cases still are!\u2014fuddled by the difference.\
  \ It should go without saying that confusing the two can have serious ramifications.\n\
  That is another word, incidentally, with which I had problems. I would commonly\
  \ omit not just an i but also an a, giving it as ramfictions. This was because I\
  \ thought it had something to do with stories about sheep. My dear departed Ma would\
  \ regularly read to me a bedtime story about a sheep named Dolores, whose fleece\
  \ became snagged on a wire fence at the edge of a field on a farm in a fictional\
  \ place called Dippydopeyland. As her name indicates, Dolores was a ewe rather than\
  \ a ram, so even if such a thing as a ramfiction existed, which it did not, except\
  \ within my little head, her story would not have been one. But that was just something\
  \ else that confused me as a child.\nWhen I heard the word ewe I thought the speaker\
  \ was referring to a yew. I suspect this was because, when it was my dear departed\
  \ Pa's turn to read me a bedtime story, he invariably chose to recite, in an eerie\
  \ voice, \u201CThe Moon And The Yew Tree\u201D by Sylvia Plath. The result was that\
  \ I found Ma's story of Dolores frankly incomprehensible. The Plath poem, on the\
  \ other hand, with its fumy spiritous mists and sea like a dark crime and bonging\
  \ bells and bats and owls and the moon bald and wild and the blackness and silence,\
  \ I found almost unbearably thrilling, so much so that I began to salivate. I would\
  \ often slobber on to my pillow before Pa got to the end of the poem.\nOf course,\
  \ I confused my salivation with salvation, and imagined Jesus was about to come\
  \ and pluck me from my bed, and take me to his bosom, and up to heaven, where he\
  \ wanted me for a sunbeam. Now, as it happened, if Ma and Pa were called away to\
  \ a night rally, my dear departed Uncle Ned read my bedtime story, which for him\
  \ was always Chapter V of Part III of Travels into Several Remote Nations of the\
  \ World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain\
  \ of Several Ships. That is why, throughout my childhood, I was convinced I was\
  \ a cucumber.\n[2018-02-06]"
