text: "\nPicture yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and marmalade\
  \ skies. You are wearing a pair of round gold-rimmed \u201Cgranny\u201D glasses.\
  \ Beside you in the boat is your wife, an avant-garde artist from faraway Japan.\
  \ You turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream. Then you turn your mind back\
  \ on, just a tad, just enough to imagine no possessions. You wonder if now would\
  \ be an opportune moment to raise with your wife that malarkey about her acquiring\
  \ a second apartment solely for the storage of her collection of fur coats. You\
  \ open your mouth to speak, but what comes out is gibberish. \u201CGoo-goo-g'joob\u201D\
  , you blurt. Your wife looks at you as if you have taken leave of your senses, which,\
  \ to be frank, you probably have. Perhaps Bernard Levin was right when he wrote\
  \ that there was nothing wrong with you that could not be cured by standing you\
  \ upside down and shaking you gently until whatever is inside your head falls out.\n\
  It strikes you that such a manoeuvre would be perilous if performed in a boat on\
  \ a river. Your wife, who would have to turn you upside down, is diminutive, and\
  \ it is likely that if she made the attempt both of you would topple over, capsizing\
  \ the boat, and forcing you to swim to the riverbank.\nThere are, apparently, tales\
  \ of the riverbank, but you did not write them. Nor did you write tales of topographic\
  \ oceans. But you did write about that famed ocean-going sailor Sir Walter Raleigh,\
  \ who you described as a stupid git. You pronounced Raleigh as Rally. Nowadays,\
  \ people usually pronounce it as Rahley. But in his own time his name was universally\
  \ pronounced Rawley.\nThe pronunciation of surnames is important. I have heard tell\
  \ that an alarming number of young persons confuse you with the Bolshevik psychopath\
  \ Lenin. These are presumably the same young persons who confuse Clarice Starling,\
  \ the FBI agent played by Jodie Foster in The Silence Of The Lambs, with your successor\
  \ Stalin.\nOops! I meant Lenin's successor, not yours. Now I'm getting things all\
  \ mixed up in my head. Just like you. Well, you wrote a lot of nonsense too.\n[2017-09-27]"
