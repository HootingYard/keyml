text: 'Some Gerard Manley Hopkins for Easter. Here is the final stanza of The Wreck
  Of The Deutschland:

  Dame, at our door

  Drowned, and among our shoals,

  Remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the Reward:

  Our King back, oh, upon English souls!

  Let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us, be a crimson-cresseted
  east,

  More brightening her, rare-dear Britain, as his reign rolls,

  Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest,

  Our hearts'' charity''s hearth''s fire, our thoughts'' chivalry''s throng''s Lord.
