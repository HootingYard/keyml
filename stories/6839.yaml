  \ wait a minute! How likely is it that our lives could ever depend upon a stubbing,\
  \ or stubbings, of a toe, or toes? There is, I suppose, the possibility that we\
  \ might be arraigned before a firing squad, blindfolded, wearing a white shirt,\
  \ its top buttons undone, hands bound behind our back, jaw jutting in revolutionary\
  \ or irredentist defiance, and at the moment when the moustachioed Capitan is about\
  \ to give the order to fire, he stubs his toe, and instead shouts \u201COuch!\u201D\
  , and the firing squad, disconcerted, lowers its rifles, thus winning us a reprieve\
  \ from death.\nI can immediately think of two problems with this scenario. First,\
  \ upon what nature of object, likely to be encountered on a ground suitable for\
  \ the assembly of a firing squad, could the Capitan stub his toe sufficient to cause\
  \ him to cry out, given that his toes would be encased in sturdy military boots?\
  \ We might posit a block of iron, inexplicably left lying around just where the\
  \ Capitan is standing, but why, at the point of issuing the order to fire, would\
  \ he think to move his foot, and even if he did, would he not notice the iron block?\
  \ All toe-stubbings are accidental, and the accident here imagined is beyond the\
  \ bounds of common sense. It is true that some men rise to the rank of Capitan though\
  \ they be fools, or wet behind the ears, or otherwise lacking in nous, but even\
  \ so\u2026\nA second objection is that, having stubbed his toe, and shouted \u201C\
  Ouch!\u201D instead of \u201CFire!\u201D, and the firing squad having been disconcerted,\
  \ the execution would be cancelled entire rather than merely postponed. Indeed,\
  \ it is probable that it would not be postponed for very long. A toe-stubbing is,\
  \ by definition, a sharp and instant trauma, and though the toe may throb for a\
  \ goodly length of time, the shock itself quickly passes, and one has one's wits\
  \ about one within seconds. Thus, having unexpectedly said \u201COuch!\u201D, the\
  \ Capitan, if he is at all worth his Capitan's salt, will brush off the accident\
  \ and proceed with his proper business, which in this circumstance is the order\
  \ to the firing squad to bring about our destruction under a volley of bullets.\n\
  A third problem has just occurred to me, which is that the firing squad, tensed\
  \ up and ready to fire, might well respond to any barked exclamation from their\
  \ Capitan, and not pause to discriminate between \u201COuch!\u201D and \u201CFire!\u201D\
  \ or indeed any other noise that issues from his mouth at that precise moment.\n\
  The general point here is that the stubbing of the Capitan's toe does not become\
  \ a matter of life and death, because however we consider the situation our death\
  \ is inevitable. Whether or not it is just, in view of our revolutionary or irredentist\
  \ credentials, need not concern us here.\nBut what about a wholly different circumstance\
  \ where, say, we are a passenger aboard a locomotive, chugging at high speed across\
  \ a high bridge, and the engine driver, in the necessarily confined space of his\
  \ engine driver's cabin, and in the course of the necessary physical manoeuvres\
  \ of his engine driver's duties, stubs his toe on the kind of hard metal panel or\
  \ protuberance inevitably present in such a cabin at the front of such a locomotive?\
  \ Now\_ I am wholly unacquainted with the ins and outs of the engine driver's art,\
  \ but it seems to me that in a situation such as the one described there is a very\
  \ real danger of the brief and temporary shock of a toe-stubbing leading to much\
  \ greater disaster. If we consider the Capitan again for a moment, we should note\
  \ that he has but the one decision to make, that of ordering the firing squad to\
  \ shoot, and is at leisure to choose the moment. He may pause to preen his epaulettes,\
  \ or to smoke a cigarette, even to offer a last cigarette to us as we await death.\
  \ But for the engine driver, in control of a huge machine rattling at high speed\
  \ across a high bridge, there is no such opportunity for relaxation. He must be\
  \ ever alert, and the momentary loss of concentration entailed by the stubbing of\
  \ his toe could well lead to him losing control of the engine and the locomotive\
  \ being derailed and plunging off the bridge to crash into the river rapids far\
  \ below, causing mayhem and destruction and, yes, death not only for himself but\
  \ for all the passengers aboard the locomotive. Even the strongest of swimmers among\
  \ us are likely to be too seriously maimed by the fall and impact to be capable\
  \ of safely reaching the riverbank, in the unlikely event that the wild currents\
  \ of the rapids did not dash us against jagged and treacherous rocks.\nIt is fair\
  \ to say, then, that there are indeed circumstances where the stubbing of a toe\
  \ can be a matter of life and death. Bear that in mind when next you prepare to\
  \ go out of your house, as you consider which socks, which boots, best meet the\
  \ possible perils of the day.\n[2011-07-05]"
