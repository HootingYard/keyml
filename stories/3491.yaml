text: 'I have packed my pippy bag and will be off on my travels first thing tomorrow
  morning. Postages at Hooting Yard will thus be sparse, or perhaps non-existent,
  for the next couple of weeks. You can stave off hysteria by rummaging in the Archives,
  or buying the books. Speaking of which, almost as soon as I return to Blighty in
  the second week of December, a brand new Hooting Yard book will be published, thus
  solving your Christmas gift problems!
