text: "I remember the Latin Mass. Dimly, dimly, but I do remember it, in all its mystery.\
  \ It was perhaps made all the more unfathomable because, until I was six or seven\
  \ years old, we attended Sunday morning Mass in a pub. Not in a function room within\
  \ a pub, but in the main bar area. Towels were draped over the beer pumps, that\
  \ I remember. These were the only visits to a pub my family made.\nThinking back,\
  \ I must have found the world a very confusing place, at least on Sunday mornings.\
  \ All smartly dressed, we would walk together to this big pub on a crossroads, wherein\
  \ a man in a black soutane would intone what must have struck me as gibberish, while\
  \ performing slow ritualistic manoeuvres, against a backdrop of a counter lined\
  \ with a row of unknown objects hidden under towels, behind which was a glittering\
  \ array of bottles and glassware. I remember that when Mass ended, many of the parishioners,\
  \ and the priest, remained behind, eager for the pub to open, but we always left\
  \ to go home.\nThere was no Catholic church on the council estate where I grew up,\
  \ and I assume the parish had persuaded the pub landlord to offer his premises to\
  \ ensure our souls were saved. In my memory, I date the change to the vernacular\
  \ Mass, and the longer walk to the parish church proper, as happening at the same\
  \ time, when I was six or seven. Thus passed forever a curious feature of my childhood.\
  \ I was old enough for it to have become a familiar, even reassuring, routine, and\
  \ I recall a vague yet definite sense of disappointment with the new regime. I didn't\
  \ mind the longer walk\u2014it took us through a park, with a playground and a duckpond\
  \ and immense green well-mown lawns\u2014but instead of the wood-panelled gloom\
  \ of the pub, Mass now took place in a bright, modern church and, worse, I could\
  \ understand the words. All the mystery was leached out of my Sunday mornings.\n\
  It took only a few years of that before, one morning when I was fourteen, I woke\
  \ up with the clear conviction that the whole Catholicism hoo-hah\u2014actually,\
  \ no, the whole religion hoo-hah\u2014was absolute twaddle. I have never seriously\
  \ diverted from this view in the succeeding years, despite a couple of wobbles.\
  \ My devout yet tolerant parents never made an issue of it, never forced me to attend\
  \ that ghastly bright modern church against my will, though I remember my father\
  \ telling me, with a strange admixture of the world-weary and the smug, that the\
  \ day would come when I would return to the bosom of the church and re-embrace the\
  \ faith of my childhood. Who knows?, he may yet be proved right.\nI find myself\
  \ wondering if my loss of faith, which really did seem to happen overnight, would\
  \ have been quite so decisive had the Mass still been said in Latin, had we still\
  \ celebrated it in the pub. There was something very seductive about those incomprehensible\
  \ words. I would happily have swapped the pub for a church that was old and stony\
  \ and cold and gloomy, but knowing the sense of what the priest was saying, and\
  \ what I was bidden to respond, was fatal.\nThe name of the pub was the Moby-Dick.\
  \ It is still there, on the crossroads. Not so long ago, I passed it, on the way\
  \ to somewhere unconnected with my childhood, and I was pleased to note\u2014for\
  \ the first time, but also for the first time consciously checking\u2014that the\
  \ hyphen in the title of the novel is present and correct in the name of the pub.\
  \ (Just as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is often given as 1984, so Moby-Dick loses\
  \ its hyphen, to my minor irritation.) When tiny, and attending Mass, I was of course\
  \ wholly ignorant of Melville's novel. It was not among the many many books on the\
  \ shelves at home\u2014a huge number of books, the possession of which I thought\
  \ was commonplace, until I grew a little older and learned that most of our neighbours\
  \ on the estate had no books at all. But I did know that Moby-Dick was a whale,\
  \ for so it was depicted, white and thrashing about in the sea, on the pub sign.\
  \ I cannot remember how old I was when I learned of the existence of the book, though\
  \ I do recall, as a teenager, buying the copy I still have, the Penguin edition\
  \ bulked out with Harold Beaver's remarkable critical apparatus. Years passed before\
  \ I actually got round to reading it, and I read more of Melville\u2014Bartleby\
  \ The Scrivener and Typee and The Confidence-Man\_: His Masquerade\u2014before I\
  \ read Moby-Dick. Which, of course, if I am to insist on the hyphen, I should also\
  \ take care to give its proper title Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. And typing that last\
  \ word reminds me, all of a sudden, that the name of the road on which the pub is\
  \ situated, one of the four meeting at the crossroads, is Whalebone Lane. I have\
  \ no idea what possible connection there is between this road, far from the sea,\
  \ and whales or whaling. No doubt I could find out.\nI do know, incidentally, that\
  \ close by, for many years, lived Eva Hart (1905\u20131996), one of the longest-living\
  \ survivors of the sinking of the Titanic. There is a local pub named after her\
  \ too.\n[2012-01-27]"
