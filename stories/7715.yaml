text: "Black is the colour of my true love's bear. It is a big, fierce, black, and\
  \ untamed bear and it lumbers about, roaring. She has confined it to her attic.\n\
  Why, I asked my true love as we canoodled on a municipal park bench, did she keep\
  \ a wild black bear in her attic?\nIt was a sorry tale she told me, of her twin\
  \ brother, of his job as a zookeeper, of the closure of the zoo, of the need to\
  \ find homes for the zoo's birds and serpents, its ants and dromedaries and gazelles,\
  \ its sharks and bears, of her twin's ursophilia and of his volunteering to take\
  \ the big fierce black untamed bear a-home with him, of how, as brother and bear\
  \ went hand-in-paw along the lane leading to his home, the bear set upon him, fierce\
  \ and furious, gouging and slashing and thumping and biting, until her twin lay\
  \ dead upon the path beside the river, of how, upon its further rampages, the bear\
  \ fetched up outside her, my true love's, house, and bashed its way through the\
  \ door, roaring, of how she coaxed it up into the attic, with a bowl of water and\
  \ dumplings, of how she slammed shut the door at the top of the stairs and blocked\
  \ it with a large mahogany sideboard, of how she sat, exhausted and weeping, in\
  \ her kitchen, until I came a-knocking at her door and invited her to join me for\
  \ a walk in the municipal park and for a canoodle on the municipal park bench.\n\
  \u201CI did not know you had a twin,\u201D I said.\n\u201CHe lies dead upon the\
  \ lane, so I have a twin no more,\u201D she said, \u201CNow I have but his bear.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhat will you do?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CShort of keeping it confined to\
  \ the attic and feeding it with dumplings and bowls of water, I have no idea,\u201D\
  \ she replied.\n\u201CI am sure you could sell it for a tidy sum to an inhumane\
  \ rascal,\u201D I said, at which my true love ceased canoodling and glared at me\
  \ and slapped my face.\n\u201CHow dare you suggest such a thing!\u201D, she cried,\
  \ impassioned, \u201CThat bear may be big and fierce and black and untamed, but\
  \ it is my last link with my dead twin, and he loved it more than life itself!\u201D\
  \nAnd she stood up and strode away across the municipal park lawn.\nThe course of\
  \ true love seldom runs smooth, but I couldn't help thinking that it damned well\
  \ ought to. Clearly I had upset Ursula more than I knew, and I would have to find\
  \ some way of making it up to her. But how? It would be pointless trying to raise\
  \ her brother from the dead, for I have had a bash at resurrection in my time and\
  \ it failed utterly. Could I reopen the zoo, and convince my true love that the\
  \ bear would be happier there, and march it back from whence it came? But then I\
  \ would presumably have to go and collect all the birds and serpents and ants and\
  \ dromedaries and gazelles and sharks too, and somehow provide for them. The more\
  \ I thought about it, the more probable it seemed that the bear was going to be\
  \ lumbering about in Ursula's attic for the foreseeable future. It would get lonely\
  \ up there. Perhaps what I needed to do was to procure another bear, from another\
  \ closing-down zoo, and take it to the attic, to be a pal. But in doing so, would\
  \ I not risk, in leading the second bear along the lane by the river towards her\
  \ house, the same fate as my true love's twin brother? I too might be gouged and\
  \ slashed and thumped and bitten and left for dead, and that would not help anybody.\n\
  I was still sitting on the municipal park bench, mulling these things over, when\
  \ I saw my true love come sprinting towards me across the lawn.\n\u201COh woe is\
  \ me!\u201D she was crying, \u201CFirst my twin brother, and now the bear!\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhat has happened, my darling dear?\u201D I asked, as she slumped on the\
  \ bench.\n\u201CI took up a bowl of water and a dumpling for it, and it choked on\
  \ the dumpling!\u201D she cried, \u201CI could not revive it try as I might.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou gave the bear the kiss of life\u201D I asked, curious.\n\u201CI tried,\
  \ yes, oh I tried!\u201D she said.\nLater that week, there was a double funeral,\
  \ for my true love's twin brother and for the bear. We buried them in the same tomb.\
  \ We mourned, we wept, we wore black, black, black.\n[2011-11-28]"
