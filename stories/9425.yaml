  Let Buz bless with the Jackall\u2014but the Lord is the Lion's provider.\n\u2013\
  \ Christopher Smart, Jubilate Agno, Fragment A.\nI wondered what ever became of\
  \ Huz and Buz, the stout companions of my childhood. On the long summer afternoons\
  \ we three played together in the shadow of the old viaduct out by Pang Hill. We\
  \ played foopball and hockey and we polevaulted over ditches and we set fire to\
  \ buttercups and we pretended to be Prussians or Russians or monsters from the far\
  \ Carpathians. And always Huz had his polypus puppet of wool and wire, and Buz his\
  \ cardboard jackal. And in the gloaming at the end of those endless days, Huz and\
  \ Buz would trot back to Pang Hill Orphanage and sneak in through the hidden wicket,\
  \ and I would trudge home, along the canal towpath rife with phlox and lupins, to\
  \ the enormous mansion where Ma and Pa lay on separate ottomans in separate chambers\
  \ in separate wings, both of them neurasthenic and medicated and moaning. I ate\
  \ my dinner with Crouch, the impossibly tall and gangling servant, in the baronial\
  \ hall, tenebrous and chill, where bats swooped in the rafters, and the rafters\
  \ rotted, and sometimes shards of rafter dropped into my soup. And I thought of\
  \ Huz and Buz, shivering in their attic room in the orphanage, going hungry to their\
  \ iron cots.\nSometimes, in the night, I would slip out of bed and pad along the\
  \ corridor to Ma's wireless room to transmit coded messages, buzzes and clicks and\
  \ bleeps, to my pals. Either Huz, or Buz, I forget which, had smuggled a portable\
  \ metal tapping machine into the orphanage and kept it hidden under the sandbag\
  \ that served as his pillow. It was a hazardous business, for there was always the\
  \ risk he might be caught by the beadle. If that happened, Huz or Buz would be made\
  \ to put a saucepan on his head and spend a week on the orphanage roof, among the\
  \ crows and ravens, without shelter, slaking his thirst with rainwater from the\
  \ gutters. It was hazardous for me too. The wireless room was thick with dust and\
  \ cobwebs, spiders and beetles and gnats. Ma had abandoned it long ago, before I\
  \ was born. Once it had been her sanctum, when she was young and lively and the\
  \ recipient of mountaineering trophies. Crouch still polished the trophies, devotedly,\
  \ day after day, with his special rags.\nThe messages we exchanged in the night\
  \ were couched in a private language Huz and Buz and I had devised. I still have\
  \ some of the transcripts, musty and dog-eared, the ink fading, in a filing cabinet\
  \ in what was once Pa's smoking room. I do not know why I keep them, for I long\
  \ ago forgot the language, and can wring no sense from them. Perhaps it is that\
  \ they are the sole remaining tangible reminders of my childhood friends. The orphanage,\
  \ at the railings of which I often stood and wept, burned down last year. The beadle's\
  \ grandson was arrested, but I do not know the outcome of the case. The local police\
  \ officers do not speak to me any more.\nAs a child, I was barely aware that the\
  \ police existed. Certainly, on those long afternoons by the old viaduct, Huz and\
  \ Buz and I never once saw a police officer. The only person we ever saw in uniform\
  \ was the tally man with his dog, on his patrols, and we would always hide from\
  \ him. We used to make up stories in which he and his dog were involved in alarming\
  \ hazchem episodes. Once I think Huz or Buz devised a plan to kidnap the dog and\
  \ take it back to Pang Hill Orphanage to attack the beadle, until I pointed out\
  \ that it was old and lame and almost blind, and could not attack one of the gnats\
  \ in the wireless room. Then one day we saw the tally man alone and dogless, and\
  \ we assumed the dog had died. We decided to make an excursion to the pet cemetery,\
  \ to leave a bunch of lupins on its grave. The pet cemetery was out beyond the orchard\
  \ and the railway tracks and the decoy airfield, but none of us was clear precisely\
  \ where it was, and we got lost. The sun was sinking in the west when we came to\
  \ an army camp. I was worried about Crouch, who would be cooking our soup and herrings\
  \ and would be wondering where I had got to. Huz and Buz were fearful of the beadle,\
  \ who would no doubt be pulling a couple of saucepans from their hooks and clearing\
  \ the staircase up to the roof. Though it was summer, there was a chill in the air\
  \ at dusk, and we shivered as we sank exhausted to the ground at the perimeter fence.\
  \ We were far from home, far from the mansion and the orphanage, and we had no idea\
  \ what to do.\nWhen the sky grew darker, searchlights flashed on, and we were caught\
  \ in the bright beam of one. A sentry spotted us, and took us into the camp. He\
  \ put us in a tent and told us to wait. We were, I think, so awestruck by his uniform,\
  \ so much more resplendent than that of the tally man, that we could hardly think.\
  \ We made no attempt to escape. About half an hour passed before a captain entered.\
  \ His uniform was even more impressive, all crimson and gold, with epaulettes and\
  \ medals, and he carried a sword. He rapped a few questions at us, which we answered\
  \ truthfully, in shaky little squeaks, for we were tired and hungry and terrified.\
  \ Then he left. Huz and Buz and I rummaged in our pockets for playthings, and improvised\
  \ a game with a button, a rubber band, and a boiled sweet wrapper.\nIt kept us occupied\
  \ until we heard the spluttering of an engine, followed by the parp of a hooter.\
  \ It was Crouch! He had been summoned to collect us. At least, that is what we thought.\
  \ When he came into the tent, accompanied by the captain, we burst into tears of\
  \ relief. For Huz and Buz, alas, the relief was short-lived. The captain announced\
  \ that Crouch had come to take me home.\n\u201CAs for you orphans,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201CWar was declared earlier today, and we need every recruit we can lay our\
  \ hands on. You will be shipped overseas at the break of dawn, to fight the good\
  \ fight.\u201D\nI clutched Crouch's hand and he led me away towards his jalopy.\
  \ As we went out through the tent flap, I looked back at Huz and Buz, my childhood\
  \ friends. I never saw them again.\n[2012-06-14]"
