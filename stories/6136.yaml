text: "For the past few days I have fallen victim to the disorder known as vacancy-between-the-ears.\
  \ Contrary to popular belief, this malady does not mean that the head is entirely\
  \ empty. There are, for example, certain fugitive thoughts that flit through, such\
  \ as \u201CI think I shall make another cup of tea\u201D or \u201CI shall pop out\
  \ to the corner shop and spend my latest Old Halob subscription\u201D. But when\
  \ vacancy-between-the-ears strikes, the victim is hard pressed to have more interesting\
  \ thoughts than these, and it is the more interesting thoughts that give rise, in\
  \ the general run of things, to Hooting Yard postages.\nSo, for example, the idea\
  \ of nipping out to buy a pouch of acrid Serbian tobacco does not lend itself to\
  \ paragraphs of tremendous prose, of which postages are wrought. It is, of course,\
  \ possible that something exciting may occur during the nipping-out, such as the\
  \ sight of a flock of bitterns, or the inadvertent stepping into a puddle, or perhaps\
  \ a religious revivalist meeting with hymns and tambourines and hellfire-and-brimstone\
  \ preaching. But one of the distressing effects of vacancy-between-the-ears is that\
  \ even diversions such as these fail to set the cranial synapses a-snapping. The\
  \ scribbler is bereft.\nIn these circumstances, the best thing to do is to embrace\
  \ the vacancy and make no effort to cram anything into it. There will be the usual\
  \ cupboard o\u2019 stuff at The Dabbler on Friday, but otherwise Mr Key has decided\
  \ to wait for ideas to plop into his head, like manna from heaven.\nBack soon.\n\
