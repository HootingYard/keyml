text: "See Thog. See Thog run. See Thog shape-shift.\nI'm sorry, I was getting Thog\
  \ mixed up with Spot. Spot we dealt with yesterday, and Thog we shall deal with\
  \ today. I can only think I got the two confused, between yesterday and today, due\
  \ to some weird rip in the space-time continuum. It is the kind of thing that happens\
  \ all too often when having to cope with such as Thog, creatures who occupy the\
  \ world we might best describe as science fiction or fantasy. Unlike Spot, who is\
  \ merely an earthy dog, Thog is a being from another dimension, or possibly several\
  \ other dimensions, most of which you cannot imagine and I would have the devil\
  \ of a job to explicate. Fortunately for me, I cannot be bothered to do so.\nMy\
  \ opening lines were doubly erroneous. Not only did I get Thog and Spot mixed up,\
  \ but I suggested that one could \u201Csee\u201D Thog. Whether this is true is very\
  \ far from clear. It may be that much of the time Thog is not actually visible to\
  \ the human eye. The same is true of Spot of course, given that he might be resting\
  \ in his kennel or hiding behind a splurge of lupins, but generally speaking dogs\
  \ are incontrovertibly visible. Not so Thog. Being a shape-shifting being from unknown\
  \ and unimaginable other dimensions, Thog is not so easy to pin down.\nHaving said\
  \ that, there is one tale\u2014it is either an Astounding Tale or a Weird Tale,\
  \ I forget which\u2014where a mad boffin devises a so-called set of \u201CThog pins\u201D\
  \ special fantasy science fiction pins expressly designed to pin Thog as one might\
  \ pin a butterfly, were one a butterfly collector. Duly pinned, Thog effects an\
  \ escape by deploying \u201CThog power\u201D. Impressive as this is, it is never\
  \ coherently defined, so one cannot emulate Thog in one's everyday life in the way\
  \ one might emulate one's other favourite fictional characters. The mad boffin,\
  \ by the way, comes to a bad end, so one would not want to emulate him, either.\n\
  Coherence is not really a quality we are looking for when reading about Thog, and\
  \ just as well. One of the best stories is also one of the least coherent. This\
  \ is Thog On The Tyne, a thrilling science fiction adventure set in Newcastle, written\
  \ entirely in Geordie dialect. For most of us, it is incomprehensible. But it has\
  \ its special pleasures, and when I have worked out what they are I will tell you.\n\
  Because Thog himself\u2014or, I suppose, itself\u2014defeats easy definition, it\
  \ is no surprise to learn that attempts to film the stories have met with consistent\
  \ failure. There was a 1967 flick in which Thog arrives, in a spacecraft, at Alexandra\
  \ Palace in London to take part in the 14-Hour Technicolour Dream. He does a variety\
  \ of fantastical Thoggish things, and at one point can be spotted just behind John\
  \ Lennon, but it is all a bit pedestrian. Of more interest, if equally unsuccessful\
  \ at the box office, was the 1970s series of Thog films directed by Lindsay Anderson.\
  \ What is noteworthy about them is that all the scenes involving Thog ended up on\
  \ the cutting room floor. Anderson himself was said to be livid, but then he was\
  \ reportedly quite a cantankerous chap at the best of times.\nUnlike Spot, Thog\
  \ has never been the protagonist of a children's television series, though one is\
  \ long overdue. A cartoon Thog might be quite a hit with the tinies. I am told that\
  \ someone somewhere is developing a show called Spot And Thog, or possibly Thog\
  \ And Spot. There are also unconfirmed reports that someone else somewhere else\
  \ is working on a rival show in which Spot is merely one of the shapes into which\
  \ Thog shifts, so that Thog and Spot are essentially one and the same.\nAlain de\
  \ Botton has written perceptively about the Spot-Thog dichotomy, if it is indeed\
  \ a dichotomy, in his book 50 Things You Can Learn From Thog. It is a very thin\
  \ book indeed. I would like to say deceptively so, but I am not going to. It is\
  \ just very thin. In my view, for what it's worth, the things the Swiss brainbox\
  \ claims can be learned from Thog could equally well be learned by standing in a\
  \ puddle out on a blasted heath, like Luneberg, in driving rain, on a bank holiday\
  \ afternoon. I have tried this myself, on more than one occasion, and I learned\
  \ many, many things, many more than fifty if truth be told. I needed neither Spot\
  \ nor Thog nor Alain de Botton to help with these lessons. One day I shall impart\
  \ to you, in resounding prose, exactly what I learned, and you will be by turns\
  \ appalled, bewildered, cut up, despairing, eggbound, frolicsome, gooey, hysterical,\
  \ implacable, jinxed, knackered, loopy, and murderous, and that only accounts for\
  \ the first half of the alphabet. It also summarises only your likely reactions\
  \ to one of the many things I learned on Luneberg Heath. Imagine, then, the sheer\
  \ panoply of my emotions you will go through as you learn all the other things,\
  \ more than fifty of them, and each one more coherent than anything you will read\
  \ in the astounding and weird and uncanny and unnerving tales of Thog.\n[2012-10-08]"
