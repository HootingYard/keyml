text: "The Terracotta Army Parade Ground at the salubrious end of Sawdust Bridge is\
  \ closed to allow pointless works to take place. Much heavy machinery has been moved\
  \ into place from the important roadworks on the Blister Lane Bypass, causing snarl-ups.\
  \ The loudest of the machines will be switched on before dawn and chug and hiss\
  \ and hoot all day every day for the foreseeable future. Citizens without earplugs\
  \ who find themselves deafened should join the queue outside Dr Fang's Clinic. Appointments\
  \ will be made on an unthinking-fidelity-to-the-regime basis, but may be postponed\
  \ until such time as Dr Fang is released from protective custody. Every citizen\
  \ is expected to take part in the prevention of wolf attacks. The kiosk under the\
  \ viaduct on the lane leading to Pang Hill Orphanage is currently shrouded in mist.\
  \ It is an eerie and inexplicable mist, populated by seething teeming minuscule\
  \ flying and buzzing things which sting. Soothing ointments can be procured from\
  \ the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, if she can be found, for she is wandering in the wild\
  \ woods, jabbering under her breath, and communing with tadpoles. There is a new,\
  \ so-called \u201Cmodern windsock\u201D at the aerodrome. Verses in its praise should\
  \ be sent to the poetry editor of The Daily Hysterics for his consideration. Toffee\
  \ is hereby forbidden.\nSigned this day on behalf of the more irrational members\
  \ of the Pointy Town Chamber of Tyranny by Ned Mudbag, wretch and scrivener.\n[2014-01-16]"
