text: "When considering Borneo, it is extremely important to differentiate between\
  \ the Wild Man of Borneo and the Wild Men of Borneo. The first thing to grasp is\
  \ that the Wild Man of Borneo was not one of the Wild Men of Borneo. Obviously,\
  \ he was a Wild Man, and thus if one lumps together, indiscriminately, all the Wild\
  \ Men of Borneo, then one is forced to concede that the Wild Man of Borneo was,\
  \ in the round, one among the Wild Men of Borneo. But in another respect, and one\
  \ that is crucial, as we shall see, the Wild Man of Borneo was not, by any stretch\
  \ of the imagination, one of the Wild Men of Borneo.\nA second point. of utmost\
  \ importance, is to bear in mind that neither the Wild Man of Borneo nor the Wild\
  \ Men of Borneo had any connection whatsoever, apart from the nominative, with Borneo.\
  \ All three\u2014for there was but one Wild Man of Borneo, obviously, and, less\
  \ obviously, two Wild Men of Borneo\u2014were citizens of the United States of America.\
  \ The Wild Man of Borneo was originally German and arrived in the United States\
  \ as a teenager, while the Wild Men of Borneo were natives, the one born in New\
  \ York and the other in Ohio.\nTo be absolutely clear, I ought to confess that in\
  \ the foregoing I have ridden chronologically kim-kam, putting the Wild Man of Borneo\
  \ before the Wild Men of Borneo. In truth the Wild Men of Borneo (born in 1825 and\
  \ 1827) precede the Wild Man of Borneo (born in 1862).\nWe can perhaps better distinguish\
  \ the Wild Men of Borneo from the Wild Man of Borneo by lodging their given names\
  \ in our heads. The Wild Men of Borneo were Hiram W. Davis and his younger brother\
  \ Barney Davis. The Wild Man of Borneo was Leonard Borchardt.\nWithout wishing to\
  \ complicate things further, it is well worth noting that the latter, the Wild Man\
  \ of Borneo, was commonly known as Oofty-Goofty. He acquired this sobriquet from\
  \ his habit, when covered in tar and horsehair and locked in a cage and fed raw\
  \ meat, of uttering a fierce cry of \u201COofty-Goofty!\u201D. Neither of the Wild\
  \ Men of Borneo is ever recorded as having used these words, if words is what they\
  \ are. The Wild Men of Borneo were noted rather for their prodigious feats of strength,\
  \ wrestling skills, and what used to be called mental imbecility.\nHaving digested\
  \ all of the above, we should be able with confidence to tell the Wild Man of Borneo\
  \ from the Wild Men of Borneo. Equally helpful, if not more so, is the knowledge\
  \ that, next time we disembark from a boat, its sails billowing in the southeast\
  \ Asian wind, upon the shores of Borneo, should we then encounter any wild men,\
  \ though they may be indubitably wild men of Borneo, given their wildness and location,\
  \ they will be neither the Wild Man of Borneo nor the Wild Men of Borneo, with all\
  \ three of whom we are now serviceably familiar.\nIt would be interesting to know\
  \ if either the Wild Man of Borneo, or the Wild Men of Borneo, had a familiar, in\
  \ the sense of a grimalkin or witch's familiar. I do not think any of them did,\
  \ but I would not wish to pronounce upon this definitively without learning more,\
  \ much, much more, about both the Wild Man of Borneo and the Wild Men of Borneo.\n\
