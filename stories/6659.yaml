text: "Hello there. I am the King. See my crown. See my sceptre. See my baubles and\
  \ my magnificence. I am like unto a god, am I not? When I snap my fingers, equerries\
  \ come sprinting. They fawn and scrape. I demand sausages, and sausages are fetched.\
  \ I demand the sun to be blotted out, and the sun is blotted out. I demand the head\
  \ of my enemy impaled upon an iron spike, and my enemy is tracked to his lair and\
  \ beheaded and his head is impaled upon an iron spike and it is brought to me by\
  \ my equerries. If I should change my mind and wish to unbehead my enemy and show\
  \ him mercy, to have him skip and frolic about the palace for my amusement, then\
  \ his head is plucked from the spike and glued back on to his neck and his body\
  \ is animated by fearsome bolts of electricity and he jerks and skips and frolics\
  \ as is my whim. Should I wish to engage him in conversation a ventriloquist is\
  \ found, in some remote village, and brought to the palace to practise his skills.\
  \ The conversation might go something like this:\nKing \u2013 When you have finished\
  \ skipping and frolicking, would you like a bite of my sausage?\nEnemy\u2014Oh yes\
  \ please Sire!\nKing \u2013 Then a bite of my sausage you shall have! Cease your\
  \ cavortings and chew!\nEnemy\u2014Thank you Sire!\nThen one of my equerries will\
  \ work the jaws of my enemy, by sleight of hand, to bite off a portion of sausage.\
  \ Further bolts of electricity will be applied if necessary, when the equerry is\
  \ standing well back, unless the equerry is dispensable. Some equerries are, some\
  \ aren't. To help me remember which is which I have them wear different-coloured\
  \ caps. I designed the caps myself, for I take a great deal of interest in uniforms\
  \ and insignia. When an equerry wears incorrect dress, or is insufficiently spruce,\
  \ I fly into a rage and order the laying waste of that part of my kingdom from whence\
  \ the offending equerry hails. Alas, there are fibbing equerries, and on occasion\
  \ entirely innocent parts of the kingdom have been obliterated by fire and sword.\
  \ This is how it might happen:\nKing\u2014You are wearing the Emblazured Ribbon\
  \ of Gack on your left arm instead of your right, you scruffy ingrate! Tell me from\
  \ what part of my kingdom you hail!\nEquerry (fibbing)\u2014From Sniggleby Marshes,\
  \ Sire!\nKing\u2014Then Sniggleby Marshes shall be laid waste this very hour!\n\
  Equerry\u2014Yes Sire, I shall see to it at once!\nShort of inventing a truth serum\
  \ it is not clear to me how such misobliterations can be avoided. Mind you, I have\
  \ invented many other things. I invented the self-polishing crown, the hovering\
  \ kingly orb, and the regal smokers\u2019 poptart toasting fork, not to mention\
  \ a special cushion upon which to rest my swollen head. It is a speaking cushion.\
  \ As soon as it comes into contact with my head, it tells me, repeatedly, in my\
  \ own kingly voice, what a fantastic and magnificent king I am. The glorious words\
  \ travel through my ears into my brain, just as these glorious words I am speaking\
  \ now travel through your ears, O peasants, into your brains. An equerry wrote the\
  \ speech for me. Which reminds me, I had better check what colour his cap is. I\
  \ shall do so now. You may rise from where you sprawl in the muck and go about your\
  \ business, tilling the fields, bringing in the sheaves. Begone!\n[2011-06-01]"
