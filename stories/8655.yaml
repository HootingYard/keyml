text: "From today's Grauniad. Well worth memorising (and adding to).\nEngland's drought\
  \ draws attention to the condition of England's rivers. And England's rivers\u2014\
  with those in Scotland and Wales\u2014have ancient names, often conferred before\
  \ the Roman legions came, and passed down almost unchanged to the present. Daily\
  \ Mail spread on the misery that will last all summer featured the Bewl, the Chess\
  \ and the Pang. But these are just the start. What about the Mease, the Tees, the\
  \ Dee, the Cree, the Nar, the Ter and the Ver? Or the Box, the Yox and the Axe?\
  \ Or the Neet, the Fleet and the Smite? Do not forget, either, the Ebble, the Piddle,\
  \ the Polly, the Nadder or the Wandle. Or the Feshie, the Mashie and the Wissey.\
  \ Then there are the Lugg, the Ugie, the Meggat, the Tud, the Lud and the Irt. Like\
  \ these other rivers, the Wampool, the Snizort, the Skirfare, the Deveron, the Cocker\
  \ and the Stinchar speak of a deep Britain, to which we are more connected than\
  \ we realise. Or would be if it rained.\n[2012-03-14]"
