text: "The other day, in my potsage [sic] about a man of the cloth, I made reference\
  \ to a dough cormorant. Since then I have been inundated with letters from readers\
  \ asking how they might go about making one. I am happy to report that the fashioning\
  \ of a dough cormorant is child's play\u2014with two provisos. First, you need to\
  \ ensure your dough is of the correct consistency, and second, you must have a basic\
  \ understanding of bird anatomy, with particular reference to the cormorant.\nRegarding\
  \ the dough, you will need the physical strength to knead it, thoroughly, to achieve\
  \ the right consistency. If you are too weedy to knead, you may have to consider\
  \ employing a professional dough-kneader, and they don't come cheap, at least in\
  \ my experience. Recently, in connection with a different project, one not involving\
  \ cormorants, I needed a supply of dough of very precise heft, and I was simply\
  \ not up to the task. At the time, I was convalescing from an injury sustained in\
  \ an accident when, funnily enough, a deranged cormorant was let loose in the confines\
  \ of a baker's pantry in which I happened to be present. Upon my release from hospital,\
  \ and bent on my dough-related project, I had no option but to hire the services\
  \ of a professional kneader, and it cost me an arm and a leg. Not literally of course.\
  \ I doubt that a kneader exacting such a price would attract much custom, although\
  \ I am willing to entertain the idea that in certain circumstances a person could\
  \ become so dough-desperate that they would pay it.\nThe consistency of your dough\
  \ will be as nought, however, if you are bird-ignorant. Let me put it as plainly\
  \ as I can. You will need to know what a cormorant looks like. The cormorant is\
  \ a type of bird, and birds are those things you see flying overhead, silhouetted\
  \ against the sky. But it is well worth bearing in mind that not everything you\
  \ see flying overhead is necessarily a bird. If it is enormous, and metallic, and\
  \ has jet engines, it is almost certainly an aeroplane. Conversely, if it is tiny,\
  \ so tiny that it is barely visible, it is likely to be a midge or a gnat. There\
  \ are all sorts of other things that appear flying or hovering or being buffetted\
  \ which are not birds, such as bees and wasps and hornets and wind-borne plastic\
  \ carrier bags and heat-seeking missiles, to name but five.\nSeveral types of bird,\
  \ including the cormorant, are mentioned in the Bible. The theologian Loptap has\
  \ argued, convincingly, that almost all birds are Roman Catholic, although one or\
  \ two espouse Lutheranism, and chaffinches are notoriously godless. Personally,\
  \ I have grave doubts about the partridge, but as a general rule let Loptap be your\
  \ guide.\nYou can work out the differences between the cormorant and that well nigh\
  \ limitless class of things-which-are-not-a-cormorant by studying diagrams and drawings\
  \ in books such as The Bumper Book Of Diagrams And Drawings Of Cormorants.\nWhen\
  \ you are reasonably sure that you know what a cormorant looks like, simply take\
  \ your lump of dough and mould it into the appropriate shape. Hey presto! You have\
  \ a dough cotmorant.\nTo satisfy yourself that your dough cormorant is of an acceptable\
  \ standard, and will not be mistaken for a dough model of another bird, or worse,\
  \ of that-which-is-not-a-cormorant, it is a good idea to compare it with photographs\
  \ in books such as The Bumper Book Of Photographs Of Dough Cormorants.\nIn nomine\
  \ patris et filii spiritus sancti.\n[2017-03-01]"
