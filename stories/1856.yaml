text: "In looking through Thaumaturgia, or Elucidations Of The Marvellous the other\
  \ day, for that quotation about the delusional glass man, I came across this:\n\
  We shall conclude our astrological strictures with the following advertisement,\
  \ which affords as fine a satirical specimen of quackery as is to be met with. It\
  \ is extracted from \u201Cpoor Robin's\u201D almanack for 1773; and may not be without\
  \ its use, to many at the present day. We will vouch for it being harmless, but\
  \ as we are not in the secret of all that it contains, our readers must endeavour\
  \ to get the information that may be wanted, on certain important points, from other\
  \ quarters\u2026\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\u201CThe best time to cut hair. How moles and\
  \ dreams are to be interpreted. When most proper season to bleed. Under what aspect\
  \ of the moon best to draw teeth, and cut corns. Pairing of nails, on what day unlucky.\
  \ What the kindest sign to graft or inoculate in; to open bee-hives, and kill swine.\
  \ How many hours boiling my Lady Kent's pudding requires. With other notable questions,\
  \ fully and faithfully resolved, by me Sylvester Patridge, student in physic and\
  \ astrology, near the Gun in Moorfields.\u201D\n\u201COf whom likewise may be had,\
  \ at reasonable rates, trusses, antidotes, elixirs, love-powders. Washes for freckles,\
  \ plumpers, glass-eyes, false calves and noses, ivory-jaws, and a new receipt to\
  \ turn red hair into black.\u201D\n[2009-02-20]"
