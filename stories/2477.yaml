text: "Immediately after God's revelation on the third, fourth, and fifth of February\
  \ 1652 to John Reeve that he and his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton were the \u201C\
  Two Last Witnesses\u201D\u2026\n\u201CThere followed a period of hectic blessing\
  \ and cursing which could have been lifted straight from the pages of Edwards's\
  \ Gangraena. A few examples will convey the flavour. John Robins, and a rival prophet\
  \ [Thomas] Tany, were cursed and destroyed. A man called Pearson smote blows on\
  \ Muggleton's head; ten days later he was dead. At a Ranter tavern in the Minories\
  \ Reeve placed his head on the ground for an enemy to trample upon. The infidel's\
  \ foot was arrested in flight. He could not go through with it. Muggleton noted\
  \ \u2018the people all marvelled at this thing\u2019. Barker tricked Reeve into\
  \ blessing him, but was then exposed and damned by Muggleton. An over-zealous follower\
  \ called Cooper cursed fifteen fellow silk-weavers off his own bat. The cynical\
  \ Captain Stasy arranged dinner for the prophets with Goffin, a divine. The dinner\
  \ ended with a predictable damnation for the clergyman.\u201D\nFrom The World Of\
  \ The Muggletonians, Christopher Hill, Barry Reay, William Lamont (1983).\nElsewhere\
  \ we discover that Lodowicke Muggleton was himself cursed by that saintly Quaker\
  \ William Penn: \u201CTo the bottomless pit are you sentenced, from whence you came,\
  \ and where the endless worm shall gnaw and torture your imaginary soul to eternity.\u201D\
  \ I am not clear whether this curse was pronounced before or after Muggleton published\
  \ a pamphlet with the resounding title The Neck Of The Quakers Broken (1663).\n\
