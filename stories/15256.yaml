text: "A gastronome and a dramaturge were out a-walking one day when they became engulfed\
  \ in an eerie purple mist. Though they knew it not, it was the sort of mist beloved\
  \ of writers of phantasmal stories. In these tales, those exposed to the mephitic\
  \ vapours emerge somehow changed. See, for example, the film The Incredible Shrinking\
  \ Man, or, lethally, The Purple Cloud by M. P. Shiel.\nWhat happened in the present\
  \ case was that the pair eventually stumbled out of the mist transformed into a\
  \ gastroturge and a dramanome. At first they were unaware of the change the mist\
  \ had wrought. They walked on, o'er the flint-strewn fields, until they reached\
  \ the clump of pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing, where\
  \ they shook hands and parted, promising to meet each other at the same spot the\
  \ next day to go a-walking again.\nIt would be worth devoting a paragraph to that\
  \ handshake, had I the words to describe it, or to convey its immense significance.\
  \ What it was not was the kind of coded handshake performed by members of secret\
  \ societies to signal to each other their shared affiliation. Rather, it was to\
  \ all intents and purposes a perfectly normal and unremarkable handshake. Had you\
  \ witnessed it, if, say, you were a peewit perched on the pollarded stub of a branch\
  \ of one of those willows, you would very likely notice nothing unusual, and fly\
  \ away, bored. Can birds be bored? That is a query for another occasion, when we\
  \ are concerned with ornithological psychology rather than with gastroturgy and\
  \ dramanomery, our current preoccupations.\nWe will continue into a second paragraph\
  \ with the handshake, for we are not done with it yet. There is a verse by Dennis\
  \ Beerpint where the poet writes, famously, In vegetation and in awe / They made\
  \ a handshake last for hours. This was not that sort of handshake. It lasted for\
  \ only a few moments, like the average handshake. It involved no special grasp,\
  \ nor funny business. The right hands of the gastroturge and the dramanome, the\
  \ ones they shook, were as near as dammit matched in size and in finger-numbers,\
  \ in neither case being deformed in any way nor outwith the standard lineaments\
  \ of the adult human hand. Look at the diagrams in Di Boffo's Gallery Of Standardised\
  \ Anatomical Limb Appendages, Book IV, and you will see etchings that could be drawn\
  \ from posings by the gastroturge and the dramanome in person, had they been alive\
  \ at the time of publication.\nWhich is by way of saying, as we embark on a third\
  \ paragraph devoted to the subject, that there really was nothing remarkable about\
  \ the handshake at all, save for the fact that it was remarkable. The difficulty\
  \ is in articulating, in plain words, what was so remarkable about it. And believe\
  \ me, it was, oh! it certainly was! The peewit\u2014or the putative peewit\u2014\
  may well have flown away, bored, but we should not rely on a bored bird to tell\
  \ us about the fathomless intricacies of human interaction, particularly when that\
  \ bored bird is merely a notional bird invented as a conceit. It need not even be\
  \ a peewit. It could equally well be a starling or a chaffinch.\nBut let us not\
  \ labour the point, babbling into yet another handshake-fixated paragraph. We know\
  \ the handshake was of immense significance. We know we have not the words to explain\
  \ why. It may be a solace to recognise that the fictional peewit, or starling, or\
  \ chaffinch, is in an even worse position, having no words at all, not even inadequate\
  \ words, but merely tweetings and chirrups and similar birdy witterings at its disposal.\
  \ Also, birds\u2019 brains are tiny, much smaller than the brains of the gastroturge\
  \ and the dramanome. And those brains, albeit both bigger than a bird's, were about\
  \ to succumb to unimaginable mental chaos.\nLet us not forget that they entered\
  \ the eerie purple mist as a gastronome and a dramaturge. Yet when they emerged,\
  \ they had been transformed, in some inexplicable manner, into a gastroturge and\
  \ a dramanome. As they shook hands by the clump of pollarded willows by the canal\
  \ just before the level crossing, and parted, taking their divergent paths home,\
  \ neither was aware of what had befallen them. Only slowly, as the day wore on,\
  \ and their brains struggled to comprehend the cataclysmic changes, did the gastroturge\
  \ and the dramanome begin to exhibit erratic patterns of behaviour. At first these\
  \ were barely perceptible. But by the next morning, both of them had gone completely\
  \ doolally.\nBy midday, less than twenty four hours since they had been engulfed\
  \ in the eerie purple mist, both the gastroturge and the dramanome were under lock\
  \ and key, confined in neighbouring secure wards in a Bewilderment Home. And there\
  \ they would remain, for years to come, until boffins could work out a method of\
  \ switching turge to nome, and nome to turge, without having to wrench their heads\
  \ off their necks, or commit some similar, almost certainly fatal, procedure.\n\
  Meanwhile, the pair sat peering out of their windows at a peewit perched on the\
  \ pollarded stub of a willow. Birds have no hands to shake, in greeting or in parting.\
  \ Take note of that fact. It may prove useful to you, in the coming days.\n[2017-02-14]"
