text: "\nPansy Cradledew draws to my attention this title from a small collection\
  \ of Victorian Yellowjackets*. Alas, I have never read Misery Junction by Richard\
  \ Henry, and I find myself wondering if the story is set in one of the notorious\
  \ junctions and sidings of the Hooting Yard to O'Houlihan's Wharf Branch\_Line.\
  \ There, Misery Junction is the foul rainswept junction between two other junctions,\
  \ one called Moral Squalor Junction and the other known as Pretty Little Dandelion\
  \ Junction. It should be noted that the pretty little dandelions growing so profusely\
  \ around the railway lines at that spot were contaminated with some kind of toxin,\
  \ and the pretty little ponies which cantered up to them for a lunchtime chew were\
  \ swiftly carted off to the knackers yard, stone dead.\n* NOTE\_: Pansy quite rightly\
  \ points out that I have confused a series of 19th century paperbacks (Yellowbacks)\
  \ with a type of wasp (Yellowjacket). Such an easy mistake to make.\n[2009-03-12]"
