text: "According to David Attenborough on BBC Radio 4's Tweet Of The Day this morning,\
  \ the sound made by the storm petrel has been described as \u201Clike a fairy being\
  \ sick\u201D. Conversely, in Lands of Faerie, for example in Cottingley, where the\
  \ fairies are made of paper, a fairy being sick is compared to a storm petrel.\n\
  One might find it hard to imagine a fairy, especially a paper one, vomiting. But\
  \ the Land of Faerie is (mostly) invisible to (most of) us. It is a parallel world\
  \ where, could we see it, much would be familiar to us, albeit skewed and distorted.\
  \ So, yes, fairies are sometimes sick, just as we are sometimes sick. But what they\
  \ vomit up is not the same as what we vomit up. Yes, fairies shop for groceries\
  \ in supermarkets with an increasing number of self-service tills, but they buy\
  \ different groceries, in supermarkets which dimly resemble our own, and the protocol\
  \ for self-service tills is like something from the fourteenth century. Fairies\
  \ travel on buses, but not on our buses. I could go on.\nDo you want me to go on?\
  \ Or would you rather I shut up, so you can put on a pair of stout walking boots,\
  \ and hike out to the seaside, in hope of finding a colony of storm petrels, so\
  \ you can make a tape recording of their cries, and, later, back home, play it while\
  \ reading a bedtime story to your tinies, that much-loved story from your own childhood,\
  \ the one about the oh so delightful fluttering paper fairy that caught a stomach\
  \ bug and vomited up a mess of fairy pottage, into a fairy bucket, in a little fairy\
  \ cottage in Cottingley, and they called for a doctor, and the doctor who came hurrying\
  \ across the fields with his black bag was Dr Arthur Conan Doyle?\n[2013-05-29]"
