text: "As noted a few days ago, I have now begun reading Ruskin's Fors Clavigera.\
  \ Its eccentricity, adverted to by Guy Davenport, has already become apparent. Here\
  \ is an extract from Letter II, The Great Picnic.\nI. That the strength of Hercules\
  \ is for deed, not misdeed ; and that his club\u2014the favourite weapon, also,\
  \ of the Athenian hero Theseus, whose form is the best inheritance left to us by\
  \ the greatest of Greek sculptors, (it is in the Elgin room of the British Museum,\
  \ and I shall have much to tell you of him\u2014especially how he helped Hercules\
  \ in his utmost need, and how he invented mixed vegetable soup)\u2014was for subduing\
  \ monsters and cruel persons, and was of olive-wood.\n(My emphasis.)\nIt may be\
  \ that my classical education is scanty, but I had no idea mixed vegetable soup\
  \ was invented by Theseus. I am hoping, with undisguised excitement, that Ruskin\
  \ keeps his promise and tells me more about this in a subsequent letter.\n\_\n[2009-05-04]"
