text: "If I knew the first thing about the ballet, I would tell you all about Crepingeour's\
  \ ground-breaking work King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor,\
  \ And Its Chatelaine. It was literally a ground-breaking ballet, in that some of\
  \ the steps choreographed involved tremendously heavy thumping, in big boots, upon\
  \ caked mud. But alas and alack, I completely lack ballet chops. So instead I will\
  \ turn my attention to King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor,\
  \ And Its Chatelaine, the play by Pickles on which the ballet is based. My source\
  \ is Basing Ballets On Pickles Plays\_: A Study Of Crepingeour And His Followers\
  \ In The Crepingeourist School by Biff Blunkett, the noted balletomane and Crepingeourist.\
  \ I had best press on before I get bogged down in further folderol.\nThe plot of\
  \ King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera is so convoluted that I am not going to attempt\
  \ to summarise it here. What you need to know is that the setting is a castle, belonging\
  \ to King Jasper, situated on a bleak promontory overlooking a bleaker sea. The\
  \ castle's electrical wiring system is as complicated as the plot of the play, if\
  \ not more so. Its maintenance and seemingly endless tweaking and repair is the\
  \ responsibility of the janitor, who is employed by the castle's chatelaine. Neither\
  \ the janitor nor the chatelaine has a given name, though whether this is an oversight\
  \ on Pickles\u2019 part, or an oh so clever literary device, is moot. Arguments\
  \ have been thrashed out on both sides. There are other Pickles plays with nameless\
  \ characters, some where characters swap their names around between acts, and several\
  \ where, though every character has a name, those names are unpronounceable in any\
  \ human tongue, or indeed in bestial grunts, howls, or birdsong. Not for nothing\
  \ is Pickles labelled a \u201Cdifficult\u201D playwright, just as he was called\
  \ a \u201Cdifficult\u201D child by those paid to watch over him in his infancy.\n\
  But King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera is not, in itself, a difficult play, for either\
  \ actors or audience. Indeed it is often the case that the cast, whether professional\
  \ or amateur, will dispense with rehearsals entirely, and simply jump on to a stage\
  \ impromptu and start performing it. The only people who are disconcerted by this\
  \ are the scene-shifters, who become all a-dither. Still, from what I have read,\
  \ that is only to be expected of scene-shifters. See for example Biff Blunkett's\
  \ magisterial study Dithering Scene-Shifters In Theatrical Performances Of Pickles\
  \ Plays. That said, Pickles has to bear some responsibility for the dithering, for\
  \ his plays have become notorious among scene-shifters for their rapid and bewildering\
  \ shifts of scene. In King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera, for example, Act One alone\
  \ requires twenty-two different sets in its seven separate scenes, as can be tabulated\
  \ by a competent tabulator with an eagle on the script, as follows:\nScene One\_\
  : The pantry in King Jasper's castle\u2014a greyhound racing stadium\u2014hotel\
  \ lobby\u2014the castle drawbridge.\nScene Two\_: Electrical wiring cupboard in\
  \ the castle\u2014plague pit\u2014castle balcony.\nScene Three\_: Hell.\nScene Four\_\
  : Bates Motel\u2014interior of giant Jiffy bag\u2014apple orchard\u2014pear orchard\u2014\
  jetty.\nScene Five\_: The castle larder\u2014the castle oubliette\u2014the O.K.\
  \ Corral\u2014persimmon orchard\u2014 chatelaine's boudoir.\nScene Six\_: Uncle\
  \ Tom's cabin\u2014King Jasper's cabin\u2014janitor's cubby.\nScene Seven\_: The\
  \ Great Hall of King Jasper's castle\nThose of you who have not seen the play might\
  \ infer from this competently tabulated tabulation that it must be hard to follow\
  \ the action, what with so many changes of scene, even, as we can see, within the\
  \ same scene, to the point where one calls into question quite what Pickles meant\
  \ by the word \u201Cscene\u201D in the first place. But that would be to underestimate\
  \ the sheer genius of Pickles\u2019 stagecraft. Also, if you have not actually seen\
  \ the play in performance you would have no appreciation of its exceedingly slow\
  \ pace. Think snails, and lame snails at that. Snails on crutches. Snails on crutches\
  \ battling against a gale force wind. Uphill. At a steep gradient. Think even steeper.\n\
  Why, then, does a critic as acute as Biff Blunkett insist, more than once, that\
  \ the play \u201Cfairly rattles along\u201D? Is he obtuse rather than acute? Is\
  \ he a fool? Has he been watching a completely different play all this time? That\
  \ is a possibility. It is not only scene-shifters who get all a-dither in the face\
  \ of Pickles\u2019 dramaturgy, but the printers of playbills and publicity posters\
  \ too. Blunkett himself has written a magnificent and coruscating study of this\
  \ very issue in his A Magnificent And Coruscating Study Of The Issue Of Dithering\
  \ Playbill And Publicity Poster Printers Of Pickles Plays. If you only read one\
  \ of Biff Blunkett's verbose and prolix spoutings, this is the one worthy of your\
  \ attention. The chapter in which he sounds a warning regarding the tendency to\
  \ confuse King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor, And Its\
  \ Chatelaine with Pickles\u2019 companion piece King Jasper's Castle, Its Gas Mantles,\
  \ Its Chatelaine, And Its Janitor is particularly magnificent, though not quite\
  \ as coruscating as it might be, all things considered. Among the things considered\
  \ should be the fact that Blunkett was bedridden with double pneumonia and a collapsed\
  \ lung when he wrote it.\nRumours are afoot that a young hothead Crepingeourist\
  \ is at work on a ballet based on King Jasper's Castle, Its Gas Mantles, Its Chatelaine,\
  \ And Its Janitor. If so, that will be something to see, at least for balletomanes.\
  \ The rest of us can spend a profitable evening queuing up at a soup kitchen.\n\
