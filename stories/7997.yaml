text: 'It seems to be the done thing on various blogs to mark the end of the year
  by pointing readers to highlights of the twelvemonth we are about to leave behind.
  But quite frankly, I can''t be bothered to trawl back through the 495 postages (before
  this one) which I tippy-tapped out in 2011. Dutiful readers will of course spend
  the final hours of the year as they usually do, rereading the entire Hooting Yard
  archive while making notes with a pencil in a jotter. And then, at the stroke of
  midnight, you can put on your pointy hat and raise a glass of aerated lettucewater
  in celebration, for a minute or two, before returning to your reading.

  I will be setting a series of tests early in 2012, to make sure you have been paying
  attention. Meanwhile, I wish you all a very happy new year, and thank you for your
  enthusiasm and support.
