  To justify the expedition's scientific aims the Admiralty and the Royal Society\
  \ donated chronometers and compasses\u2014the Isabella carried seven different models\
  \ of each\u2014plus a number of other instruments, among them Henry Kater's Pendulum\
  \ for measuring the ellipticity of the globe, Mr Plentty's Cork Life Boat, Englefield's\
  \ Mountain Barometer and Companion, Burt's Buoy and Knipper, Trengrouse's Apparatus\
  \ for Saving Lives, and Troughton's Whirling Horizon. John Ross would later contribute\
  \ to the array with a dredging device of his own invention which he whimsically\
  \ christened \u2018the Deep Sea Clamm\u2019.\nFergus Fleming, Barrow's Boys (1998)\n\
