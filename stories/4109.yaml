text: "For some time now, I have been considering making a proper study of the hoof-patterns\
  \ imprinted in mud or snow by celebrities. I speak, of course, of those celebrities\
  \ who are hooved, either because they are centaurs, or are goat-footed beasts spawned\
  \ by Beelzebub. The latter is often true of those celebrities one commonly sees\
  \ only from the waist, or indeed neck, up. Celebrity centaurs are rarer, but can\
  \ easily be spotted by the eye trained to spot such things. \u201CCentaurs\u201D\
  , incidentally, is an anagram of \u201CEtruscan\u201D. That is well worth remembering.\n\
  It will be objected that the last thing the world needs is for Hooting Yard to descend\
  \ into the brain-dead realm of celebrity fixation, and I agree. See me nod. See\
  \ me nod more. See me nod so much my head all but detaches itself and rolls along\
  \ the lane into a ditch. See a cloud of flies settle upon my head in the ditch and\
  \ poke their probosces into my scalp to suck upon my brain. See Old Farmer Frack\
  \ disperse the flies with fumes from his aerosol repellant canister. See Old Farmer\
  \ Frack pick up my head and place it in his sack. See Old Farmer Frack trudge along\
  \ the lane swinging my head in a sack as he heads for the eerie barn.\nSorry, where\
  \ was I? Ah yes, celebrity hoof patterns. They have much to teach us, and I do not\
  \ think we should ignore those lessons just because of celebrity involvement. For\
  \ example, it was reported to me by an unimpeachable source that a trail of hoof\
  \ imprints left in an Alpine snowdrift by a well-known celebrity centaur from the\
  \ world of television cookery programmes shows an identical pattern\u2014identical!\u2014\
  to the disposition of sightseers on the grassy knoll in Dallas at the very moment\
  \ of the first shot from Lee Harvey Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle on 22nd November\
  \ 1963. Unfortunately, because the snowdrift melted, as snowdrifts do, this cannot\
  \ be independently verified.\_ Those of you muttering that I ought to have inserted\
  \ the word \u201Callegedly\u201D somewhere alongside Oswald's name should go and\
  \ read your Posner.\nA second example, again well attested, is the extraordinary\
  \ set of hoofprints left in mud by a Booker Prize-nominated celebrity goat devil\
  \ in Penge. The pattern formed by the prints, viewed from a certain angle, in a\
  \ certain light, on certain days, in certain mirrors, appears to spell out a line\
  \ or two from the Book of Revelation, if written in spidery handwriting by a hamfisted\
  \ shaking person. I have seen a blurred black and white photograph of this phenomenon,\
  \ and I am convinced.\nThere is much more material, suitable for a lavish coffee\
  \ table book. Both the book and the coffee table designed to uphold it will be lavish,\
  \ the latter perhaps more so than the former. It will be built from wood, teak or\
  \ mahogany, stained with the most excellent varnish available, each leg carved to\
  \ form a mythological figure, representing in turn Europe, America, Africa and Asia,\
  \ similar to that of the splendid wooden carvings on the massive pulpit in St Peter's\
  \ church in the university town of Leuven in Brabant. The sole deviation from the\
  \ standard iconography will be that each figure will have the hooves of a goat,\
  \ embedded in wooden mud or snow.\nWooden mud, ah! It is a fine, fine thing.\n[2010-03-29]"
