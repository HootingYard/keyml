text: "Yesterday I listened, belatedly, to a Little Atoms interview with Jonathan\
  \ Meades. (It's available for download here\u2014the second one, dated 11 May 2007,\
  \ though the earlier interview is well worth your attention too.) Each Little Atoms\
  \ show has a musical interlude, often chosen by the guest. The magnificent Meades,\
  \ perhaps the only reason to watch television these days, picked La canzone dell'amore\
  \ perduto by Fabrizio de Andr\xE9. Not being at all familiar with Italian cantautores\
  \ of the late twentieth century, his name was new to me, but I adored the song,\
  \ so I decided to find out more. You can go and read his wikipedia entry, as I did,\
  \ and do further research if you so wish, as I haven't, yet.\nThe entry devotes\
  \ a paragraph to de Andr\xE9's kidnapping by Sardinian bandits in 1979, which is\
  \ interesting, but I thought I'd draw your attention to two other things, mentioned\
  \ in passing, that particularly intrigued me.\nDe Andr\xE9's first wife was named\
  \ Puny. This is a superbly Hooting Yardish name, isn't it? I do not think it will\
  \ be too long before a character named Puny turns up in a piece of prose here, perhaps\
  \ one that features heroic infant Tiny Enid. I recall that somewhere or other I\
  \ refer to a book or film entitled I Was Puny Vercingetorix, and though puny there\
  \ was intended as an adjective rather than as a first name, I may have to revisit\
  \ that in the light of my new knowledge.\nThe other thing that made me slap my forehead\
  \ with glee was the title of de Andr\xE9's second album\u2014or rather, the contrast\
  \ between it and the titles between which it was bracketed. (Forgive those two \u2018\
  between's, I can't think offhand of a more felicitous way of putting it.) The first\
  \ album was called Volume One, and the third was dubbed Volume Three. Yet for some\
  \ extraordinary reason, the title of what a lesser artist would have called Volume\
  \ Two was instead Tutti morimmo a stento, or We All Died Agonizingly.\nThat's the\
  \ thing about Jonathan Meades, he provides you with new and unexpected avenues to\
  \ explore, even when he's just picking a piece of music.\n[2007-06-04]"
