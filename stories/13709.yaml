  \ Paul Doherty, the gannet is \u201Cthe most pointy bird to be found in Britain\u201D\
  .\nI am indebted to Andy Martin for bringing this critically important information\
  \ to my attention. Mr Martin adds: \u201CI wish to pass a motion that the gannet\
  \ be adopted as the official emblem of Pointy Town, to appear on any heraldic designs,\
  \ flags, and stationery\u201D. I think we can consider that carried, nem. con.\n\
