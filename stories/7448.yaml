text: "Last night I watched the first episode of Derren Brown's new television series\
  \ \u201CThe Experiment\u201D. Is it possible, he asked, to hypnotise someone into\
  \ carrying out an assassination, and for them to have no memory of the deed? This\
  \ being a Derren Brown show, the answer was of course a resounding \u201Cyes!\u201D\
  . We watched as a harmless, affable young IT person was supplied with what he thought\
  \ was a loaded gun, placed into a trance, and then, in a crowded theatre, calmly\
  \ \u201Cshot\u201D a celebrity. The target was Stephen Fry.\nIt was all very entertaining,\
  \ but whereas we know (and he himself cheerfully admits) that Derren Brown is simply\
  \ a showman with a bag of tricks, it was evidence that your very own Mr Key is a\
  \ seer who can foretell the future. Back in the summer of 2009, I put these words\
  \ into the mouth of the bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead:\nYou will recall Digby\
  \ Smew, the fascist podcaster who first appeared in my book The Assassination Of\
  \ Stephen Fry.\nCue eldritch, spooky music as I stalk off into the mist in my cape\
  \ and wizardy hat.\n[2011-10-22]"
