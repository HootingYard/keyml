text: "The composer Peter Warlock (1894\u20131930)\u2014real name Philip Heseltine\u2014\
  was declared unfit for military service during the First World War on account of\
  \ general neurasthenia and \u201Can inability to micturate when mentally excited,\
  \ and especially in the presence of other people, with the consequence that he has\
  \ had occasional prolonged retention\u201D, according to a Harley Street doctor's\
  \ report.\nAs a seemingly fit young man swanning about London, he was subjected\
  \ to insults from \u201Cofficious patriots\u201D. His common retort to such persons\
  \ was to declaim one of his favourite quotations, from Samuel Butler's poem Psalm\
  \ Of Montreal:\nO brother-in-law to Mr. Spurgeon's haberdasher,\n  Who seasonest\
  \ also the skins of Canadian owls,\n  Thou callest trousers \u2018pants,\u2019 whereas\
  \ I call them \u2018trousers\u2019,\n  Therefore thou art in hell-fire, and may\
  \ the Lord pity thee!\n\n[2013-04-20]"
