text: "\nThere are two films I adore without reservation. Both of them have been constant\
  \ guiding influences on me, either consciously or in more subtle ways. One of them,\
  \ Jacques Rivette's Celine And Julie Go Boating (1974) I have seen umpteen times,\
  \ whereas the other, Peter Greenaway's A Walk Through H\_: The Reincarnation Of\
  \ An Ornithologist (1978), I saw once shortly after its release and only again last\
  \ year.\nOf course there are dozens, or hundreds, of other films I have relished\
  \ over the years, from Brief Encounter to Aguirre, The Wrath Of God, from Love And\
  \ Death to Random Harvest, but somehow those two have been my touchstones. I saw\
  \ them first when I was young, and they opened up new imaginative possibilities\
  \ to me. It would not be true to say that I haven't been bowled over by a film since\
  \ then, rather that I can't think of one that has given me precisely that sense\
  \ of wide-eyed surprised gleeful imaginative abandon.\nUntil yesterday, when I went\
  \ to see Brand Upon The Brain! by Guy Maddin. Hooting Yardists will need only to\
  \ know that the film takes place in a lighthouse orphanage on Black Notch island,\
  \ that the characters include a harp-playing teenage detective and an evil boffin\
  \ in his underground lab, and that communications are made via aerophones and a\
  \ foghorn, to understand my enthusiasm.\nHere is Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer:\
  \ \u201CBrand Upon The Brain! succeeds at one and the same time in functioning as\
  \ both a celebration and a deconstruction of the conscious and unconscious glories\
  \ of silent movies through the barely thirty years of their existence at the beginning\
  \ of the 20th century. Let us say simply and definitively that I have never seen\
  \ anything like it. The pace of the twelve chapters, told over the course of ninety-five\
  \ minutes, surges along, propelled by the archaic silent-movie storytelling device\
  \ of intertitles coupled with a faux-naif verbal narration\u2026[it] is one of the\
  \ most compelling avant-garde excursions into the narrative cinema ever.\u201D\n\
  Apparently the film is to be released on DVD next month, so everyone should buy\
  \ a copy. It is a work of genius.\n[2008-07-14]"
