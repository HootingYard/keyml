  \ Fantastic, Grotesque And Mysterious compiled and edited by Margaret Barton and\
  \ Osbert Sitwell (1930) reveals that the hunt for Jack the Ripper was a scene from\
  \ Edward Gorey:\nWhitechapel bristled with policemen, whose work was rendered infinitely\
  \ more difficult by the swarms of amateur detectives from the West End. Medical\
  \ students and newspaper reporters paraded the streets unconvincingly disguised\
  \ as women, and in every corner there lurked assassin-hunters in tennis shoes or\
  \ galoshes.\n[2011-06-27]"
