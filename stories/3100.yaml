text: "The mountain apothecary with his bag so black. Is it a bag or is it a sack?\
  \ He heaves it up the mountain on his back. It is full of pills and potions.\nBut\
  \ no one lives upon this peak. So as he climbs who does he seek? Ah, look, a goat,\
  \ a goat so weak. He'll pamper it with his lotions.\nThe mountain apothecary is\
  \ no vet. The weakened goat's our hero's pet. He trapped it once, within a net.\
  \ But now it roams the slopes.\nThe air is thin when one's so high. The goat is\
  \ weak and it may die. The apothecary wears a Catholic tie. He's treated several\
  \ Popes.\nA Papist apothecary, do you say? On the mountain this very day? I would\
  \ drown him in the bay, for I say he's a sinner.\nAye, a sinner and a heretic! Evil\
  \ is what makes him tick. Almighty God, he makes me sick. I'll vomit up my dinner.\n\
  I ate in the chalet at the foot of the mount. Me and a baron and a Protestant count.\
  \ Oh we ate a huge amount, of mountain goat and hog.\nSee the apothecary come back\
  \ down. He's taking his goat into the town, where there's a vet of great renown.\
  \ I'll shove him into the bog.\n\u201CPapist Apothecary Drowned In Bog\u201D, the\
  \ headline in my Daily Log. Now I'll march off into the fog, and vanish whence I\
  \ came.\nI came from haunts of coot and hern. There I watch the Papists burn. Repent!\
  \ Before it is your turn, and shudder at my name.\n[2009-09-14]"
