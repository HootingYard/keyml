text: "The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. He was microcephalic.\
  \ He had a tiny head. His hat was made of flowers and his coat was made of lead.\
  \ He fixed his gaze upon the sea and this is what he said:\n\u201CI am a tiny-headed\
  \ boy, alone upon the ocean. My head was of an average size until I drank a potion.\
  \ I drank it from a pot I found on a shelf upon the poop. A potion recommended on\
  \ Gwyneth Paltrow's website, Goop. The ingredients are rain and hail and dew and\
  \ melted snow, heated on the burning poop deck 'til they are aglow. When it's hot,\
  \ you gulp it down and say a little prayer. Oh burning ship! Oh boundless sea! Oh\
  \ solids, liquids, air! And soon enough you find your head will shrink until it's\
  \ tiny. And you stand upon the burning deck and sail across the briny.\u201D\nThe\
  \ boy stood on the ship in flames and resolved to say no more. He stared across\
  \ the sea until he came in sight of shore. And like the potion he had gulped, his\
  \ spirits were now aglow. Ahead of him lay the coast of the Land of Gwyneth Paltrow!\n\
