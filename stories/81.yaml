  \ What we expect, Mr Key, they all say, is regular lobster diagrams! We know what\
  \ we want and we want them weekly! Whether this is a true reflection of the popular\
  \ will or a sinister campaign to divert us from our important work I cannot say.\

  \ the subject of Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback, The Location Of The\
  \ Lobster's Brain.\n\n\_\n[2007-02-26]"
