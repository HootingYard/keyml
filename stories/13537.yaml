text: "Over the past few weeks I have been following an intriguing flurry of correspondence\
  \ in the readers\u2019 letters section of Bestial Grunting magazine. It began back\
  \ in October\u2014the \u201Cyellow month\u201D\u2014with a query from a certain\
  \ Mr. P. X. Pyx, who wrote \u201CI have been trying to obtain a map of Pointy Town,\
  \ without success. Can any of your readers point me in the right direction?\u201D\
  \nIn the next issue there were several replies, but most of them were facetious.\
  \ They suggested plenty of directions in which Mr. Pyx might point himself, but\
  \ the respondents were just having a spot of fun. The only sensible letter came\
  \ from someone who described themselves (in an unpublished addendum) as an Official\
  \ Pointy Town Tour Guide. It is worth mentioning here that such a position does\
  \ not exist, as the only known tour guides in Pointy Town are resolutely unofficial,\
  \ and proud of being so. But let that pass. This (unnamed) correspondent made the\
  \ not unreasonable point that Mr. Pyx needed to divulge his own location before\
  \ anybody could hope to have a clue in which direction he should be pointed in order\
  \ to face either Pointy Town itself or a kiosk where he might make purchase of a\
  \ map thereof. The editrix of Bestial Grunting awarded this letter five stars, and\
  \ rightly so.\nThe following week, a letter appeared undersigned \u201CMrs. P. X.\
  \ Pyx, grieving relict of Mr. P. X. Pyx\u201D. Alongside the printed, typeset version\
  \ of the letter, a photograph of the original was reproduced, showing the smudges\
  \ occasioned during its composition by Mrs. Pyx's fallen tears, the better for readers\
  \ to appreciate her grief. The widow explained that her late husband had dutifully\
  \ followed the sundry pieces of advice given by the facetious letter-writers in\
  \ the previous issue, but that in pointing himself in dozens of different directions\
  \ at great speed, he had become dizzy in the head, and toppled over, and fallen\
  \ into a pit of vipers he happened to be standing next to at the time. Mrs. Pyx\
  \ added the plea that she herself now sought advice on obtaining a map of Pointy\
  \ Town, as it was her dearest wish that her husband be buried clutching said map\
  \ in his cold dead white hands, as soon as the authorities had devised a method\
  \ of safely extricating his corpse from the viper pit. She did not divulge her location.\
  \ Her letter was not awarded any stars by the editrix.\nBy the time the next issue\
  \ of the magazine appeared, it was November, the \u201Cmonth of chrysanthemums\u201D\
  . Much of the letters page was taken up with protests that Mrs. Pyx had not been\
  \ given any stars. Several readers threatened to cancel their subscriptions unless\
  \ this injustice was corrected. The editrix devoted a full page elsewhere in the\
  \ issue to a carefully-argued piece explaining her decision. Stars, she wrote, were\
  \ not awarded lightly, and she was damned if she was going to cave in to the demands\
  \ of her more petulant readers who misunderstood the protocols. The article was\
  \ accompanied by a photograph of the letters editor plucking a star from the night\
  \ sky, preliminary to affixing it to the print-ready page.\nEagle-eyed readers would\
  \ have noticed, buried beneath all the letters of protest, a further letter from\
  \ the soi-disant Official Pointy Town Tour Guide. He wrote that he was due to meet\
  \ a mysterious \u201Ccontact\u201D, at a crossroads at midnight, who dangled before\
  \ him the possibility that he\u2014the \u201Ccontact\u201D\u2014might identify a\
  \ kiosk where a map of Pointy Town could be obtained, though only for rental, rather\
  \ than purchase outright.\nI missed the next issue of Bestial Grunting by dint of\
  \ [illegible].\nGod alone knows what happened, but in the fortnight since I'd bought\
  \ a copy, the magazine had changed utterly. It was now called New Bestial Grunting,\
  \ the editrix had become the editrix-in-chief, the letters editor had been demoted\
  \ to office janitor, and the readers\u2019 letters page had vanished. In its place\
  \ was a sheet of burnt and blackened paper giving off a distinct whiff of sulphur.\
  \ When I tried to return the magazine to the newsagent, thinking it might just be\
  \ a faulty copy, I found his kiosk shuttered and boarded up, and daubed with the\
  \ sign of the cross.\nCould all this be connected in some way to the dead Mr. Pyx\
  \ and the quick Mrs. Pyx and their desire to obtain a map of Pointy Town? I had\
  \ to concede the possibility. I determined, at once, standing in a puddle next to\
  \ the abandoned kiosk, to pay Mrs. Pyx a visit and interrogate her, under Klieg\
  \ lights if necessary. But then I realised that neither she nor her late husband\
  \ had ever revealed their whereabouts. Like Pointy Town itself, she was unmapp'd,\
  \ and I was lost.\n\nThis article was awarded one star\u2014Mavis Handbasin, Editrix-in-Chief\n\
