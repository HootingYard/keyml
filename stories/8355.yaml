text: "[My thanks to R.]\nThe lambing-hall boogie may refer to two distinct, yet allied,\
  \ phenomena. First we need to be clear what we mean by the lambing-hall. Almost\
  \ invariably, this is the farm building wherein newborn lambs are brought fumbling\
  \ and puling into the world. In the specific context of the lambing-hall boogie,\
  \ however, it refers to the site associated with the other extremity of the lamb's\
  \ life. Certain evil farmers mischievously give the name \u201Clambing hall\u201D\
  \ to the barn\u2014often cavernous, windowless, and grisly\u2014in to which lambs\
  \ are led to the slaughter. Those of you who have bathed in the blood of the lamb,\
  \ the better to become Christ-like, will be familiar with this latter designation,\
  \ as will those of you who have read Thomas Harris's potboiler The Silence Of The\
  \ Lambs, or have seen the film adaptation starring Jodie Foster as rookie FBI agent\
  \ Clarice Stalin.\nIncidentally, if I may digress for a moment, the agent's name\
  \ is often given, erroneously, as Clarice Starling. Even the potboilerist himself\
  \ refers to her as such throughout his text. Yet the parallels between the fictional\
  \ law enforcement officer and the non-fictional pock-marked moustachioed Georgian\
  \ petty thief who rose to become the paranoid and demented tyrant of the Soviet\
  \ Union are surely too obvious to need repetition here. For my part, I have gone\
  \ carefully through each page of my paperback copy of The Silence Of The Lambs,\
  \ Tippexing out the extraneous letters \u201Cr\u201D and \u201Cg\u201D in each mention\
  \ of Stalin, and then, using a black biro, slightly thickened the \u201Ca\u201D\
  \ and the \u201Cl\u201D to close the gap created between them. Laborious though\
  \ the process is, it makes for a much more satisfying read, for one is no longer\
  \ distracted by what seem to be frequent and irrelevant references to a starling,\
  \ the passerine bird known to congregate in vast flocks often numbering in the thousands,\
  \ or even millions. I was once reading the potboiler, as yet unmodified with Tippex,\
  \ when I paused to look out of my window and saw a flock of starlings in the sky,\
  \ blocking out the sun, but that is an anecdote for a later occasion.\nThe primary\
  \ definition of the lambing-hall boogie, then, is that it is the name given to a\
  \ riotous dance which may be organised by the evil farmer after he has cut the throats\
  \ of all the lambs he has corralled into the cavernous grisly barn. The sawdust\
  \ on the floor is awash with the blood of lambs, and into this gruesomeness the\
  \ evil farmer will inveigle his farmhands and their extended families. First they\
  \ roll about in the sawdust until they are smeared and splattered with lambs\u2019\
  \ blood, and then they dance. Perhaps the closest non-rustic equivalent of the dance\
  \ is the pogo once practised enthusiastically by punkists in the latter part of\
  \ the nineteen-seventies. But the music to which the farmpersons leap and hurl themselves\
  \ about the blood-soaked barn could not be more different from punk music as we\
  \ know it. Evil farmers are wont to employ for the evening a so-called chamber farm\
  \ orchestra, which performs a combination of baroque minuets and oompah marches,\
  \ overlaid, or possibly underlaid, I don't really understand the technicalities,\
  \ with funereal dirges on cello.\nIntriguingly, there is some evidence that Josef\
  \ Stalin may have taken part in several lambing-hall boogies during his youthful\
  \ years in Georgia. Clarice Stalin, however, did not, insofar as we can glean from\
  \ Harris's text. Further research on this matter is probably pointless, at least\
  \ in the case of the rookie FBI agent, for the simple reason that she is fictional.\n\
  The secondary definition of the lambing-hall boogie is, as I indicated, allied to\
  \ the first. If you have spent any appreciable time in a rustic milieu, you will\
  \ know that you can barely pass ten minutes without being buttonholed by a toothless\
  \ ancient or drooling village idiot eager to regale you with barely comprehensible\
  \ countryside lore and legend. Much of this can be airily dismissed with a wave\
  \ of your elegant hand, swathed in an Italianate silken glove, but occasionally\
  \ it pays to sit with the crone or idiot and to listen carefully. That is how I\
  \ learned of the undoubtedly real terrors of the other lambing-hall boogie, where\
  \ \u201Cboogie\u201D refers not to a dance but to a boogie-man or sprite or hobgoblin\
  \ or wraith or phantom or possibly even to the devil himself.\nThis figure, with\
  \ the head of a blood-soaked lamb and the body of either a goat or a hedgehog or\
  \ a starling, is said to appear from within an engulfing mist of foul and noisome\
  \ vapours on the stroke of midnight, when the pogoing farmpersons are sprawled,\
  \ exhausted and nauseous, on the bloody sawdust in the barn. It wreaks its terrible\
  \ vengeance by casting a hypnotic spell over all those gathered, condemning them\
  \ to a calendar year of rustic drudgery, flooded drainage ditches, pricking by thorns,\
  \ torrential rainfall, maddened cows, and other such miseries of countryside existence.\n\
  There is some conjecture that the lambing-hall boogie may have somehow entered the\
  \ body of, and commandeered the brain and soul of young Josef Stalin. There is further\
  \ conjecture that there exists a suppressed text by Thomas Harris in which Clarice\
  \ Stalin goes in pursuit of the lambing-hall boogie in an attempt to bring him to\
  \ justice. I have spoken to someone who claims to have seen the manuscript, who\
  \ reports that the potboilerist mires the whole business in unnecessary confusion.\
  \ In his version, the lambing-hall boogie, as it emerges from an engulfing mist\
  \ of foul and noisome vapours on the stroke of midnight, is erroneously given both\
  \ the head and the body of a starling, making it effectively identical to the bird\
  \ itself. My informant tells me that the bulk of the text then has Clarice Stalin\
  \ chasing a starling across the continental United States, armed with a butterfly\
  \ net.\n[2012-02-12]"
