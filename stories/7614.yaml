text: 'Many thanks to Salim Fadhley for drawing to my attention this whole flapdoodle
  about magnetically aligned cows. Personally, I have always been convinced of the
  unbreakable link between cows and magnetism, ever since an episode in a field during
  a picnic when I was a child. The memory grows dim, for I was but tiny, but magnets
  and cows were both involved, inextricably, I think. My father, too, and one of my
  sisters, and a priest who had joined us for the picnic, clad in his black soutane,
  but non-magnetic. If I could recall the exact date I could check the weather conditions
  pertaining at the time, if, that is, I could remember precisely where we were, at
  picnic, near cows, and magnets.
