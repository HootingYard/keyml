  This week my cupboard in The Dabbler contains an exclusive, and scintillating, review
  of my new paperback Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here
  Buckle! I wrote the review myself, so nobody else would have to. The best thing
  to do is to go and read it, and then make purchase of several copies of the book,
  wait for it to plop through your letterbox, then read the book itself, from cover
  to cover, repeatedly, until the unfathomable wisdom contained therein is drummed
  into your brain.
