  \ myself with the work of Honor Tracy. Here is a quick character sketch (of Desmond\
  \ Marjoribanks, editor of Torch, \u201Csome new dynamic weekly that's going to teach\
  \ us all how to live\u201D) from her novel A Number Of Things (1960):\n\u201CHe\
  \ was a man of about forty with a lofty brow made loftier by hastily retiring hair,\
  \ and the wide thin mouth, the nutcracker nose and chin that often go with large\
  \ progressive views: his light blue eyes positively glared with love of humanity,\
  \ his nostrils expanded and deflated with enthusiasm like those of a passionate\
  \ horse. He dearly loved resolutions, workers\u2019 councils, committees, monster\
  \ rallies, his children and his second wife. His first wife had thrown herself under\
  \ a train.\u201D\nHis downstairs neighbour, Orlando Figgis, has twin children named\
  \ Summerskill and Hallucination. I suspect I am going to enjoy this book.\n[2011-02-06]"
