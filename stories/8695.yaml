text: "Today is Saint Patrick's Day. Around the world, persons of Irish heritage\u2014\
  often extremely tenuous\u2014will find in the feast day an excuse to get drunk and\
  \ sing mawkish songs, and to generally engage in what they laughably call a craic.\
  \ I am of Irish heritage myself, on my father's side, but view the sentimental attachment\
  \ to the Emerald Isle with contempt, so instead of glugging Guinness and tunelessly\
  \ wailing \u201CO Danny Boy\u201D with tears coursing down my cheeks, I shall turn\
  \ my attention to ants.\nFor today we also celebrate the birthday of Horace St John\
  \ Kelly Donisthorpe (1870\u20131951), one of the greatest of British ant experts.\
  \ Independently wealthy, by dint of the family textile business in Leicestershire,\
  \ Donisthorpe went to the University of Heidelberg to study medicine, but left before\
  \ qualifying due to a \u201Ctoo sensitive nature\u201D. From the age of twenty,\
  \ he devoted the rest of his life to the study of ants and beetles.\n\nOver the\
  \ years, he hunted down ants in Aviemore, Chobham Common, Box Hill, Nethy Bridge,\
  \ Parkhurst Forest, Rannoch, the New Forest, Matley Bog, Sandown, and Weybridge\
  \ Heath, but his favourite stamping ground was Windsor Great Park, where he was\
  \ granted special permission to collect as many ants as he liked, and where many\
  \ of his discoveries were made. I ought not, perhaps, use the phrase \u201Cstamping\
  \ ground\u201D, as that summons a picture of Donisthorpe stamping his big boots\
  \ upon the ground, surely inadvisable in the circumstances. I have never collected\
  \ an ant in the wild myself, but I assume one must tread lightly and oh so carefully.\n\
  Donisthorpe was the author of over eight hundred books and papers, including British\
  \ ants, their life history and classification (1915), Myrmica schencki Emery, an\
  \ ant new to Britain (1915), Some notes on a paper by Dr. Leach on ants and gnats\
  \ in 1825 (1918), A list of ants from Mesopotamia; with a description of a new species\
  \ and a new variety (1918), Guests of British ants (1927), Descriptions of some\
  \ new species of ants (1931), On the identity of some ants from Ceylon described\
  \ by F. Walker (1932), On a small collection of ants made by Dr. F. W. Edwards in\
  \ Argentina (1933), Rhopalomastix janeti, a species of ant new to science (1936),\
  \ Five new species of ant, chiefly from New Guinea (1938), The genus Lioponera Mayr,\
  \ with descriptions of two new species and an ergatandromorph (1939), Descriptions\
  \ of several species of ants taken by Dr. O. W. Richards in British Guiana (1939),\
  \ The ants of Norfolk Island (1941), Descriptions of new ants from various localities\
  \ (1941), Description of a new species of Crematogaster Lund, subgenus Physocrema\
  \ Forel, with a list of, and a key to, the known species of the subgenus (1941),\
  \ Descriptions of a few ants from the Philippine Islands, and a male of Polyrhachis\
  \ bihamata Drury from India (1942), A myrmecophilous woodlouse (1943), Myrmecological\
  \ gleanings (1943), On a small collection of ants from West Africa, associated with\
  \ Coccidae (1945), Ireneopone gibber, a new genus and species of myrmicine ant from\
  \ Mauritius (1946), New species of ants from China and Mauritius (1947), Some new\
  \ ants from New Guinea (1947), A second instalment of the Ross Collection of ants\
  \ from New Guinea (1948), A third instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from\
  \ New Guinea (1948), A fourth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New\
  \ Guinea (1948), A fifth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea\
  \ (1948), A sixth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1949),\
  \ A seventh instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1949), An\
  \ eighth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1950), Two new\
  \ species of ants from Turkey (1950), and Two more new ants from Turkey (1950).\
  \ Rare indeed was the ant which eluded Donisthorpe's eagle eye.\nOne thing that\
  \ is clear from that (partial) list of his publications is Donisthorpe's enthusiasm\
  \ for new ants. This was to prove controversial, and he was considered to be \u201C\
  overeager\u201D to identify new species of ants. Indeed, of the thirty new species\
  \ he identified, twenty-four were subsequently deemed to be insufficiently distinct\
  \ to be considered separate species or to be synonymous with previous valid species.\
  \ An example of what we might call his pernickety attempts to identify wholly new\
  \ types of ant is his description of Polyrhachis hosei, where Donisthorpe admits\
  \ at the outset that \u201Cthe general description of P.(M.) byyani would do equally\
  \ well for this species\u201D. He then details a small number of very minor differences,\
  \ such as \u201Ca larger and more robust insect\u201D, \u201Cpronotal spines longer\u201D\
  , \u201Cthe scale has a somewhat wider arch\u201D, and so on.\nIndefatigable ant\
  \ collector that he was, Donisthorpe was fiercely protective of those he gathered\
  \ up, and would never allow them to mix with ants collected by others. The following\
  \ reminiscence, by R W Lloyd in a letter to the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine\
  \ in 1951, allows us a glimpse of the man, though unfortunately it concerns beetles\
  \ rather than ants:\nMr Donisthorpe was a very fine Coleopterist, but he had that\
  \ curious \u2018kink\u2019 shared by one or two other people, that he would only\
  \ put in his collection beetles he had taken with his own hands. Luckily for him\
  \ he was a man of leisure and he was able to go about the country when he heard\
  \ of any rare beetles being taken. It led, however, to some curious results, as\
  \ on a celebrated occasion when a collector in the New Forest got a very rare beetle\u2014\
  Velleius I believe it was\u2014and advised Mr Donisthorpe, who telegraphed him to\
  \ put a tumbler over it on the ground and keep it there until he was able to go\
  \ and collect it himself.\nWhen he was not collecting, cataloguing, peering at,\
  \ and writing about ants. Horace Donisthorpe liked to throw lavish and rambunctious\
  \ parties at his home in Kensington Mansions, and managed to dissipate much of his\
  \ fortune in doing so. Just as I shall not be celebrating Saint Patrick's Day in\
  \ carouse and revelry, nor will I paint the town red in memory of Donisthorpe. But\
  \ we should all remember him on this, his 142nd birthday. What better way to mark\
  \ it than to let him have the last word, in the form of one of the many, many notes\
  \ he contributed over the years to The Entomologist's Record & Journal Of Variation?\n\
  Homoptera devoured by a bird.\nAt a recent meeting of the Entomological Society\
  \ of London, my friend Mr. Eltringham gave an account of some attacks by birds on\
  \ Lepidoptera, and he said that all such occurrences should be put on record. This\
  \ no doubt holds good with other insects as well as Lepidoptera, hence the following\
  \ note.\nOn June 20th, 1927, at 6.30 a.m., I was looking out of my bedroom window\
  \ into the garden when I noticed a starling, which settled on a lavender bush, all\
  \ covered with \u201Ccuckoo-spits.\u201D It proceeded to\_deliberately pick out\
  \ from the froth all the larval Frog-hoppers, and eat them. I should think this\
  \ is not a very usual proceeding, as otherwise a flock of Starlings would clear\
  \ a garden in a very short time, and none of the insects be left. The late Dr. Sharp\
  \ did, I believe, say that the object of the froth was to attract a wasp, which\
  \ preyed on the Frog-hoppers! This, however, is not the view usually held by scientists.\n\
  Further reading and listening.\nMany of the ant-papers by Donisthorpe listed above\
  \ can be read online, following the links at the Global Ant Project.\nUntold thousands\
  \ of you may have been particularly eager to read this essay, under the misapprehension\
  \ that it would be devoted to Certain Ants, the legendary quartet of improv racket\
  \ makers of long ago. You will not be disappointed for long, because if you click\
  \ here you can listen to a vintage recording.\n[2012-03-17]"
