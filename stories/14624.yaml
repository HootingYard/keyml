text: "In the United States, during the 1950s, people often found Communists hiding\
  \ under their beds. That this was a common phenomenon is clear from the historical\
  \ record. There are numerous contemporary accounts, of which the following is a\
  \ typical example. It comes from a letter written to his local newspaper by a solid\
  \ citizen in one of the Midwestern states.\nOne day last week, just after turning\
  \ in for the night and settling down to sleep, I became aware of a rustling noise\
  \ under my bed. I was far too tired to get up, so, taking my torch from the bedside\
  \ table, I leaned right over and, with my head upside down, shone the torch under\
  \ the bed. I was startled to see, lying on the floor, an urbane and stylishly-dressed\
  \ man who had about him something of the air of an important State Department diplomat.\
  \ He was faffing about with bits of microfilm.\n\u201CWho the hell are you and what\
  \ are you doing hiding under my bed?\u201D I cried.\n\u201COh, good evening,\u201D\
  \ he replied, in the cultured voice of an East Coast Mandarin, \u201CI'm so sorry\
  \ to disturb you. Allow me to introduce myself. Hiss, Alger Hiss. This is a fine\
  \ piece of carpet, by the way, very comfortable.\u201D\nWhile he was saying this,\
  \ he was hurriedly stuffing the bits of microfilm into the pockets of his expensive\
  \ jacket to conceal them.\n\u201CI'm pleased you like my carpet,\u201D I said, \u201C\
  But you haven't explained what you are doing under my bed.\u201D\nAlger Hiss ignored\
  \ my question and took from an inside pocket of his expensive jacket a pamphlet,\
  \ which he thrust at me.\n\u201CI wonder if I might interest you in this pamphlet,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CIt gives a Marxist-Leninist perspective on the current crisis and\
  \ is well worth reading, should you wish to remove the imperialist blinkers from\
  \ your eyes.\u201D\n\u201CI'm not one for bookish learning,\u201D I said.\n\u201C\
  Well, it's a pamphlet rather than a book. Perhaps you could leave it on your bedside\
  \ table and pick it up later.\u201D\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D I said, but at that point\
  \ Alger Hiss unleashed upon me a strange bright-eyed gaze of fiendish Communist\
  \ hypnotic power, and I promptly fell into a deep, deep, and troubled sleep. When\
  \ I woke up, he was gone, and there was no sign he had ever been there, save for\
  \ the pamphlet on the bedside table, which I handed over to my local FBI agent for\
  \ analysis.\nAlthough we have many similar accounts, what has been lacking to date\
  \ is counter testimony from Communists themselves, explaining what they hoped to\
  \ achieve by hiding under beds. All the more welcome, then, is a new book by the\
  \ pseudonymous \u201CAgent X\u201D. It is entitled Why I Spent Much Of The 1950s\
  \ Hiding Under The Beds Of Solid Citizens, and is a rollicking good read, or at\
  \ least it would be were it not padded out with lengthy passages of indigestible\
  \ Marxist dialectic and incoherent socio-economic blathering. I have extracted the\
  \ key passage so you do not need to read the whole thing.\nI received instructions\
  \ from Yuri, my Moscow handler, that I was to be a \u201Csleeper\u201D. Unfortunately,\
  \ the microfilm bearing his message was damaged by pigeons, and it was not entirely\
  \ clear to me how I was to proceed. Sleeping seemed to be the gist of it, however,\
  \ and my faith in the Party was unshakeable, so I did not question how useful this\
  \ would be in fomenting the great proletarian revolution and bringing the hated\
  \ capitalist United States to its knees. Instead, I found a darkened room with a\
  \ bed in it and lay me down to sleep.\nBut something was not right, and I soon realised\
  \ what it was. The bourgeois comforts of mattresses and pillows and blankets were\
  \ a terrible distraction, classic techniques of the degenerate system to lull me\
  \ into false consciousness\u2014or, in this case, false unconsciousness. I eschewed\
  \ them, and lay down instead in the dark, on the floor, under the bed. Soon enough,\
  \ word got out among my fellow spies, and we were all at it. Happy days!\nSome of\
  \ these \u201Csleepers\u201D were so fanatical, and so devoted to the cause, that\
  \ a quarter of a century after the fall of the Soviet empire there are still thought\
  \ to be several Communists hiding under beds in the American Midwest. Solid citizens,\
  \ be on your guard!\n[2016-03-02]"
