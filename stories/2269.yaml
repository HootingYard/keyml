  \ this is superb! Mr Key's favourite beat combo, Henry Cow, performing \u201CLiving\
  \ In The Heart Of The Beast\u201D at Vevey in Switzerland in 1976. (It looks to\
  \ me as if they're in the middle of a field*, which may explain the absence of the\
  \ standard lamps which were such a beguiling feature of their usual stage set.)\
  \ Irritatingly split into three parts. Watch, listen, and learn.\nIncidentally,\
  \ \u201CLiving In The Heart Of The Beast\u201D was the piece that prompted Peter\
  \ Blegvad's dismissal from the Henry Cow / Slapp Happy collective on the grounds\
  \ of flippancy. Tim Hodgkinson wrote the music and, as Blegvad recalled in an interview\
  \ in Hearsay magazine, \u201CI was assigned the task for the collective to come\
  \ up with suitable verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing raisins\
  \ at a pile of bones. Tim just said, I'm sorry, this is not at all what we want.\
  \ And he wrote reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion and application\
  \ but it left me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual\u201D.\nWell, it is\
  \ a tirade, but it's still magnificent.\n*NOTE\_: This being Switzerland, I am reminded,\
  \ most appositely, of the timeless quotation\_\u201CHere we are in the field of\
  \ dreams, surrounded by fields of cows.\u201D See here for the source.\n\_\n[2009-04-14]"
