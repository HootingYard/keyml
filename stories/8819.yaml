text: "The pamphleteer Dobson had an id\xE9e fixe that anyone born on the first of\
  \ April needs must be a fool, and an incorrigible and irredeemable fool at that.\
  \ (It is pertinent to note that Dobson took great pains never to divulge his own\
  \ date of birth and seems to have destroyed all records of it.) Challenged to provide\
  \ evidence for his theory, Dobson embarked on the writing of a pamphlet. Putatively\
  \ entitled A Compendium Of Foolishness, its subtitle gives a succinct summary of\
  \ what we could have read had he ever written it: A Bumper Collection Of Anecdotes\
  \ Regarding Acts Of Foolishness Committed By Fools Born On All Fools Day. As far\
  \ as we know, he got no further than scribbling the title with his propelling pencil\
  \ on a sheet of notepaper, at which point he sat gazing out of the window for hours,\
  \ trying to think of appropriate tales of foolishness. Rummaging around in that\
  \ capacious pamphleteering brain, he drew a blank.\nDobson was reluctant to abandon\
  \ the project so soon, but felt unequal to conducting any research. He had only\
  \ recently recovered from an attack of the spraingue, had one arm in a sling, was\
  \ temporarily blind in one eye, and spent the best part of his waking hours with\
  \ his feet submerged in a bowl of jelly water. Such was my pitiable condition, he\
  \ wrote, That the very thought of conducting fool research risked a recurrence of\
  \ the spraingue. I was at my wits\u2019 end, and could only gaze out of the window\
  \ for hours on end in hopeless despair, munching cake.\nOne wet Thursday morning\
  \ during this period, Dobson was disturbed by a hammering at his door. He removed\
  \ his feet from the bowl, slipped on a pair of Argentinian Public Baths Attendants\u2019\
  \ pantoufles, and went to admit his visitor. It turned out to be the radio broadcaster\
  \ Gilbert Viperhead, the very man who had demanded, on air, that Dobson prove his\
  \ theory about fools. He was brandishing a horsewhip.\n\u201CYou, sir, are a scoundrel\
  \ and a cad!\u201D cried the radio host, \u201CAnd unless you provide me with conclusive\
  \ proof that those of us born on All Fools Day are fools, I shall give you a damned\
  \ good thrashing with this horsewhip I am brandishing!\u201D\n\u201CAs you can see,\u201D\
  \ replied Dobson, \u201CI am a sick man. Allow me time to recover from my recent\
  \ attack of the spraingue and I shall furnish you with so much evidence it will\
  \ be pouring out of your ears.\u201D\nIn spite of his florid face and the demeanour\
  \ of an enraged retired colonel, Viperhead was a reasonable man. He unbrandished\
  \ the horsewhip and accepted the cup of tea Dobson offered him. They spent an hour\
  \ in almost pleasant conversation, discoursing on topics such as the spraingue,\
  \ radio broadcasts, fools, jelly water, and horsewhips.\nBut when he had gone, Dobson\
  \ realised his dilemma. Sooner or later, he was going to have to justify his fool\
  \ theory, or remain in permanent convalescence. And then he had what was to prove\
  \ a fateful idea. He scurried back to his escritoire, took off the pantoufles, plunged\
  \ his feet back into the bowl, took his propelling pencil and some notepaper, and\
  \ started scribbling away.\nDear Cicely Courtneidge, he wrote, You were born on\
  \ the first of April and are therefore a fool. Please reply by return of post with\
  \ two or three anecdotes of incidents or episodes in your life which demonstrate\
  \ your utter foolishness. Yours sincerely, Dobson.\nHe stuffed this missive into\
  \ an envelope, scribbled Cicely Courtneidge's name and last known address on it,\
  \ sealed it, and affixed a stamp. He then wrote identical letters to Emperor Go-Saga\
  \ of Japan, William Harvey, John Wilmot, Otto von Bismarck, Ferruccio Busoni, Sergei\
  \ Rachmaninoff, Edgar Wallace, Lon Chaney Senior, Wallace Beery, Whittaker Chambers,\
  \ Lor Tok, Toshiro Mifune, Milan Kundera, Debbie Reynolds, Ali McGraw, Samuel R\
  \ Delany, Annie Nightingale, Ronnie Lane, David Gower, Susan Boyle, Philip Schofield,\
  \ and Dennis Kruppke. He would not need to track down anecdotes of foolery\u2014\
  the anecdotes would come to him! Dobson was not so foolish as to think that some\
  \ of his correspondents were still alive, but he hoped that, by cleverly pre-dating\
  \ some of his letters, their heirs might feel duty bound to reply. What he did not\
  \ take into account was the fact that some of the living recipients might take exception\
  \ to being called a fool by an obscure and penurious scribbler.\nSo it was that,\
  \ on a wet Wednesday morning shortly after shoving all these letters into the postbox\
  \ at the end of the lane, Dobson was disturbed by a hammering at his door. He removed\
  \ his feet from the bowl of jelly water, slipped on a pair of Peruvian bordello\
  \ keeper's pantoufles, and went to admit his visitor. It turned out to to be Jack\
  \ Hulbert, star of stage and screen and husband of Cicely Courtneidge. He was brandishing\
  \ a horsewhip.\n\u201CYou, sir, are a scoundrel and a cad!\u201D he cried, \u201C\
  How dare you insult my dear wife by calling her a fool? I am going to give you a\
  \ damned good thrashing with this horsewhip I am brandishing!\u201D\n\u201CAs you\
  \ can see,\u201D said Dobson, but before he could get another word out Jack Hulbert\
  \ began thrashing him with the horsewhip. The pamphleteer learned that day that\
  \ not all outraged gents are as amenable to reason and cups of tea as Gilbert Viperhead.\
  \ It was not the only visit he received that week that left him battered and bruised\
  \ and bewailing his own foolishness.\nHe never did write the pamphlet.\n[2012-04-01]"
