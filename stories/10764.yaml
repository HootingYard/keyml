text: "Dobson's diaries contain a huge number of undated entries. Over the past several\
  \ years, a team of indefatigable researchers has been busy attempting to pinpoint\
  \ specific dates where possible, in a project funded by an unfathomably secret organisation\
  \ possibly led by international woman of mystery Primrose Dent. The team's most\
  \ recent success was to deduce, from internal textual evidence, that the following\
  \ was written on the fifth of January 1958:\nAfter a breakfast of kippers, hare-brains\
  \ and jellied celery, I was all set to spend the day slumped at my escritoire, scribbling,\
  \ but my inamorata Marigold Chew had other ideas.\n\u201CWe must go on an outing!\u201D\
  \ she cried, frighteningly.\nWhen I asked why, she replied that we ought to celebrate,\
  \ by outing and picnic, the birthdays of Scarlatti, Zebulon Pike, Frederick Converse,\
  \ Herbert Bayard Swope, Yves Tanguy, Stella Gibbons, Wieland Wagner, Friedrich Durrenmatt,\
  \ W. D. Snodgrass, Walter Mondale, Umberto Eco, Raisa Gorbachova, Jan Leeming, Diane\
  \ Keaton, Linda Clare, and Joan Balawejder, while also commemorating the anniversary\
  \ of the deaths of Edward the Confessor, Catherine de Medici, Karl Alfred von Zittel,\
  \ Sir Ernest Shackleton, Amy Johnson, Charles Slee, and Mistinguett. When I said\
  \ that I had no idea who some of these people were, she announced that today was\
  \ also the anniversary of the Great Fire of Eindhoven, the discovery of X-rays,\
  \ and the foundation of the Nazi Party.\n\u201CSo let us pack our picnic hamper\
  \ and set off on a hike!\u201D she added.\nWhich is what we did. After the picnic\
  \ (cows, rain) we stopped in at the Museum of Ack-on-or-near-the-Vug. It was about\
  \ to close, due to the pomposity of the curator, but we had a few minutes in which\
  \ to look around. My eye was caught by an exhibit of indescribable gorgeousness.\
  \ Well, I say indescribable, but the pompous curator made a pretty good fist of\
  \ describing it on the card placed next to it, which I copied out in my jotting\
  \ pad with my propelling pencil:\nIt is 45 cm. in height, has a jewel-encrusted\
  \ crimplene base, ivory fluting, ruched silk underbelts, hectic trimmings, a delightful\
  \ milky-green ribbed spandole, villainous scraping marks, a gutta percha rim, opalescent\
  \ bison-head motifs, swivelling glutinous beads inlaid with serried gems, fleur-de-lys\
  \ hatching, precise web-and-tuck dufraiment, talc stipples, a riband nightside opening\
  \ on the velveteen casing, some rather brusque kaolin relief work, tiny cack-iron\
  \ clips, berry lagging, a splendid gilt Spode handle, and corky frets on the oversling.\n\
  It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Marigold Chew executed a quick\
  \ sketch in her jotting pad with her propelling pencil, but as we left the museum\
  \ a jackdaw swooped out of the sky and snatched that page of the jotter in its beak\
  \ and flew away, away, up into the overcast sky.\n[2013-01-05]"
