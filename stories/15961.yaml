text: "Trudging through the countryside the other day, I saw ahead of me a couple\
  \ of peasants, standing at the edge of a bog, deep in conversation. It is well-known\
  \ that the talk of peasants consists almost exclusively of rustic lore and wisdom\
  \ expressed in the form of age-old sayings and proverbs. Thus it was no surprise\
  \ to me when the snatch of their talk I overheard as I passed them by was one such\
  \ old saying. What was unexpected was that it was one I had never heard before.\n\
  \u201CA ghoul and his monkey are soon martyred,\u201D one peasant muttered, in the\
  \ lugubrious tones of peasants the world over. His companion said something in reply,\
  \ but the words were swept away on the wind, and I heard them not. I was trudging\
  \ at a pretty fair crack, so I was almost immediately out of earshot. I considered,\
  \ for a moment, turning about and interrogating the peasant regarding his utterance,\
  \ but I quickly dismissed the thought. Trying to wring sense out of a peasant is\
  \ almost always, as one might put it, a fool's errand.\nI was still thinking about\
  \ what I had overheard when I arrived home. Usually, proverbs and sayings express\
  \ a self-evident truth, what we might call common sense. A stitch in time saves\
  \ nine and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush are examples of such folk\
  \ wisdom, passed down through the generations. But\u2014I wondered\u2014is it equally\
  \ true that a ghoul and his monkey are soon martyred?\nAfter making a cup of ersatz\
  \ cocoa-style boiling beige water, I heaved down from the bookshelf the two fat\
  \ volumes of the fourth edition of Actes and Monuments of these Latter and Perillous\
  \ Days, Touching Matters of the Church (1583) by John Foxe, commonly known as Foxe's\
  \ Book of Martyrs. This is my indispensable guide whenever I contemplate martyrdom.\
  \ Admittedly, I do not do so very often, and I had to remove an encrustation of\
  \ dust and grime from both volumes, using my trusty rag. That done, I felt confident\
  \ that somewhere within the more than two thousand folio pages of Foxe's mighty\
  \ work I would find confirmation of martyred ghouls and monkeys.\nSeveral hours\
  \ later, my brow was furrowed, my eyes were bleary, and my once boiling beige cocoa-style\
  \ water was stone cold. I slammed shut volume one of the Book of Martyrs having\
  \ failed to discover a single reference to either a ghoul or a monkey. This was\
  \ most disconcerting. Before pressing on with the second hefty volume, I tried to\
  \ clear my head by practising Tranche Seven of Baxter's Head-Clearing Exercises.\
  \ Tranches Two and Five are usually most efficacious, in my experience, but a quick\
  \ rummage in the pantry revealed that I was fresh out of paper pastry cases. Also,\
  \ I remembered that I had loaned my milk stamps to Bruno, so Tranche Seven it would\
  \ have to be.\nHead semi-cleared, I reheated my drink over a gas-jet and slumped\
  \ back in my armchair with Volume Two. Damn and blast John Foxe!, I shouted to the\
  \ ceiling at dusk, as the shades of night gathered in the dimpled and disgusting\
  \ sky, for I had fought my way through another thousand pages with neither hide\
  \ nor hair of a ghoul or a monkey coming to light. It was at this point that I first\
  \ began to doubt the veracity of that peasant I had overheard, so many hours ago.\
  \ Surely, if a ghoul and his monkey were soon martyred, or indeed martyred at all,\
  \ sooner or later, then they could not have escaped John Foxe's notice? And yet\
  \ they had.\nI slept uneasily, but awoke in the morning with a renewed sense of\
  \ purpose. A question thumped and rethumped in my head. Could I infer from the proverb\
  \ that every ghoul had his own monkey? That no ghoul was, as it were, monkeyless?\
  \ Or did the saying simply point out that those ghouls who did have monkeys were\
  \ soon martyred, along with their monkeys? Were there ghouls without monkeys who\
  \ were immune from martyrdom? I could have lain in bed all day, letting these conundra,\
  \ if that is a word, swirl around in my head. But if I did so I would be as mad\
  \ as a pedal bin full of guinea pigs by lunchtime, so I leapt out of bed, cut three\
  \ or four Boswellian capers around the room, and, after abluting and tucking into\
  \ what our Flemish pals call het ontbijt, I went to the nearest zoo.\nMy theory\
  \ was that I would find evidence of ghouls in or around the Monkey House. If I was\
  \ lucky, I might even find a ghoul and a monkey together, perhaps being subjected\
  \ to a hideous and barbaric execution, burned at a stake for example. This was not\
  \ likely, however. I suspected that any diligent zookeeper\u2014and are there any\
  \ other kind?\u2014would put a stop to such shenanigans. No, the martyrdom of a\
  \ ghoul and his monkey would never take place in a well-regulated zoo. They would\
  \ be dragged away by their persecutors, to a gibbet atop a tor silhouetted against\
  \ an awful sky, say, or to a dungeon beneath a temple fort. What, then, could I\
  \ hope to discover at the zoo?\nTo answer this niggling question, I turned, as I\
  \ so often do, to Arthur Ira Garfunkel. Half a century ago, the G, as he is known\
  \ to his close friends, had sung about being at a zoo. If I could only remember\
  \ the words, I felt sure they would guide me. I tried to summon the song in my head,\
  \ but though I recalled mentions of monkeys, giraffes, and hamsters\u2014hamsters?\u2014\
  there was not a single ghoul. This flummoxed me, until a passing zookeeper, hearing\
  \ my humming, pointed out that somebody else had written the words. The G was just\
  \ singing them\u2014they were not pure authentic Garfunkelisms. I was crushed, and\
  \ all the more so when the same zookeeper told me that, it being Thursday, the Monkey\
  \ House was padlocked shut. It was the monkeys\u2019 day off, he explained. He plodded\
  \ away, thin, undead, and spectral, clanking his chains and groaning. I went home.\n\
  After taking an uneasy nap, I sat up and reviewed the situation, Thus far, my research\
  \ had focused on martyrs and monkeys. Yet the proverb clearly placed ghouls at the\
  \ forefront. I was working backwards! I plunged my head into a basin of ice-cold\
  \ water (Tranche Four), tossed some ectoplasm into my pippy bag, hoicked it over\
  \ my shoulder, and pranced out of the door, affecting a determined jut of the jaw\
  \ as if I were the actor Bernard Lee in The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949). Pausing\
  \ at the corner to belatedly tie my shoelaces, I headed straight for my local branch\
  \ of Ghouls R Us.\nOnce inside, I went up to the counter and rang the bell. Its\
  \ peal was funereal and redolent of death, bats, and sepulchres. I waited for several\
  \ minutes until, from behind a veil of cobwebs, a sales assistant appeared. I was\
  \ immediately struck by how close a resemblance he bore to the zookeeper I had met\
  \ that morning. He was thin and undead and spectral, clanking his chains and groaning.\
  \ I was about to ask him if he had a brother working at the zoo, but I stopped myself.\
  \ I had devised a clever plan, and I must stick to it. Watching him closely, alert\
  \ to the faintest of reactions, I said:\n\u201CGood afternoon. Do you have any monkeys\
  \ for rental?\u201D\nThe flesh of his eyelids had rotted away, but was that the\
  \ ghost trace of a blink? His lips, too, had long ago been eaten by worms, but did\
  \ I discern the shadow of trembling? So foul was his countenance I could not be\
  \ sure. Then he spoke, and his voice came as if from a deep and desolate tomb a\
  \ thousand miles distant.\n\u201CNo,\u201D he said, and it was all he said, and\
  \ then, before my eyes, he crumbled to dust, leaving only a cloud of vapour hovering\
  \ in the mephitic air. I turned on my heel and ran all the way home, gibbering.\n\
  I woke bright and early the next morning. While shovelling het ontbijt down my gob,\
  \ I heard the whistling of the postie. He was an embittered postie\u2014how to explain\
  \ his cheerful whistle? Perhaps I ought to devote the day to solving that little\
  \ puzzle. It would take my mind off ghouls and monkeys and martyrdom.\nAmong the\
  \ bills and flyers and religious tracts in the day's delivery, I was delighted to\
  \ find the latest edition of the Reader's Digest. Having made my usual check to\
  \ ensure the apostrophe in the title was correctly placed, obviating the need to\
  \ write a letter of complaint to the editor, I browsed the contents page. I looked\
  \ forward to reading \u201CI Am John's Head\u201D and \u201CFighting The Communist\
  \ Menace\u201D, among other articles. And if I had the time, I would skim through\
  \ a piece entitled \u201CWhen Peasants Mutter, How Easy It Is To Mishear Their Wise\
  \ Old Sayings!\u201D\nPlacing the magazine on my windowsill magazine placement contraption,\
  \ I looked out and saw, on the village green, they were erecting the gibbet for\
  \ that afternoon's simian zombie heretic hangings.\n[2017-11-27]"
