text: "My mother had a tin ear and a voice like a corncrake. In spite of these shortcomings,\
  \ she saw it as her maternal duty to teach me a number of songs. I do not think\
  \ she hoped that one day I might have bouquets thrown at me as I took a bow upon\
  \ the opera house stage, it was merely that she felt the ability to sing songs was\
  \ a necessary social accomplishment, like having good table manners or making small\
  \ talk with riffraff.\nIt was on the day after my sixth birthday that Ma announced\
  \ her intention. I was happily sprawled on the floor playing with a stick and a\
  \ lump of coal when she swished into my nursery through the butchers\u2019 drapes,\
  \ grabbed me by the wrist, and hauled me off to what she henceforth called \u201C\
  the music room\u201D. This was actually one of the pantries in which she had cleared\
  \ space for her spinet.\nShe began, inappropriately, by teaching me the Four Last\
  \ Songs of Richard Strauss. These were quite a challenge for a six-year-old who\
  \ spoke no German and was accompanied, not by an orchestra, but by a cack-handedly\
  \ tinkled spinet, and much aggression.\n\u201CFor Christ's sake, Arpad!\u201D, Ma\
  \ would shout, \u201CTry harder or I will set the Grunty Man on you!\u201D\nThe\
  \ precise nature of the Grunty Man had never been explained to me, but, like all\
  \ six-year-olds, I was terrified of him. Ma did let slip that his awful rages could\
  \ be soothed by song, and I believed her. Indeed, I still do, so many years later.\
  \ Ma has long been in her grave, and her little Arpad has grown old and frail, but\
  \ I never crawl into my bed at night without putting out a saucer of suet and marzipan\
  \ to placate the Grunty Man should he smash his way into my chalet as midnight strikes.\
  \ When he removes the treats from the saucer, the pressure knob concealed beneath\
  \ it will click up and activate a gramophone player, and the fearsome creature will\
  \ be lulled by the dulcet tones of Dame Nellie Melba crackling from a 78.\nWhen\
  \ I had mastered the Four Last Songs to Ma's satisfaction, we moved on to Dr Bogenbroom.\
  \ This is a 1971 song by Jethro Tull, not one of their better-known pieces, and\
  \ one which, curiously, I found far harder to learn than the Strauss. Much of the\
  \ difficulty was due to the fact that Ma was now accompanying me on a wheezy and\
  \ motheaten sackbut, an instrument with which she showed even less proficiency than\
  \ the spinet. Our family factotum, Mungo, of Carpathian peasant stock, had grown\
  \ fearful of the sound of the spinet after a series of nightmares, and had thrown\
  \ it down a well. Ma resolved to change the locks on all the pantry doors, and to\
  \ banish Mungo to the garden. He made himself a yurt as shelter against the snow,\
  \ for this was a time of great howling blizzards. In the evenings, from my nursery\
  \ window, I would hear Mungo singing away. He had a deep and booming voice and sang\
  \ the Carpathian ditties remembered from his childhood, but Ma said they were abominations\
  \ and nailed fast the shutters on my windows. Thereafter the silence was broken\
  \ only by my own relentless practising, over and over again, of Dr Bogenbroom. It\
  \ took me many months to crack it, but I did. As a reward, Ma gave me a new lump\
  \ of coal to play with. The other one had crumbled, so I had been tapping my stick\
  \ upon the floor, or upon the shell of Mungo's tortoise.\nI did not have much playtime,\
  \ though, because Ma insisted I next learn Essay On Pigs by Hans Werner Henze. Difficult,\
  \ brutal, and shouty, these five settings of the poem by Gast\xF3n Salvatore suited\
  \ me perfectly, and in a matter of days I had them down pat. In fact I learned them\
  \ before Mungo had finished repairing the spinet. Ma had pushed him down the well\
  \ and made him fetch the various broken fragments, then locked him in a linen cupboard\
  \ with a hammer and pliers and nails until he put the instrument back in one piece.\
  \ She hated the sackbut, as did I, and we both looked forward to the day she could\
  \ bash out her witlessly-arranged accompaniments upon the spinet once more. But\
  \ Mungo was a slow worker, and almost a year passed before he was done. During this\
  \ time, it was my job to feed his tortoise, and I became very familiar with curly\
  \ kale and lettuce, to my immeasurable benefit in later life.\nI fear I must pass\
  \ in silence over the next stage in my song-singing education, for it is too painful\
  \ to recollect. Ma somehow got it into her head to teach me Drink Ye Every One The\
  \ Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take You Away, the single\u2014and\
  \ singular\u2014song written by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson. I learned it.\
  \ I sang it. I can still sing it. But it gives me no pleasure to do so, and it frightens\
  \ even the crickets in my hearth. I will write about them separately, by the way.\n\
  Her spinet now restored, Ma's pedagogic impulses were a-buzz. By the time St Bibblybibdib's\
  \ Day swung round, she had taught me Che gelida manina, Roll Along Covered Wagon,\
  \ all one hundred and fourteen songs in the collection published by Charles Ives\
  \ in 1922, and The Light Pours Out Of Me by Magazine. Keen as I was to crack right\
  \ on, it was on the eve of my patron saint's day that I was felled by an ague. I\
  \ lost the use of my limbs, was rendered half-blind, and could only croak pitifully.\
  \ Now, Ma had no truck with the medical profession, relying instead on Mungo's befuddled\
  \ and, I suspect, inaccurate memories of Carpathian peasant nostrums. Most if not\
  \ all of these seemed to involve gunk and fluid drained from the gall bladder of\
  \ his tortoise, and the chanting of gibberish at my bedside. I cannot say if, or\
  \ how, it contributed to my recovery from the ague, but the chanting certainly had\
  \ a profound effect on Ma. I have said she had a voice like a corncrake; now she\
  \ began to behave like one. After listening, rapt, to Mungo, she would lollop off\
  \ across the fields to the edge of Scroonhoonpooge farm, and hide in the wheat,\
  \ gobbling down insects and seeds and shoots and frogs. As I got better, and my\
  \ sight returned, I noted that when sitting at my bedside she was furiously knitting\
  \ herself a pair of woollen wings.\nBy the time of my seventh birthday I was fit\
  \ as a fiddle. I jumped out of bed and scampered to the pantry, keen to begin work\
  \ on The Song Of Investment Capital Overseas by the Art Bears and More Than A Feeling\
  \ by Boston. Ma had given me to understand that these two songs would complete my\
  \ repertoire, and with them under my belt I would never be at a loss to entertain\
  \ sophisticated people at cocktail parties for the rest of my life. But when I pushed\
  \ open the pantry door I was met with a sight so traumatic that it meant I would\
  \ never become the sort of person, with easy manners and social dash, who receives\
  \ invitations to cocktail parties. Mungo was keening his deafening Carpathian peasant\
  \ chant, and applying a poultice made from his tortoise's gall bladder goo to Ma,\
  \ who was encased from head to toe in a corncrake suit made of wool. She, in her\
  \ turn, was calling \u201Ccrex! crex! crex!\u201D over and over again. Of the spinet,\
  \ there was no sign.\nI never did learn to sing those two songs. Over the following\
  \ year, Ma tried all in her power to turn me into a corncrake chick. I was forbidden\
  \ to sing anything at all, even the Essay On Pigs, my stick and my lump of coal\
  \ were cast into a dustbin, and my time was split between hiding in the wheat and\
  \ being chanted at by Mungo in the pantry.\nGod knows what would have happened had\
  \ fate not intervened. Shortly before my eighth birthday, Mungo was called up by\
  \ the Carpathian peasant army reserve, and returned to his homeland. We waved him\
  \ off from the station. He left his tortoise with me for safekeeping. It lives with\
  \ me still, and I feed it on curly kale and lettuce, but I have never drained a\
  \ drop of fluid from its gall bladder. Ma eventually came to her senses and shed\
  \ her corncrake ways, but she never taught me any more songs.\n[2009-11-18]"
