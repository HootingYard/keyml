text: "The title of Dobson's A Short Essay Upon Cardboard Breakfast Cereal Packets\
  \ leads the reader, not unreasonably, to expect an essay upon the subject of cardboard\
  \ breakfast cereal packets. It is nothing of the sort. Such a topic was, it need\
  \ hardly be said, grist to the pamphleteer's mill, for nothing cardboard was alien\
  \ to him. But we should recall that he had already dealt with cardboard breakfast\
  \ cereal packets, exhaustively, in his pamphlet Nothing Cardboard Is Alien To Me\
  \ (out of print), as well as in several other works.\nA Short Essay Upon Cardboard\
  \ Breakfast Cereal Packets is, in fact, a hand-written and unpublished screed scratched\
  \ out by Dobson with a butcher's pencil upon cut or torn sheets of cardboard, once\
  \ forming parts of breakfast cereal packets, composed during a paper shortage. The\
  \ historical evidence for this paper shortage is slight, even non-existent, and\
  \ it may be that it occurred only inside the pamphleteer's head. He is known to\
  \ have imagined crises of various kinds, such as outbreaks of ergot poisoning, bird\
  \ attacks, planetary collisions and thunderstorms, none of which actually took place\
  \ but fantastic details of which he scribbled down in his journals alongside the\
  \ mundane and tiresome. Marigold Chew suggested Dobson did this to make his life\
  \ seem more exciting and to provide any future biographers with opportunities for\
  \ hysteria-heightened prose. If that is the case, it must be said that an invented\
  \ paper shortage is hardly the stuff of high drama. Tousle-haired young Dobsonist\
  \ Ted Cack has suggested that the pamphleteer simply ran out of paper one day and\
  \ could not be bothered to fetch a fresh supply from the stationer's.\nWhether his\
  \ recourse to bits of cardboard was genuinely necessary or otherwise, the Short\
  \ Essay is an intriguing piece of work, chiefly because it remained in manuscript\
  \ and was never typeset and turned into a pamphlet proper. Dobson perhaps felt it\
  \ was too short, although at other times he happily issued for publication, in pamphlet\
  \ form, some remarkably brief works, not the least of which was the famous and much-anthologised\
  \ Paragraph About Potatoes, for many of us our introduction to the titanic pamphleteer.\n\
  Ted Cack's view, expounded in an incoherent and shouty way during his hour upon\
  \ the fourth plinth when he took part in Gormless Gormley's ludicrous pageant of\
  \ inanity in Trafalgar Square, is that Dobson planned to incorporate the Short Essay,\
  \ unaltered and in its entirety, into a longer piece, a study of the behaviour of\
  \ toads in the Soviet Union, which, despite voluminous notes, a research trip to\
  \ Omsk, and the purchase of a fur cap with ear-flaps, he never actually completed.\
  \ It is difficult to know what to make of young Ted Cack's argument, for the words\
  \ toad, behaviour, Soviet and Union are nowhere present in A Short Essay Upon Cardboard\
  \ Breakfast Cereal Packets. Where, and to what purpose, we are entitled to ask,\
  \ did the out of print pamphleteer intend to insert this fragment of prose, barely\
  \ sixty words long, into a piece which, the extant drafts tell us, was single-mindedly\
  \ concentrated, with laser-beam precision, upon communist Bufonidae?\nAn additional\
  \ curiosity about the Short Essay is that the cardboard sheets were at some point\
  \ coated with a kind of disgusting yet transparent paste which makes them resistant\
  \ to all known photocopying techniques. Now there's a thing.\nFurther Reading\_\
