text: "Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go. We work at the sludge-banks. We monitor\
  \ and count and then extract from the sludge the flies and gnats and bluebottles\
  \ and other insects which have flown thwack! straight into the sludge, and become\
  \ stuck, and died. There is something about the winds hereabouts, in their sweep\
  \ and turbulence, that impels the tiny creatures towards the sludge. And once they\
  \ are near, they are attracted by the pong rising from the sludge, the stink of\
  \ corruption and rot and death. The sludge-banks lie at the edge of a vast lake\
  \ bordering the estuary.\nWe do not actually sing the song of the seven dwarves\
  \ when we go to work. First, we are none of us little folk, and second, we know\
  \ only too well the ruthless and ruinous energy of the Disney Corporation's legal\
  \ fiends. We witnessed the suicide, by bleach, blade and plunge, of a colleague\
  \ who was pursued through the courts relentlessly for having named his duck D\u2014\
  -d. So when we go off to work at the sludge-banks we do not risk singing that jaunty\
  \ song, much as we would like to, and much as it would suit us to do so, despite\
  \ our not being of the diminutive persuasion.\nInstead we sing the sludge-banks\
  \ song. What it lacks in dwarvish jauntiness it gains in intellectual heft. The\
  \ tune we borrowed from Charles Ives, a startling passage from the third movement\
  \ of the Piano Trio. For the words, we collaborated, during a weekend workshop in\
  \ a wigwam in the woods. We smoked pipes and drank copious draughts of undistilled\
  \ nettlewater, and as soon as we had finished a verse we danced around a bonfire\
  \ before resuming our lyrical labours. Or, rather say, we hopped and flailed around\
  \ a bonfire. There are twenty-six verses in the sludge-banks song.\nI shall not\
  \ tell you a single word of any of them, for we have taken a leaf out of the Disney\
  \ Corporation's book, and we shall wreak a terrible vengeance on any who pirate\
  \ or copy or duplicate or cause to be babbled or you-know-what the words of our\
  \ work song. Hi ho, hi ho.\n[2009-03-14]"
