text: "In spite of its spelling, the word \u201Cfogou\u201D is pronounced not, as\
  \ we might expect, fog-ooh, but foo-goo. This helps to differentiate it from the\
  \ exclamation one might make were one to find oneself suddenly engulfed in a peasouper.\
  \ \u201CFogou\u201D was brought to my attention by reader Rob Howard, who suggests\
  \ that the word surely exists for the sole purpose of being spoken aloud by Mr Key\
  \ on his radio show. Mr Howard may have a point. Of course, when the time comes\
  \ for me to read this present essay on Hooting Yard On The Air, the existence of\
  \ the word will at last be justified, much as Dennis Hopper's bombs in the film\
  \ Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994) achieve their purpose when they explode. I will have\
  \ to say \u201Cfog-ooh\u201D, too, but listeners should not interpret this as an\
  \ indication that the ResonanceFM studio has become enswathed in a chill and spooky\
  \ mist. If that eventuality does indeed occur, by dint of the mysteries of coincidence\
  \ and synchronicity, I will endeavour to make that absolutely clear to listeners.\n\
  And there the matter might rest, save for the fact that your curiosity has been\
  \ whetted and you probably want to know, now, what \u201Cfogou\u201D means. Some\
  \ of you may already have jumped to the conclusion that \u201Cfogou\u201D is what\
  \ you say when you are listening to a piece of classical music and suddenly realise\
  \ it is \u201Ca polyphonic composition constructed on one or more short subjects\
  \ or themes, which are harmonized according to the laws of counterpoint, and introduced\
  \ from time to time with various contrapuntal devices\u201D (Stainer and Barrett),\
  \ but you would be wrong, wrong, wrong.\nPack up an overnight bag and go to Cornwall.\
  \ Plot your journey on a map and arrange to visit Halliggye on the Trelowarren estate\
  \ near Garras, Carn Euny, Boleigh near Lamorna, Pendeen, Trewardreva near Constantine,\
  \ which is known locally as Pixie's Hall or Piskey Hall, Chysauster, Boden Vean\
  \ near Manaccan, Lower Boscaswell, Porthmeor, Higher Bodinar, Castallack, Treveneague,\
  \ and Penhale Round. In each of these places you will find one of the fogous which\
  \ have thus far been discovered by the types of people who go searching for fogous,\
  \ or evidence thereof.\nIf, having done as you were told in the previous paragraph,\
  \ you still don't know what a fogou is, God help you. Actually, that is somewhat\
  \ harsh. I should try to be a kinder Mr Key. So, though I am not God, I will help\
  \ you.\nA fogou is an underground, dry-stone structure found on Iron Age or Romano-British\
  \ defended settlement sites in Cornwall. Similar structures have been found elsewhere,\
  \ particularly in the Orkney Islands, where there is a fogou at Castle Bloody on\
  \ Shapinsay. Quite why our ancestors built them is a matter of conjecture. They\
  \ may have been used for magic rituals, or they may have been used for the storage\
  \ of gulls\u2019 eggs. There may have been magic rituals calling for the use of\
  \ gulls\u2019 eggs, possibly, which would kill two conjectures with one stone. I\
  \ was going to say \u201Ckill two birds\u201D, as the saying is, but having just\
  \ mentioned gulls, twice, or more precisely their eggs, also twice, and the gull\
  \ being a type of bird, I did not want to tie myself in verbal knots. Come to think\
  \ of it, a knot is also a type of bird, so that little \u201Ckilling two conjectures\u201D\
  \ sally didn't get me very far. And the knots get even more entangled when we consider\
  \ that, whether it is birds, gulls or knots, or conjectures we are killing with\
  \ one stone, one of the discoveries that has been made in the remains of fogous\
  \ is of large stone balls, or petrospheres, possible symbols of power within prehistoric\
  \ society, and thus connected perhaps to ritual magic, whether or not that magic\
  \ depended on the use of gulls\u2019 eggs.\nIt is all a bit of a muddle in my head,\
  \ to be honest. But now you know what a fogou is, and you can go looking for them,\
  \ in Cornwall, or in the Orkneys, should that be your bag, daddy-o.\n[2012-01-05]"
