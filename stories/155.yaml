text: "\u201CIn a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Dr Conolly, of the Hanwell\
  \ Lunatic Asylum, speaking of the moral treatment of the insane, stated as the result\
  \ of the experience of his whole life, that distorted views on religious subjects\
  \ are the cause of at least two-thirds of the cases of mania in ladies, especially\
  \ those belonging to the upper classes. Touching with all reverence on the proper\
  \ study of religious books, Dr Conolly lamented that morbid brooding over subjects\
  \ of theology and points of doctrine is such a fruitful cause of mental diseases\u2026\
  \ Although Dr Conolly's remarks pointed generally to the impropriety and danger\
  \ of persons\u2014ladies especially\u2014abandoning themselves to self-guidance,\
  \ and over-prolonged contemplation on subjects of religious controversy, he severely\
  \ commented upon the injurious effects of those poisonous literary emanations appearing\
  \ without authority, and dignified most improperly by the name of \u2018religious\u2019\
  .\u201D\nI have to say that some of the greatest pleasures of my life have been\
  \ found in morbid brooding about abstruse points of theological doctrine. Still,\
  \ now I know better, don't I? The quoted passage is from Things Not Generally Known\
  \ by John Timbs (1858), where you can also read about such matters as insensibility\
  \ of the brain, dread of eclipses, unpopular improvements, and the Death of the\
  \ Beetle and the Giant. Clearly a work which had a profound influence on the out\
  \ of print pamphleteer Dobson.\nThanks to Scribal Terror.\n[2007-05-15]"
