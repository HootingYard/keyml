text: "Like so many of Isaac's attempts to apply his imaginative vision to life, this\
  \ orgone box was compromised by his poverty and his many interests. It was too obviously\
  \ a homemade, bargain-basement orgone box. It looked more like a cardboard closet\
  \ or stage telephone booth than it did a scientific apparatus by which to recover\
  \ the sexual energy one had lost to \u201Cculture\u201D. Isaac's orgone box stood\
  \ up in the midst of an enormous confusion of bed clothes, review copies, manuscripts,\
  \ children, and the many people who went in and out of the room as if it were the\
  \ bathroom. Belligerently sitting inside his orgone box, daring philistines to laugh,\
  \ Isaac nevertheless looked lost, as if he were waiting in his telephone booth for\
  \ a call that was not coming through.\nAlfred Kazin on Isaac Rosenfeld, quoted in\
  \ Adventures In The Orgasmatron\_: Wilhelm Reich And The Invention Of Sex by Christopher\
  \ Turner (2011)\n\n[2013-04-09]"
