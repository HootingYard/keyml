  \ of you who carry about hand-held computerised devices. I eschew such newfangled\
  \ gewgaws myself, but that is no reason to miss the opportunity to make my fortune.\
  \ If millions, or indeed billions of fatheads buy one of my apps, I shall not be\
  \ complaining.\nOne app I forgot to mention in the piece is the iPadde, named after\
  \ Knud Padde, a minor character in the Danish television crime drama Forbrydelsen.\
  \ This handy app does instant translations into Danish of common phrases such as\
  \ \u201Ccomputer password fuckup\u201D and \u201Cgirl power wet tee-shirt competition\u201D\
