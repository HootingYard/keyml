text: "Allah-befuddled theocratic nutters and their chums in the airhead wing of what\
  \ used to be the \u201Cleft\u201D are fond of referring to the state of Israel as\
  \ \u201Cthe Zionist Entity\u201D. This is of course a pejorative term, not only\
  \ denying the legitimacy of the state but implying that there is something menacing\
  \ and eldritch about it, like a tentacled Lovecraftian abomination.\nSo much for\
  \ the global body politic. What about the bosky winding lanes of Interwebshire?\
  \ Your favourite website, the one that makes you drool with joy unparalleled, nestles\
  \ there, attracting a modicum of attention. But no one gets het up into a bothersome\
  \ lather about Hooting Yard, do they? They bash on the gates, come in and read,\
  \ perhaps leave a comment or buy a book or make a donation or subscribe, and then\
  \ they tootle off again, heading for the Lord knows what sink of iniquity or wittering\
  \ or poppycock. In nation-state terms, then, Hooting Yard is an obscure and seldom-crowed-about\
  \ country, akin to Andorra, perhaps, or Kiribati, or Palau. If the nutters drove\
  \ us into the sea, would anybody even notice?\nIn a no doubt foolhardy attempt to\
  \ raise our profile, and indeed to have other websites quaking in their boots at\
  \ our (albeit imaginary) menacing Lovecraftian tentacles, the time has come to rename\
  \ ourselves as The Hooting Yard Entity. You have been warned.\n[2011-03-29]"
