text: "\n\u201CThursday,\u201D he wrote in his journal, \u201CI could not stomach\
  \ breakfast. Minnie reproached me. She has been hiding my socks again, God blast\
  \ her! Today I found them in the coal-shed, after an hour's search. An hour I could\
  \ have better spent mulling over Bewg's latest clue, which seems to be utterly without\
  \ meaning. I spent much of the morning polishing off my paper on musketry. The post\
  \ brought an anonymous letter, accusing me of having joined the scientifico-medical\
  \ club by dint of intrigue, and threatening exposure unless I paid an unwarrantable\
  \ sum of money into a secret bank account. I tore the letter to shreds in fury.\
  \ Exposure? Intrigue? Dint?\n\u201CAfter lunch, as I was about to settle to some\
  \ serious Bewg-related musings, I was further distracted by a visit from Chodd.\
  \ Apparently, I was meant to have completed by today the design for the new Electro-Magnetic\
  \ Apparatus Museum tickets. The opening is next month and before then the Committee\
  \ has to approve my design and get billions of the confounded things printed. I\
  \ admitted to Chodd that this task had completely slipped my mind. I do not know\
  \ why on earth I was asked to do it. To show willing, I fetched from the crate in\
  \ the goose-shed my Simplified Ticket Design Handbook, and also dug out a few rough\
  \ sketches I had made last time I designed some tickets (for the Small Zoo Railway)\
  \ about forty years ago.\n\u201CChodd was contemptuous. His small flat ears, which\
  \ poke out from his head at a grotesque angle, turned purple with irritability.\
  \ I badgered him for information. What size should the tickets be? How many colours\
  \ were permissible? Would the tickets be perforated and torn from a large sheet,\
  \ or pre-snipped? What fonts were available? I realised I should have sought all\
  \ this information earlier, and Chodd realised it too, and used my ignorance against\
  \ me, spitting into my mahogany spittoon with undisguised venom. When eventually\
  \ I had sketched a design which I thought perfectly adequate\n\n\u201CChodd had\
  \ the nerve to insist that a separate design was necessary for the reduced-rate\
  \ entry fee for children. Bah! Children! What do they care for Electro-Magnetism?\
  \ It was my turn to spit, but I did as I was bid.\n\n\u201CThat shut him up! Roughly,\
  \ I thrust the designs into his limp and puny hands and shooed him from the house.\
  \ If the Committee did not accept my tickets, I raved, as he retreated out of the\
  \ door, then they were no better than bed-wetters, and woe betide them if they were\
  \ to ask me to revise my brilliant designs, into which I had poured every last scintilla\
  \ of my genius. Chodd muttered something which I did not hear, and trudged off into\
  \ the downpour. If he visits me again, I shall set a pack of starving sharp-fanged\
  \ beasts upon him.\n\u201CChodd dispatched, I attempted to annihilate the image\
  \ of him from my brain by undertaking some long overdue chores. I smeared wax on\
  \ to the little spindle under the netting. I counted toads. I pressed my hair underneath\
  \ a steaming slab. Minnie's cocoa-tin needed a lick of paint. I re-counted the toads.\
  \ There were far more of them than I had realised, and they came in many different\
  \ shades and sizes. I suspected that some of them were not toads at all, and as\
  \ luck would have it, the reference book I duly consulted in order to settle the\
  \ matter quite fortuitously led me to decipher the next clue in Bewg's trail, by\
  \ an unfathomable concatenation of fireworks in my head, one of those tremendous\
  \ mental jamborees which seem to occur more and more frequently the older I get,\
  \ a fact which I have discussed at length with that fraudulent old buzzard Pillchain,\
  \ who lives in the apartment below, and whose pretensions as a psychoanalyst cause\
  \ me greater mirth than almost anything else in these twilight years of my life,\
  \ beset as I am by creaking bones, indigestion, vipers like Chodd, Minnie's manias,\
  \ agonising pains which rack my every limb, the fiend Bewg, intermittent lockjaw,\
  \ the gas bills, the cold and damp, and that peculiarly Finnish synkkys, tenebrous,\
  \ yes, and ever-present.\n\u201CThe reference book I sought\u2014All The Toads Of\
  \ Scandinavia\u2014sat on the shelf next to a mighty tome devoted to the history\
  \ of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, fully illustrated with maps and portraits\
  \ (no doubt fanciful) of some of the more illustrious members of that preposterous\
  \ band. I stole this book from a subscription library in Maitland, oh half a century\
  \ ago, and as far as I can recall it has remained unread\u2014until this afternoon.\
  \ Casting toads from my mind for, I supposed, a few minutes, I removed this Mountie-book\
  \ from the shelf and sprawled on my Davenport to bone up on the doings of a foreign\
  \ poliisi.\n\u201CI was at once struck by a skilful engraving showing the stern-jawed\
  \ features of one Captain Crabbage. There was something arresting about his countenance,\
  \ something at any rate which made me want to read about his exploits. These were\
  \ detailed in a chapter entitled \u2018The Prestige Of The Scarlet\u2019, which\
  \ began on the page facing the portrait.\nThe facts of the weird and wild adventure\
  \ which befell Captain Crabbage on Tantarabim Island, I read, may be taken collectively\
  \ as indicative of the many curious secrets awaiting solution in the vastnesses\
  \ of the Arctic. They may be advanced as typical of the experiences to be met with\
  \ by a white man when set down beyond the last vestige of civilisation to explore,\
  \ to govern, and generally to represent Law and Order among a handful of consistently\
  \ ignorant, intermittently violent, and unbelievably superstitious natives; or they\
  \ may be looked upon as\u2014just a story. But chiefly the serve as still another\
  \ illustration of the tremendous prestige of the scarlet worn by Canada's famous\
  \ police force.\n\u201CI was hooked. Yarns of derring-do, particularly those set\
  \ in the polar regions, have always appealed to me. The toads forgotten, I read\
  \ on with increasing glee.\nThe awful character of the scenery\u2014gigantic, barren\
  \ cliffs, enormous, flat-topped mountains capped with snow and cloud, huge valleys\
  \ mothering eternal glaciers, long beaches, ice-girt seas, and great fjords penetrating\
  \ incredible distances into the unknown interior\u2014such scenery as one finds\
  \ in mediaeval panoramas of hell.\n\u201CI read of Crabbage constructing his dwelling-house,\
  \ store-house, and blubber-shed, racing against time with the long polar night only\
  \ three weeks away. And then of his discovery of the Place Of The Big Killing and\
  \ the sorcerer who, in a frenzied trance, announced that he was the Creator, Pingortitsijok,\
  \ wrapped in hides, King of the Ice.\n\u201CAt the point where Captain Crabbage\
  \ returned to Fort Hopton with the sorcerer in handcuffs, something in my brain\
  \ went ping!, and I knew I had made the leap in the dark necessary to understand\
  \ the next clue in Bewg's trail. Oh, it is too complicated to explain. The Big Killing,\
  \ the sorcerer, the handcuffs \u2026 my mind underwent a curious topsy-turvydom\
  \ as I linked these images to gunpowder, gruel, toy flamingoes, a wrench, a cupboard,\
  \ a bee \u2026 all of a sudden that weird couplet of Bewg's, scratched in mirror-writing\
  \ next to an emblem of plague, made stark and incontrovertible sense. I threw the\
  \ book to the floor, grabbed the treasure map, and looked at it as if for the first\
  \ time. Now it all seemed blindingly clear.\n\u201COutside it was already dark,\
  \ and the rain poured down, and Minnie had hidden my umbrella, but I no longer cared.\
  \ I slammed the door behind me and walked all the way across town to the Derelict\
  \ Orchard. Bewg had been there before me. His shovel was there, shining, leaning\
  \ against a pile of stones. I dug, dug, dug. Abominable pains attacked my skeleton,\
  \ but I kept on digging in the downpour, down into the mud, until, past midnight,\
  \ I found at last, buried in the muck, a tiny crate of zinc. I pocketed it, and\
  \ made my way back home in the terrible blackness of the Finnish night.\n\u201C\
  It is now half past four on Friday morning. I am sitting in the kitchen, slurping\
  \ from a mug of boiling turnip extract, and the crate is before me on the table.\
  \ I have a little over twenty-four hours to work out how to open it.\u201D\n[2017-10-13]"
