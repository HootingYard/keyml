text: "I mentioned recently that in the first week of March I shall be rejoining the\
  \ international jetset and swooping down upon New York City. This kind of shenanigans\
  \ undermines my reputation as a Diogenesian recluse, but you will be relieved to\
  \ hear that I am bent upon important Hooting Yard business. To wit, the launch of\
  \ this lavish and lovely book:\n\nHere is part of the official press release from\
  \ Westreich Wagner:\n\u201Cworks of James Beckett with constant interjections by\
  \ Frank Key\u201D\nIn a spatially and conceptually complex arrangement of text,\
  \ image and scale, this book is a multi-vocal account of the varied practice of\
  \ Amsterdam-based artist James Beckett. Beckett's work explores minor histories,\
  \ many of which are concerned with industrial development and demise across Europe,\
  \ a process of investigation which is as much physical as it is biographical. The\
  \ pages of this new monograph are littered with associative interjections from the\
  \ archive of Frank Key's radio program \u201CHooting Yard\u201D, as an irreverent\
  \ running commentary. These texts become marginal notes to, and poetic mirrors of,\
  \ the contributions of the book's eleven other authors.\nContributing Authors:\n\
  Will Bradley, Kari Cwynar, Moosje M. Goosen, Will Holder, Virginija Janu\u0161kevi\u010D\
  i\u016Bt\u0117, Kathrin Jentjens, Angela Jerardi, Frank Key, Frances Larson, Catrin\
  \ Lorch, Brian Pugh and Dieter Roelstraete.\nThe launch itself, which will feature\
  \ Mr Key spouting his texts out loud, takes place from 6.00\u20138.00 PM on Monday\
  \ 4 March at 114 Greene Street, Floor 2, New York, NY 10012. Should any fanatically\
  \ devoted Hooting Yard readers and listeners wish to attend, please send a note\
  \ to the publishers here.\n[2013-02-20]"
