text: "\u201CThere is, one must admit, a certain association of vulgarity with the\
  \ onion. It is a valuable food, and an indispensable accessory to the culinary artist;\
  \ but as used by many people it is not suggestive of refinement. And yet the bulb\
  \ has not only an honourable character\u2014it has a sort of sacred history.\n\u201C\
  Both Pliny and Juvenal, among old writers, and many Egyptologists of our own time\
  \ and country, have recorded that the ancient Egyptians worshipped the onion. It\
  \ is true that Wilkinson, who wrote on the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,\
  \ doubts the evidence of this; but he adds that the onion was admitted as a common\
  \ offering on every altar, and that the priests were forbidden to eat it. In Ellis's\
  \ History of Madagascar it is noted that the Malagasy of our time regard the onion\
  \ as unclean, and forbidden by the idols.\u201D\nBut the onion can be a weapon in\
  \ the fight against crime!\n\u201COvid\u2026 says that both onions and sulphur were\
  \ given to criminals to purify them from their crimes, upon the old theory of purgation\
  \ by fumigation.\u201D\nExtracts from Storyology\_: Essays In Folk-Lore, Sea-Lore,\
