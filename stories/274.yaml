  \ November is one of those times, for on that day you should drop what you're doing\
  \ and go to Slough for An Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose. David\
  \ OutaSpaceman will provide the lugubrious music, and I shall be declaiming lopsided\
  \ prose from the Hooting Yard archive. You can find details, including a handy map,\
  \ here, if you scroll down the page a bit.\nAddendum\_: Ten thrilling photographs\
  \ from the evening can be found here.\n[2007-10-31]"
