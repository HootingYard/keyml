  \ further research. In the Comments, Mary O'Grady helpfully led me to the entry\
  \ on this orphaned Belgian peasant in Butler's Lives Of The Saints, and I have also\
  \ been consulting any number of Catholic websites. Those of you who do not have\
  \ time to devote to such devotional devotion, and would prefer the simpler option\
  \ of watching a brief video, are referred to Busted Halo (\u201Can online magazine\
  \ for spiritual seekers\u201D) where you can watch an episode of my new favourite\
  \ show, Father Steve's Spooky Saints. Dig that crazy Catholic animation, daddy-o!\n\
