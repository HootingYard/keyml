text: "\u201CIn spite of the fact that the Ancient Egyptians enjoy rather more popularity\
  \ than their contemporaries, it is evident that the books which they wrote are closed\
  \ books to those who have not the glamour of vanished peoples, and the fascination\
  \ of mighty cities now made desolate, strong upon them. Yet in the heterogeneous\
  \ and pitiful flotsam that reluctant seas have washed to us piecemeal from a remote\
  \ past, there are, as will be shown later, many things which, although proceeding\
  \ from a culture and modes of thought as far removed from our own as they may well\
  \ be, are worth the reading.\u201D\nBattiscombe G Gunn, Introduction to The Instruction\
  \ Of Ptah-Hotep And The Instruction Of Ke'gemni (1906)\n[2010-05-18]"
