text: 'There was an item on the Today programme on BBC Radio Four this morning about
  a new scientific study of penguins. I am afraid I was not paying due attention so
  cannot enlighten you. However, it did serve to remind me that, in the long ago,
  when I used to draw pictures, I once depicted, in the medium of pen and ink, a scientific
  experiment upon a penguin.
