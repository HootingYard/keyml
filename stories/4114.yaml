text: "The time is right, I think, to flex my ornithological chops by setting a daily\
  \ bird-related challenge. By doing so, I hope to silence forever those fiends who\
  \ mutter darkly that \u201CActually, Mr Key is a complete ignoramus in matters avian\u201D\
  . It is astonishing, is it not, that such brickbats can be thrown? Yet they are,\
  \ with distressing regularity. Well, let us see how the birdy know-alls deal with\
  \ the first of these challenges!\nYour task, which you must accept on pain of Aubreyan\
  \ kim kam, is, bebooted and with your bird spotters\u2019 book tucked in to the\
  \ pocket of your rainwear, to locate and identify the following birds, as mentioned\
  \ in Slouching Towards Kalamazoo by Peter De Vries (1983):\n\u201CThat there is\
  \ no bluebird of happiness, only the robin of resigned acceptance of things as they\
  \ are. The plain everyday starling of common, undeluded reality\u2026 and then what\
  \ next?\u2026 The grackle of total disillusionment?\u201D\nSo there are four birds\
  \ to spot, and spot well. No ordinary bluebirds, nor robins, nor starlings, nor\
  \ grackles, mind. And, once spotted, you must execute pencil or crayon sketches\
  \ of each, and post them, or links to them, in the Comments carton. Off you go!\n\
