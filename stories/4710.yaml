text: "Glad tidings from Pointy Town, where there has been a massive increase in the\
  \ number of applications to join the local chapter of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club.\
  \ You will recall that a troop of Pointy Town Weldists, on an ill-starr'd charabanc\
  \ outing, made an important archaeological discovery. If by chance you do not recall\
  \ it, I can refer you back to an account of it through the magic of \u201Chet internet\u201D\
  \ hyperlink.\nIncidentally, did you know that British Telecom once tried\_\u2014\
  unsuccessfully\u2014to claim copyright of the word hyperlink? That is true, though\
  \ you ought not believe similar stories, such as Tesco laying claim to the phrase\
  \ sausages on the cheap, The Grauniad trying for muddle-headed leftie blather, or\
  \ both the BBC and ITV attempting to copyright maverick police officer with \u201C\
  issues\u201D.\nAnyway, it appears that the tale of the finding of the tomb of Anaxagrotax\
  \ has drummed up an unprecedented amount of interest in the Tuesday Weld Fan Club,\
  \ in spite of the fact that many younger Pointy Towners have absolutely no idea\
  \ who Tuesday Weld is. Perhaps they think if they are allowed to join the club they\
  \ will be taken on charabanc outings by sinister, spidery drivers, although my understanding\
  \ is that there have been no excursions since the one reported here. In fact, there\
  \ is some mystery regarding the precise activities of the Fan Club, for they have\
  \ held no jamborees, jumble sales, Weldathons or film screenings for a very long\
  \ time. Even their newsletter, Weld!, published every week on Tuesday, has ceased\
  \ to appear in the newsagents\u2019 kiosks of Pointy Town.\nI did manage to track\
  \ down the minutes of the most recent executive committee meeting, but it was difficult\
  \ to wring any sense out of them. Take this, for example:\nWe lent our ears to a\
  \ man standing on one leg, who puffed upon a flute and called us fools. When he\
  \ did so, he stretched out the \u201Coo\u201D in \u201Cfools\u201D so that it lasted\
  \ several minutes. During the whole time he maintained his monopod posture. Eventually,\
  \ he was asked by Weldist No. 472 how this imprecation related to Tuesday Weld.\
  \ In reply, he gave another somewhat wheezy puff on his flute and stole softly away,\
  \ like Jack-in-the-Green.\nIs this evidence of some sort of esoteric hoo-hah going\
  \ on in the preciously staid atmosphere of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club? Certainly\
  \ the sheer numbers of new applicants suggest a coup or takeover. But what in heaven's\
  \ name could their agenda be? I shall keep a beady, if myopic, eye on these matters,\
  \ and may send Mrs Gubbins to be an infiltrator among the infiltrators.\nMeanwhile,\
  \ to keep you occupied while you await further developments, here is a cut out \u2018\
  n\u2019 keep Tuesday Weld to print, \u2018n\u2019 cut out, \u2018n\u2019 keep upon\
  \ your mantelpiece. Dust it often, and dust it well.\n\n[2010-07-07]"
