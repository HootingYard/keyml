text: 'And did those feet? Well, did they? I don''t give two pins about the time,
  whether it was in ancient time or modern time or some other time, I just want to
  know if those feet did, and if they did, what it was, exactly, that they did. I
  suppose you will tell me that they walked. Lawks-a-mercy!, I''d never have guessed.
  Those feet walked, did they? Take me to the foot of our stairs! And don''t get me
  started on that holy lamb of God. If I catch sight of it I''ll have it sheared and
  its fleece spun and knitted into a pair of woolly socks before you can say Jack
  Spraggins. And I will put those socks on my feet and I will walk, yes, I will walk
  upon England''s mountains green. Just try to stop me, buster.
