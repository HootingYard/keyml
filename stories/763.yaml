text: "\n\u201CAnd about bloody time!\u201D I hear you cry. At long last, after much\
  \ travail, the new Hooting Yard anthology is available. Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude\
  \ & Pippy Bags contains no fewer than a hundred and one stories eked from the pea-sized\
  \ but pulsating cranium of Mr Key. 340 pages, or thereabouts, packed with common\
  \ sense, with a few pictures thrown in, including that old favourite the Chumpot\
  \ Patent Soap label. Now you can curl up in your exciting 60's style wickerwork\
  \ seating pod, or sprawl on a lawn in a snowdrift during a winter picnic, and furrow\
  \ your brow as you grapple with the exceedingly sensible doings of exceedingly sensible\
  \ characters such as Dobson and Pebblehead and Tiny Enid and fictional athlete Bobnit\
  \ Tivol.\nSimply click on the picture to order your copy.\n[2008-10-23]"
