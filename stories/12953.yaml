text: "Another dispatch from our man in Ulm:\nI am still in Ulm. I may be here for\
  \ the foreseeable future. Yesterday I told you that I was stricken, after lunch,\
  \ by jellybrain and cork-in-the-ears. My symptoms have abated not one whit. I am\
  \ not entirely sure what a whit is. Perhaps it is related to a squib which, you\
  \ might have noticed, in your reading over the years, is invariably described as\
  \ damp. I have never come across a squib that was moist, or wet, or soaking wet,\
  \ or drenched, let alone one that was dry, or bone dry. No, a squib is always damp.\
  \ Can the same be said for the whit?\nYou might be waiting for me to apologise for\
  \ digressing, impatient as you must be to hear of the latest doings in Ulm. But\
  \ apologise I will not. I have much else to contend with, such as my medical condition(s)\
  \ and that gas leak (still not fixed). Added to which, there has been a bittern\
  \ storm over the city, the sky is almost black with bitterns, and I have had to\
  \ light a candle to see by. Then there is the question of whits and squibs, and\
  \ the revelation that not a single gazebo in Ulm is owned by a beekeeper, at least\
  \ not legally. There may be squatters, off the grid.\nSo I think it is plain that\
  \ being your man in Ulm is no picnic. I cannot remember when last I went on a picnic.\
  \ This is made all the more galling when one thinks how easily available are sausages\
  \ so suitable for picnics. Instead I must eat these sausages indoors, or at best\
  \ at a table on a pavement outside a caf\xE9. Would it count as a picnic, I wonder,\
  \ if I spread a blanket on the pavement, a few feet away from the table, and sprawled\
  \ there, eating my sausages? I think I would be liable to arrest, as a pavement\
  \ nuisance.\nThat is all I have time to babble on about today, from Ulm. Some might\
  \ describe this dispatch as a damp squib. If so, don't blame me. Blame the bitterns,\
  \ whose stormy appearance in the sky over Ulm has blotted out the sun, and made\
  \ us all a little more prone to gloomy thoughts. The pig in his sty is a happier\
  \ fellow.\nOver and out, your man in Ulm.\n[2014-08-07]"
