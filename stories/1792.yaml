text: "Here is another much-requested piece. Although I have read it, more than once,\
  \ on the radio, it has never appeared in written form anywhere. I was planning an\
  \ anthology of stories in 1993, just before the Wilderness Years, of which this\
  \ would have formed a part, but that book never did see the light of day. As with\
  \ The Book Of Gnats, if I were writing the story today it would be different, here\
  \ and there, but I have left it in its original state, more or less.\nFreakishly\
  \ tall, draped in a soutane, my brain pounding, I found myself standing before a\
  \ trench full of sludge. In each hand, I discovered I was holding a bucket of pungent\
  \ goo. My feet were encased in sturdy plastic bootees and at least two pairs of\
  \ socks. I squelched across the trench, each step expelling from the sludge noisome\
  \ fumes that wafted in the air behind me, shimmering and stinking. After some minutes,\
  \ I clambered on to the other side, and rested the buckets upon the ground. Sulphurous\
  \ fires ablaze within my skull, I had made the crossing from LIFE into DEATH. Eternity\
  \ was before me.\nThat was six weeks ago, and I have now prepared this preliminary\
  \ report of my impressions. I do not doubt that as further aeons pass, what follows\
  \ may appear na\xEFve, churlish and inaccurate. I shall file a more detailed report\
  \ in ten billion years or so, and it will be instructive for scholars to compare\
  \ the two documents. I repeat: these are very much first impressions.\nIn marshalling\
  \ my material, I have plunged the majority of my notes into the Chute Of Rack And\
  \ Ruin, which is on the mezzanine floor of the larger of the Two Damp Buildings.\
  \ First, because to include everything would make this report too long and unwieldy.\
  \ Second, because I have come to enjoy the whirring and clanking noises emitted\
  \ by the Chute when it is put into operation. It is my fondest hope that, however\
  \ limited and fragmentary the material, my readers will nonetheless gain a useful\
  \ insight into what awaits them after death.\nSo far I have discovered four pubs:\
  \ The Butcher's Vest, The Consumptive Stalinist, The Tenth Chaffinch, and The Smouldering\
  \ Maw. To get into the latter, you must be in possession of a special ticket issued\
  \ by the River Police, whose headquarters is in a small hut at the bottom of a flight\
  \ of stone steps a few hundred yards north of the Moribund Dam. To get into the\
  \ hut, however, you need a licence from the Buffed-Up Shield Committee, which meets\
  \ only once every four thousand years. It is typical of my luck that it met just\
  \ two days before I arrived here. From what I have heard, The Smouldering Maw has\
  \ the very best drinks in the afterlife, and what's more they are free. My friend\
  \ Ringchock, who has been here for untold centuries, recommends a peculiar brew\
  \ they serve called The Hoist. It is effervescent, curdled, of a startling lavender\
  \ tinge, and after four pints you get to join Captain Snap's Committee, of which\
  \ more later.\nI have been able to get in to the other three pubs mentioned, none\
  \ of which has any restrictions on entry. The Butcher's Vest is the only one worthy\
  \ of repeated visits. Its landlord, a bat-eared titan whose name is unpronounceable,\
  \ comes from the same village as me, although he lived there many centuries before\
  \ I was born. We have had many little chats, although his speech is hard for me\
  \ to follow, as he is toothless, and slobbers uncontrollably. The range of drinks\
  \ is somewhat limited, but the landlord provides enticing snacks for his regular\
  \ customers. Each of the tables has a bowl of boiling hot custard on it, into which\
  \ one can dip a staggering selection of biscuits, crackers, buns, tarts and pastries.\
  \ Often these are stale, but when moistened with sufficient custard they are quite\
  \ palatable. The tables are rickety, though, so one must be careful to avoid spillages,\
  \ which enrage the landlord to the point where his hair stands on end, his face\
  \ turns purple, and he gets his cronies to hurl the offender into an open sewer\
  \ which runs past the back door.\nYou may find it difficult to believe, but absolutely\
  \ everyone here is dressed from head to foot in corduroy. When I made the crossing,\
  \ you will recall I was wearing a soutane. I have no idea why. At Reception, however,\
  \ I was ushered into a little cubicle and given a set of corduroy apparel to change\
  \ into: hat, shirt, jerkin, underpants, pantaloons, socks and moccasins. The soutane\
  \ was taken away and I have not seen it since. Later, when I was taken to my quarters,\
  \ I discovered a wardrobe full of corduroy clothing.\nAh yes, my quarters. What\
  \ is accommodation like on the other side of the grave? Well, pokey. The population\
  \ is, of course, ever-increasing, so overcrowding is a seemingly insoluble problem.\
  \ Contrary to popular belief, as far as I can remember, we do not have unlimited\
  \ space. Those who have been here for an unimaginably long time can only dimly remember\
  \ when they had a small room all to themselves.\nI share my tiny cabin with seven\
  \ others. Binns was a whaling captain. Al Aqbuz ran a luxury hotel. Rosemary and\
  \ Lettice, who perished together in one of the earliest railway accidents, were\
  \ distressed gentlewomen; they still are, come to that. Scrut was some sort of hill-peasant.\
  \ Nugg, our longest-serving resident, appears to have been a caveman as far as any\
  \ of us can tell. He smells astonishingly unpleasant. Min Toc Thing babbles endlessly\
  \ about her glorious life in an imperial palace of the Orient, and treats the rest\
  \ of us with contempt.\nThrown together with dead people whose lives were so different,\
  \ it might be thought that the afterlife is one long round of fascinating conversations,\
  \ broadened horizons, and limitless opportunity to compare ideas, feelings, throbs,\
  \ pangs, perceptions and beliefs. Would that it were so! Unfortunately, language\
  \ acquisition (and, indeed, any kind of mental development) simply does not happen\
  \ here. Thus, Nugg is locked in his strange and distant world, goes out of his mind\
  \ with confusion when he sees a wheel, for example, and spends most of his time\
  \ grunting, hammering his fists on the floor, and defecating where the fancy takes\
  \ him. Binns told me an uproarious story about how he once took Nugg with him to\
  \ The Butcher's Vest and forced eight pints of grut down the poor wretch's throat.\
  \ In the resulting mayhem, Nugg smashed the pub to smithereens before passing out\
  \ quite happily in the sewer, where he spent the next year or so recovering.\nThe\
  \ fact that we all wear virtually identical corduroy clothing also makes things\
  \ difficult. You simply can't tell whether the person lounging by the bus stop is\
  \ a thirteenth century Mongolian warlord, a Victorian entomologist, the murdered\
  \ heir to the throne of Finland, a milkman from Wivenhoe, an arch-druid, a CIA assassin,\
  \ a Baltic potato farmer, one of Hannibal's mahouts, Ethelred the Unready, or an\
  \ ex-pope. The chances are that any attempt you make at light conversation will\
  \ be doomed from the start through mutual unintelligibility, so after a while you\
  \ don't even bother to try. I have only been here for six weeks, and am already\
  \ affected by this social lethargy.\nOur cramped living conditions are intolerable,\
  \ and it is not surprising that fights and squabbles are common. I try to spend\
  \ most of my time out and about, going back home only to sleep. In my first week,\
  \ I made inquiries about changing cabins, but to do so is apparently impossible.\
  \ They have a massive ledger at Reception, and they pencil in your name against\
  \ whatever accommodation is available, and that's it, for ever and ever and ever.\n\
  I have been given a job at the dairy. We have thousands of cows, an efficient bottling\
  \ plant, good refrigeration facilities, and a delivery system that runs like clockwork.\
  \ Buttermilk is increasingly popular, and we also produce sour cream, cheeses, yoghurt,\
  \ and very nice little cartons of whey. Of course, fresh milk forms the bulk of\
  \ our production, and although we no longer do home deliveries, we make sure that\
  \ the milk-kiosks are always fully stocked. After a month in the single cream department,\
  \ I was promoted. I am now Captain Of The Churns, and I wear a special badge.\n\
  The spiritualists among you will be pleased to hear that this place is fairly riddled\
  \ with ectoplasm. Viscous, refulgent, and shimmering, it hovers above the rooftops,\
  \ curls in wisps in every room, darts hither and thither in the air wherever one\
  \ cares to look. What purpose it serves is a mystery. There are scholars here, of\
  \ course, and many of them are using Eternity to puzzle over this enigmatic substance.\
  \ Books roll off the presses in frightening quantities. On a visit to the library\
  \ last week, I noted the following titles, all of them published since my arrival:\
  \ The Ectoplasmic Gazetteer; The Lustre Of Ectoplasm; Two Noddles On A Bight; Ectoplasmus\u2014\
  Essays In Hieratic Crumpling; Heaven's Porridge; Ectoplasmic Phantasms; and Ectoplasm's\
  \ New Hub\u2014An Ibarguengoitian Summary. Learned journals devoted to the subject\
  \ are piled high in corridors and pavilions. Hot and hate-filled debates are broadcast\
  \ on the radio, as two or more experts dispute each other's theories, shouting their\
  \ heads off and resorting to infantile bickering.\nTrue fanatics spend months at\
  \ a time in the Ectoplasm Park, near the railway sidings, where the gleaming substance\
  \ has somehow been corralled and controlled, hanging low in the air above a large\
  \ circle of verdant lawns. The visitor to the Park is literally enveloped in ectoplasm,\
  \ breathing it in through every pore. What the effects are of such exposure I do\
  \ not know, as I have yet to experience them. Needless to say, those who visit the\
  \ Park come away with wildly different stories to tell. The letters columns of the\
  \ ectoplasm journals are full of first-hand reports, the writers\u2019 reactions\
  \ varying from blinding ecstasy to stultifying boredom. I will not bother to reproduce\
  \ any of this verbiage here. You will have time enough to read it when you are dead.\n\
  I have yet to meet Captain Snap, but stories about him are rife. Most of them seem\
  \ to be about the various high-jinks and scamperies he got up to when he was alive.\
  \ Ask about his role in the afterlife and there is an ominous, even terrified, silence.\
  \ No one appears to know which cabin he lives in, if, indeed, he lives in a cabin\
  \ at all. On a promontory by the Mud Wastes there stands an enormous, misshapen\
  \ castle, like something out of a child's nightmare. Some insist that Captain Snap\
  \ inhabits it, surrounded by minions, but this seems unlikely. Every month there\
  \ are charabanc outings to the castle, and the tourists, chosen by raffle-ticket,\
  \ are able to roam all around it at will. Perhaps Captain Snap hides in the broom\
  \ cupboard, or makes himself scarce, during these visits. Who knows?\nMost people\
  \ are only able to drink half a pint of The Hoist before passing out, so rigorous\
  \ training is necessary if one aspires to join Captain Snap's Committee. As with\
  \ so much else here, the Committee's function is a mystery. Opinions vary. There\
  \ are those who accuse the Committee of regulating every aspect of the afterlife.\
  \ Others say it is merely a drinking club. Binns swears blind that the members are\
  \ able to return to earth, for short periods, as ghosts, but that for some reason\
  \ they are only able to haunt desolate, winter-wracked seaside resorts. I am sure\
  \ he is just making that up.\nAs with ectoplasm, so with grace. There is a vast\
  \ amount of it here. When I was alive, I remember that Christians used to bang on\
  \ about grace all the time, but I must admit I never worked out precisely what it\
  \ was. From what I did gather, however, I can confidently say that, as with most\
  \ aspects of the afterlife, they were very wide of the mark.\nAt Reception, they\
  \ give you a large tub of grace and tell you to look after it very carefully, and\
  \ not to open it until you get the word. Not that they are trusting. Being a curious\
  \ sort, I tried to open my tub as soon as I got to my cabin, and discovered that\
  \ it had a safety catch on the lid, a nasty little mechanism which snapped over\
  \ my fingers and clamped them tight against the tub so that I howled in agony. Binns,\
  \ chuckling at my naivety, sent me off to the Tub Inspectors, who freed my fingers,\
  \ dabbed them with ointment, reset the catch, and gave me a ticking-off.\nAs for\
  \ \u201Cthe word\u201D, upon receipt of which I can open my tub, to date I have\
  \ not met a single person who has ever been given it. Everybody has their pristine,\
  \ unopened tub. Some people carry them around with them, although personally I find\
  \ the pockets on our clothing are not roomy enough. You can buy little wicker baskets,\
  \ into which the tubs fit quite snugly, and you see those quite often. But like\
  \ most people, I keep my tub of grace in a tiny wooden locker in my cabin.\nThe\
  \ postal system is charming. Rickshaws, stacked with packets and parcels, and pulled\
  \ along by brightly-uniformed Prussians, career through the streets, if \u201Cstreet\u201D\
  \ is the correct word for the stinking, muddy channels which criss-cross our domain.\
  \ For some reason you have to be a Prussian who died during the nineteenth century\
  \ to get a job as a postal worker. This seems to me rather unfair, and were I not\
  \ so happy at the dairy I would raise a stink about it. When I first learned about\
  \ this closed-shop employment practice, I assumed that the Prussians got the jobs\
  \ because, with their stereotypical passion for order, they ran a tight ship and\
  \ kept stern bureaucratic control of so potentially chaotic a service. I soon discovered\
  \ how wrong I was. The great thing about the postal system here is that it is entirely\
  \ random. You can write a letter, tie up a parcel, shove a few nick-nacks into a\
  \ packet, and deposit it in a postbox, and you simply never know who the recipient\
  \ will be. If you waste your time carefully addressing your mail to a particular\
  \ individual, you are summoned to the Post Office Headquarters and made to do an\
  \ hour's stamp-licking duty, while ferocious hounds bay at you from an adjoining\
  \ room.\nThere is a big metal fence completely surrounding this place. It is electrified.\
  \ I have spent long hours peering through its mesh of lethal wires, trying to see\
  \ what lies beyond it, but all I can make out is an indistinct beige and mauve blur.\
  \ A distant, mesmerising clamour is just about audible. Those who have tried to\
  \ cross it have found themselves instantly surrounded by gangs of brutish myrmidons,\
  \ whose golden helmets are burnished and gleaming. Merciless and inexplicable, they\
  \ enwrap their captives in grey corduroy shrouds, intone a litany of awfulness and\
  \ dread, and convey them at hideous speed to the mezzanine floor of the Big Damp\
  \ Building, whence they are despatched, muffled, stricken and aghast, into the Chute\
  \ Of Rack And Ruin. As it whirrs and clanks, they are forever swept away, they are\
  \ swept away and gone.\n[2009-02-14]"
