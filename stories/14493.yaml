text: "Dobson was seething. The twentieth century's great out of print pamphleteer\
  \ was sitting at his breakfast table absolutely seething. Pausing before spooning\
  \ a dollop of marmalade-style pipless jellied-eel goo into her mouth, Dobson's inamorata\
  \ Marigold Chew observed \u201CYou appear to be seething, Dobson\u201D.\n\u201C\
  Indeed I am, oh light of my life,\u201D said the pamphleteer, \u201CI have a lengthy\
  \ list of exasperations which I would happily recite to you, the better that you\
  \ may understand the multifarious sources of my seething.\u201D\n\u201CPerhaps not,\
  \ Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CInstead, I would rather that you seethe\
  \ elsewhere than at the breakfast table. Have you considered going to Seething to\
  \ seethe?\u201D\n\u201CI have not,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CAnd where in the name\
  \ of high heaven is Seething?\u201D\n\u201CSeething is a tiny village in the county\
  \ of Norfolk,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CAbout nine miles south-east of Norwich.\
  \ Its church, St Margaret's, has a round tower, though that is not strictly relevant.\
  \ I am told that the villagers of Seething often seethe, about all sorts of exasperations,\
  \ and I feel sure you would find a welcome there.\u201D\n\u201CThen seethe in Seething\
  \ I shall!\u201D shouted Dobson, and he rose from the table, pulled on his Ivory\
  \ Coast crop-dusting co-pilot's boots, and crashed out of the door into the teeming\
  \ downpour. So heavy was the rain, so thick the mist, so broken his pocket compass,\
  \ that the pamphleteer became almost immediately lost. When, eventually, he came\
  \ to a halt, he was not in Seething at all. Dobson had wandered as far as the county\
  \ of Cornwall, and found himself in the tiny village of Splat.\nDobson was splatting.\n\
