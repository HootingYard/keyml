text: "A while ago I waxed nostalgic about the Malice Aforethought Press, Mr Key's\
  \ early adventure in small press publishing. Now I have recalled, out of the blue,\
  \ that back in the benighted 1970s, when I was but a teenperson, I embarked on a\
  \ similar, even more amateurish, project. I do not know what has suddenly brought\
  \ this to mind, but I thought it might be of some passing interest to the fanatical\
  \ devotees among you lot.\n\u2018Twas in the year 1978 that I turned my attentions\
  \ to what at the time I thought was \u201Cproper writing\u201D. The first fruit\
  \ of this was a piece called Jonathan Owl-Catcher, which as far as I recall was\
  \ based on an original idea, as they say, by my pal Carlos Ortega. In the interests\
  \ of clarity I should point out that this was not the Venezuelan union and political\
  \ leader of the same name, nor any relation to Daniel Ortega, the President of Nicaragua.\
  \ Having mentioned the title, I must now confess that I remember nothing else about\
  \ this story whatsoever.\nIt was with the second piece written at this time that\
  \ I had the bright idea of publication. Remember these were the heady days of punk\
  \ and the DIY aesthetic pioneered by the splendid Desperate Bicycles. Having written\
  \ Uncle Harold Swats At A Moth With A Broom-Handle And Lives To Tell The Tale, what\
  \ I ought to have done was (a) said to myself \u201CLord God Almighty, that is an\
  \ unwieldy and awful title\u201D, and (b) torn it to shreds and stuffed the shreds\
  \ into a burning fiery furnace.\nInstead, I somehow convinced myself that there\
  \ was a market for this juvenilia, and I proceeded to storm it. My storming was\
  \ distinctly ill-conceived and inept. I did not even bother to make the story into\
  \ a pamphlet. I simply photocopied it and fixed the four or five pages together\
  \ with a staple in the top left corner. At least it was typewritten rather than\
  \ done by hand.\nI now had to sell the thing, so I decided to place an advertisement.\
  \ There was at the time a monthly magazine called Vole, an early organ of the ecowanker\
  \ tendency. Actually it was a far better publication than that makes it sound, edited\
  \ as it was by the late Richard Boston. Boston was a Grauniad journalist whose writing\
  \ was both witty and learned. His 1976 book about the British pub, Beer And Skittles,\
  \ was a sort of Bible for my elder brother, and I shall always remember a newspaper\
  \ piece he wrote about the prep school teacher recruitment agency Gabbitas & Thring.\
  \ Until I read that, I thought the pair had sprung fully-formed from the mind of\
  \ Ronald Searle.\nI was a keen if na\xEFve reader of Vole, so I reasoned that all\
  \ its other readers would be deeply fascinated by my fiction. Accordingly, I placed\
  \ an ad in the classifieds, offering my story for sale by mail order. As I had to\
  \ pay by wordage, and the title was so wretchedly long, I think the entire text\
  \ of the ad amounted to little more than the title, followed by \u201Cshort story\u201D\
  , followed by my name and postal address. Yes, children, that was the kind of thing\
  \ we did in the days before Het Internet.\nRemarkably, it seems to me now, I received\
  \ about five replies. One of these people even wrote back, offering words of encouragement.\
  \ I wish I could remember his name. He was, now I think of it, the first person\
  \ outside my immediate family and friends, who ever read a word of mine. Good God!\
  \ He might even be reading this, now! If so, please get in touch. On the other hand,\
  \ given the passage of time, it might be a case of R.I.P. Nameless or not, ye shall\
  \ be remembered.\nDuly encouraged, I bashed out another story, The Bassoon Recital.\
  \ I used the proceeds from my five sales to pay for an advert, again in Vole, for\
  \ this new piece. (I think\u2014I hope\u2014I sent my mentor a free copy.) It was\
  \ less successful than the first, selling perhaps two, or it might have been three.\
  \ But fewer, fewer.\nInterestingly, no alternative approach occurred to me. As I\
  \ am sure you are shouting, I could have, for example, waited until I had written\
  \ a handful of pieces and cobbled them into a proper pamphlet. Or I could have submitted\
  \ them to magazines. And if I must insist on trying to sell stapled sheets of A4\
  \ to punters, I could at least have advertised them elsewhere. But no. By the time\
  \ I wrote the last piece, On The Quayside, I had become discouraged, and I do not\
  \ recall advertising it at all.\nSo what became of them, these masterworks? It is\
  \ possible, if I rummaged sufficiently, that I might find a yellowing dog-eared\
  \ copy mouldering at the bottom of a cardboard box in a cupboard. I may indeed make\
  \ such a rummage. In the meantime, I will tell you what I remember.\nThe \u201C\
  plot\u201D, if we can dignify it with that word, of Uncle Harold Swats At A Moth\
  \ With A Broom-Handle And Lives To Tell The Tale is given in the title. I don't\
  \ think anything else actually happens.\nThe Bassoon Recital would be more interesting,\
  \ influenced as it was by Edward Gorey. Unfortunately that is about all I can recall.\n\
  Of the three, I think On The Quayside is the one I would be least embarrassed to\
  \ post here at Hooting Yard, were I to fall upon it while rummaging. I remember\
  \ that the text was deliberately laid out so each paragraph consisted of a single\
  \ sentence. I remember that the tale involved a crate being hoisted off a ship on\
  \ to a quayside, and a stevedore taking charge of it, and discovering that within\
  \ the crate was a demented ostrich. I think the whole thing took place in what we\
  \ might call Hooting Yardy weather, that is, rain, mist, gales.\nAnd after that,\
  \ silence, until a few years later, when the Malice Aforethought Press was brought\
  \ howling into the world, and the first vague outlines of Hooting Yard could be\
  \ discerned.\n[2012-09-11]"
