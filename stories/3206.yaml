text: "\nOuta_Spaceman rightly calls into question the caption on this photograph.\
  \ \u201CSurely this is none other than Tiny Enid?\u201D he asks. Indeed, it is almost\
  \ certainly the plucky little fascist, and one wonders why the captioneer felt the\
  \ need to pretend it was a tot called Doreen. Note that the besuited chap in the\
  \ background is holding the heroic infant's lit cigarillo and bakelite prize ashtray\
  \ behind his back.\nThere have of course been innumerable attempts to rewrite the\
  \ true history of Tiny Enid. Readers are advised to rely solely on the accounts\
  \ given here. We know what we're talking about at Hooting Yard.\n[2009-10-01]"
