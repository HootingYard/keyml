  Goblins attacks family, burn down homestead

  Readers will be aware that I take a keen interest in goblins of all types. These
  ones are new to me:

  Others went on to claim that snake-like creatures wearing sunglasses, a suit and
  a pair of shoes had been seen at the homestead.

  Truly baffling. What type of snake-like being could wear shoes? Sounds like a job
  for Investigating Officer David Icke.
