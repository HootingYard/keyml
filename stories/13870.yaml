text: "Yes, yes, I know there has been an unseemly silence at Hooting Yard for a while.\
  \ There are a number of reasons for this, the only one of interest to you lot being\
  \ that I have received the page proofs for Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief\
  \ Lives, to be published (at last!) by Constable in September. This is my final\
  \ opportunity to proofread the text of this classic reference work, so you can imagine\
  \ your beloved Mr Key peering myopically at the pages, brow furrowed in concentration,\
  \ trying not to dribble, and having to go and have a lie down in a darkened room\
  \ every once in a while.\nMeanwhile, for those of you suffering from Too Few Postages\
  \ At Hooting Yard Mental Imbalance Syndrome, I ought, belatedly, to let you know\
  \ that ResonanceFM is now uploading editions of the radio show on to its Mixcloud\
  \ page almost as soon as they are broadcast. That link takes you to all the Resonance\
  \ programs\u2014this link is to the Hooting Yard shows currently online. (If it\
  \ doesn't work, just search for Hooting Yard from the main page.) That should keep\
  \ you occupied for the time being.\nBack soon, with unfurrowed brow.\n[2015-03-03]"
