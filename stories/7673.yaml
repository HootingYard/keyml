text: "Reader Kimika Ying has unearthed a treasure from the past.\n\nDear Mr. Key,\
  \ she writes, I've found a book which put me in mind of Hooting Yard which I would\
  \ like to pass along, \u201CThe Infant Moralist\u201D by Lady Helena Carnegie and\
  \ Mrs. Arthur Jacob, published in 1903. Public domain versions of the book, with\
  \ a delightfully illustrated copy of the original, are located here\nIt contains\
  \ some of the usual moral lessons on \u201CThe Consequences of Greed\u201D, \u201C\
  Profanity\u201D, \u201CEnvy\u201D, \u201CCourage\u201D, etc. What caught my attention\
  \ were the less commonly heard ones: \u201CInsensate Mischief\u201D, \u201CInevitable\
  \ Retribution\u201D, \u201CUnsuitable Jesting\u201D, and \u201CIll-Timed Levity\u201D\
  .\nAnd this:\nTHE CHATTERBOX\nI needs must beg you, Caroline,\nTo cease your Chatter\
  \ whilst I dine.\nIt deafens every Ear.\nJohn Footman cannot hear my Words,\nAnd\
  \ I have asked him twice for Curds\nAnd still he cannot hear.\nIf Caroline were\
  \ with us today she would undoubtedly have a cell phone out at the dinner table\
  \ as well. Anyway, all fine moral lessons and a good addition to any library. It\
  \ also occurs to me that this book might be a superior replacement for the usual\
  \ deadly dull workplace employee handbook.\n[2011-11-23]"
