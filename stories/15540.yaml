text: "I write these words with immense difficulty, and in frantic haste. If what\
  \ I believe is true, I have little more than an hour, perhaps two, before my mind\
  \ will lose its moorings, the brain inside my head will be reduced to a twitching\
  \ jelly of miasmic horror, and I will be a hopeless case, raving and gibbering and\
  \ throwing myself against the walls of this padded cell. I am confined here upon\
  \ my own insistence. I had to demand that the lunatic asylum staff lock me up, and\
  \ keep me locked up. If, in an hour or two's time, I was free to roam the streets\
  \ among other men, I shudder to think what unimaginable chaos and havoc would be\
  \ wrought. No, I must remain here, isolated from a world that must, must be protected\
  \ at all costs from me \u2026. or rather, from the \u2026 thing that I will soon\
  \ become.\nCan it really be only a week ago that I was sitting at home, surrounded\
  \ by my familiar magnets and retorts and cylinders, in peace and comfort, without\
  \ a care in the world other than the incessant yapping of my neighbour's dog and\
  \ the incessant tinkling of the bell dangling from the collar round my neighbour's\
  \ dog's neck and the incessant ululating incantations of my neighbour himself, incantations\
  \ devised to summon forth the incarnation of the hideous bat-god Fatso, incantations\
  \ which, thank the heavens, had proved unsuccessful for twenty years and which,\
  \ one hoped, would remain unsuccessful for a further twenty years and, indeed, forever\
  \ after? The yapping and tinkling and ululating aside, I was, as I say, in peace\
  \ and comfort, and could never have imagined the inexplicable horror that was about\
  \ to unfold. It has been just one week, but I feel I have lived through a thousand\
  \ years, nay!, a thousand centuries, a thousand millennia in that time.\nIt all\
  \ began, prosaically enough, with the telltale sound of the daily postal delivery\
  \ dropping onto the mat. I put aside the lemon meringue pie I was eating and went\
  \ to retrieve it. I flicked briefly through the items: a couple of bills, a letter\
  \ from my bankers, the latest copy of the Reader's Digest\u2014I quickly scanned\
  \ the contents page and made a mental note to read, at the earliest opportunity,\
  \ the article about bringing a monkey out of a medically-induced coma\u2014a couple\
  \ of advertising flyers, and\u2014fatefully, as I was to learn\u2014a black envelope,\
  \ addressed by hand in gleaming silver lettering, bearing a postage stamp which,\
  \ though I looked at it from every conceivable angle, and then from several inconceivable\
  \ angles, resisted all attempts to see it clearly. It seemed somehow to shift in\
  \ shape and colour and size, to become invisible and then visible again. I could\
  \ not even tell whether it was self-adhesive or had had to be affixed to the envelope\
  \ with a lick of spittle from a human\u2014or inhuman?\u2014tongue.\nPlacing the\
  \ rest of my post in the wicker basket on my escritoire, I returned to the breakfast\
  \ table, took another mouthful of lemon meringue pie, and opened the envelope carefully.\
  \ The letter inside was unexpectedly ordinary\u2014a single sheet of white paper,\
  \ covered in black handwriting of commendable neatness and legibility.\nDear Mr\
  \ Key, I read, I have long been an admirer of your Hooting Yard weblog and the associated\
  \ podcasts on Resonance FM. It is an enthusiasm fully shared by my colleagues in\
  \ the Faculty of Blasphemous and Forbidden Studies at Miskatonic University, Arkham,\
  \ from where I write this letter. To be wholly accurate, I should say that I am\
  \ writing from the campus annexe in Innsmouth, where the faculty offices are based.\
  \ Such is our admiration for you that we wish to issue an invitation. There is work\
  \ that needs to be done\u2014important and urgent work\u2014and we think you are\
  \ the man to do it. It is a somewhat delicate matter, and I am reluctant to put\
  \ the details down in writing\u2014and not merely reluctant. Let us say, rather,\
  \ that the prospect of committing those details to pen and paper fills me with a\
  \ terrible, nameless dread. For this reason, I would be grateful if, at your earliest\
  \ convenience, you would telephone me on the number given below.\nThe number followed,\
  \ and the letter was signed\u2014in a florid if shaky hand\u2014by Professor Charles\
  \ Dexter Nyarlathotep, Dean of Faculty. I immediately picked up my telephone receiver\
  \ and dialled.\nAfter a few rings, there was a click, as if my call had been answered,\
  \ but no one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up when my ear caught\
  \ a faint suspicion of sound. Was someone trying, under great difficulties, to talk?\
  \ As I listened, I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise\u2014\u201C\
  glub \u2026 glub \u2026 glub\u201D- which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate,\
  \ unintelligible, word and syllable divisions. I called \u201CIs that Professor\
  \ Nyarlathotep?\u201D but the only answer was \u201Cglub-glub \u2026. glub-glub\u201D\
  \ Then my interlocutor, whoever it was\u2014whatever it was\u2014hung up.\nIf there\
  \ is one thing I learned from President Nixon it was the advisability of tape-recording\
  \ all my conversations. (A second thing I learned from him was to relieve stress\
  \ by mashing potatoes, but that was not pertinent to the current situation.) I plucked\
  \ the cassette from the machine and hurried next door. I did not go to my ululating\
  \ neighbour with the yapping dog and the yapping dog's tinkling bell, but to my\
  \ neighbour on the other side. This fellow happened to be an eminent and distinguished\
  \ retired professor of Comparative and Applied Ichthyolinguistics, and I was certain\
  \ he would be able to help me to understand the strange sounds from the telephone\
  \ call. Sure enough, having played the tape back to him, my neighbour was able to\
  \ make an instant translation.\n\u201CI have communed with many fish and other aquatic\
  \ beings,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd I recognise this at once as the lingua franca\
  \ of a particularly hideous and unimaginably horrible spawn of the chthonic depths\
  \ of the sea, depths so deep that all light is blotted out and the creatures there\
  \ are grotesque blind albino monsters with writhing flippers. One must listen intently\
  \ to each \u2018glub\u2019 to discern its meaning. In this case, it seems you are\
  \ being invited to Miskatonic University for the purpose of writing the authorised\
  \ biography of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, author of the Necronomicon.\u201D\n\
  I thanked the professor, gave him the remainder of my lemon meringue pie, returned\
  \ home, packed a suitcase, and made my way to the railway station, where I caught\
  \ the next train to Arkham. At Arkham, I would need to change trains to proceed\
  \ on the branch line to the university campus annexe at Innsmouth. It was a long\
  \ journey, and I passed the time by reading my xeroxed copy of Ebn Khallikan's early\
  \ (12th century) biography of Abdul Alhazred. This was the text that claimed, among\
  \ other things, that the mad Arab had been seized by an invisible monster in broad\
  \ daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses.\
  \ I did not believe a word of this, nor of much else in the book, and as the train\
  \ passed through bosky rustic backwaters, I grew confident that, as the authorised\
  \ biographer, appointed by Miskatonic University, I could do a far better job.\n\
  When, eventually, we arrived at Innsmouth, I booked myself into a dilapidated and\
  \ ill-starred boarding house by the quayside. The landlady was a swarthy, bloated\
  \ dwarf of cretinous appearance. I suspected she was the product of centuries of\
  \ inbreeding. When completing the register, she asked me, in her weirdly strangulated\
  \ guttural caterwaul of a voice, punctuated by almost reptilian hisses, to state\
  \ the nature of my business. Rather than trusting her with the truth, I claimed\
  \ to be an aide de camp to President Nixon, scouting possible locations for a branch\
  \ of his presidential library. She scribbled this into her ledger without comment.\n\
  It was late, and I was tired, so I declined the landlady's offer of supper\u2014\
  which appeared to consist of a bowl full of boiled, writhing tentacles swimming\
  \ in a mixture of brine and goat's milk\u2014and I retired to my room. As I opened\
  \ the door, I reeled and nearly swooned. It was cramped and filthy and the wallpaper\
  \ depicted ungodly patterns, in colours beyond any spectrum known to human science\
  \ and lines and shapes of some bizarre, alien geometry. I flung myself on to the\
  \ fantastically uncomfortable bed and prayed for sleep. For several hours I tossed\
  \ and turned, but eventually I lost consciousness. How I wish I had not! That night,\
  \ for the first time since infancy, my dreams were haunted by \u2026 the Grunty\
  \ Man!\nMost people of my generation will be familiar with this loathsome monster.\
  \ It was common, when I was a child, for parents to frighten their children to sleep\
  \ with spine-tingling tales of this creature, dwelling in a deep dark dank cave,\
  \ hairy and grunting and covered in sores and suppurating boils, a hideous being\
  \ older than the universe, older than time and space, grunting, drooling, stinking,\
  \ and ever prepared to come lumbering out of the maw of his cave to visit unimaginable\
  \ havoc upon the innocent. He had terrified me as a tiny tot, and he terrified me\
  \ now, the more so because the nightmare was so inexplicably vivid.\nEventually,\
  \ mercifully, I awoke from this hideous phantasm. I was twitching and shattered.\
  \ After cursory ablutions, I went downstairs to the breakfast room. When I saw that\
  \ breakfast was the same bowl of tentacles as the supper of the night before, I\
  \ excused myself, and crashed unsteadily out of the door. I decided to head straight\
  \ for the campus to seek out Professor Nyarlathotep. The sooner I obtained comprehensive\
  \ details of my commission, and signed a contract, the sooner I could leave this\
  \ benighted, wretched, vile seaside hellhole.\nAfter a short bus ride to the campus,\
  \ it was a simple enough matter to locate the Faculty of Blasphemous and Forbidden\
  \ Studies and, once inside, to find the professor's office. A young woman was sitting\
  \ at a desk in the anteroom.\n\u201CYou must be Mr Key,\u201D she said, \u201CI\
  \ am Miss Dimity Cashew, the professor's secretary. I am afraid he is not here right\
  \ now He is off somewhere or other, consulting an abominable tome written in an\
  \ unknown and possibly bestial alphabet.\u201D\nShe was a pallid and asymmetrical\
  \ figure, with a club foot and one withered leg, a withered arm, several extra fingers\
  \ on one hand and several fingers missing on the other, eyes of different colours\
  \ which seemed always to be looking in wildly different directions, and her lank\
  \ hair was scattered with breadcrumbs and a twig or two. I was transfixed. My dementedly\
  \ thumping heart seemed ready to burst from my breast. I could barely speak, but\
  \ I managed to splutter some incoherent words. Dimity agreed to join me for a stroll\
  \ along the Innsmouth promenade.\nIt was a whirlwind romance, and five days later\
  \ we were married in St Bibblybibdib's church. Only on the morning after our wedding\
  \ night did I snap out of my lovestruck daze and remember why I had come to Innsmouth\
  \ in the first place.\n\u201CThe authorised biography of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred!\u201D\
  \ I cried, \u201CI must go to see the professor at once!\u201D\nThese words had\
  \ a strange effect on my new bride. Dimity seemed to shrink visibly and clutched\
  \ desperately at the bedsheets. Already pallid, what little colour there was drained\
  \ from her face. She shook her head violently, sending twigs and breadcrumbs flying\
  \ from her lank hair across the room. And then, for the first time since I had met\
  \ her, both of her eyes swivelled to fix in the same direction, and she looked straight\
  \ at me.\n\u201CFor god's sake!\u201D she screamed, \u201CPhn'glui mglw'nafh! Wgah'fhtagn!\
  \ The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps \u2026 the abomination of\
  \ abominations \u2026 I never would let him take me, and then I found myself there!\
  \ Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Hooded Thing bleated \u2018Kamog! Kamog!\u2019 In the\
  \ place of utter blasphemy! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! My brain! It's tugging\u2014\
  from beyond\u2014knocking\u2014clawing\u2014Ngr'hfglkhar! The Goat with a Thousand\
  \ Young! \u2026 Oh God!\u201D\nLike a fool, I dismissed this as delirium, a fit\
  \ of the vapours. I told Dimity to have a nice cup of tea and to get some more sleep.\
  \ And I hurried out towards the faculty office \u2026 and, had I but known it, towards\
  \ my own destruction.\nThere is little more to tell. I ran to the faculty building\
  \ and through into the anteroom, past Dimity's empty desk, until I stood at the\
  \ professor's door. I knocked, and heard from inside a weird eldritch unfathomable\
  \ rustling and panting and \u2026 grunting. I threw open the door, and rushed in,\
  \ and found myself in a room as deep and dark and dank as the cave of the Grunty\
  \ Man. It was the cave of the Grunty Man! And there, in the Stygian blackness, looming\
  \ before me, was the Grunty Man himself, in the form of the withered, ancient figure\
  \ of Professor Nyarlathotep.\n\u201CAh! At last!\u201D he wheezed, \u201CI have\
  \ been waiting for you. Every ten thousand years, I require a new host body. And\
  \ here you are!\u201D\nAnd before I had time to scream, or flee, the hideous being\
  \ shot across the darkness towards me and somehow inserted itself, body and soul,\
  \ its very being, into me. I felt it settle, adjusting its horrible contours to\
  \ mine, feeling its way into me, physically and mentally. Desperately, I clung on\
  \ to a small corner of my brain that remained my own. I have continued to cling\
  \ to it for as long as I can, but I grow weaker and weaker, and the \u2018me\u2019\
  \ that clings will soon be no more. That is why I ran as fast as I could to this\
  \ lunatic asylum and, at gunpoint, demanded to be confined in a padded cell. Its\
  \ walls and locks will keep humanity safe for a time. But the time will come, years,\
  \ centuries hence, when the locks will rust and the walls crumble \u2026 and then\
  \ the Grunty Man will lumber forth, in his awful grunting horror, and he shall have\
  \ dominion over the earth, and all the other planets in all the other universes,\
  \ forever and ever. I am the Grunty Man!\n[2017-08-09]"
