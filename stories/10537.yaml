  \ My picnic button, too, was pecked and snatched and carried away by a crow. For\
  \ all I know, it might have been the same crew that took my panic button. Perhaps\
  \ there is a separate piece to be written about lost buttons, for I have lost many\
  \ buttons, so many, I had not thought crows had undone so many.\nMy picnic button\
  \ was an heirloom, as you will probably have guessed. You do not see so many of\
  \ them these days. They were popular in the interwar years. Their exact purpose\
  \ is no longer clear, but at the time there was scarce a picnic embarked upon in\
  \ these isles where a picnic button was not taken along, in the hamper, or in the\
  \ pocket of one of the picnickers. We will investigate further after I have told\
  \ you the story of how I came to be in possession of one, until it was cruelly snatched\
  \ away from me, by a crow.\nMy uncle Quentin was a world-famous and bad-tempered\
  \ yet loveable scientist from Kirrin Island. When he died, we found his entire worldly\
  \ goods stored in four supermarket carrier bags. It was a heteroclite jumble, including\
  \ the skull of a hare, an envelope from L. Garvin, Honey Merchants, containing grey\
  \ mullet scales, a cheese box containing a puffin's beak, together with a Windsor\
  \ & Newton leaflet containing advice on the control of moth damage to paint brushes,\
  \ an envelope containing snow bunting feathers, a list of mills from Merionethshire,\
  \ an envelope containing bits of silver foil (\u2018from Aunt Ethel\u2019), a book\
  \ of telephone numbers\u2014containing none, an exercise book containing a hair\
  \ prescription from a Dr Ferguson of Bromsgrove, a large photo of sheep in a slate\
  \ pen, various brown envelopes (empty), an envelope containing a single dead prawn,\
  \ and a picnic button. Curiously, the picnic button apart, this collection of bits\
  \ and bobs was identical to the contents of the four supermarket carrier bags containing\
  \ the worldly goods of the late R.S. Thomas and his wife, as noted in Byron Rogers\u2019\
  \ biography of the poet. [I am indebted to Nige for alerting me to this.]\nAfter\
  \ my uncle's funeral\u2014where, according to his wishes, his corpse was encased\
  \ in a gigantic wicker man and set ablaze\u2014my siblings and cousins and I divvied\
  \ up the contents of the carrier bags. We realised, after aligning the items on\
  \ a baize tabletop and counting them, that their number matched exactly those of\
  \ us there gathered. So we decided upon a raffle. It was by this means that I acquired\
  \ the picnic button and bore it away, in a pocket of my Tyrolean sports-casual jacket,\
  \ which I wore to the funeral in defiance of all etiquette. Everybody else was dressed\
  \ in the correct black, from head to toe. I like to think Uncle Quentin would have\
  \ approved of my jacket-decision, for he was a great fan of The Sound Of Music (Robert\
  \ Wise, 1965), and would softly sing \u201CEdelweiss\u201D, word-imperfect, on the\
  \ rare occasions when he was not in a bad temper.\nAs soon as I got home, I took\
  \ down from the bookcase The Encyclopaedia Of Buttons and read up on my newly acquired\
  \ picnic button. This is what I discovered:\nDuring the interwar years, no picnic\
  \ in these isles was complete without a picnic button. One among any complement\
  \ of picnickers would be designated the buttoneer, and be charged with bringing\
  \ the picnic button to the picnic. It would either be carried in the hamper or in\
  \ the buttoneer's pocket. Written picnic reminiscences are sparse on detail of the\
  \ button, and today, in the postwar years, there are two rival theories regarding\
  \ the purpose of the picnic button. These may be scientifically summarised as follows:\n\
  The picnic button was always a bright and glittery button, and was placed at edge\
  \ of the picnic blanket. Its brightness and glitter were designed to attract the\
  \ attention of, for example, swooping crows or similar picnic predators. It was\
  \ thought that, dazzled by the button, any swooping crow (or similar) would have\
  \ its attention distracted from picnic essentials such as cream crackers, sausages,\
  \ or cans of Squelcho!, which it might otherwise grasp in its savage talons and\
  \ carry away in flight. Thus a picnic button was very rarely among the items needing\
  \ to be packed up and loaded on to the brake at the end of the picnic. Keen picnickers\
  \ of the era kept a huge supply of picnic buttons for this very reason.\nThis theory\
  \ has been comprehensively demolished by Wigmarole et al in A Discursive Analysis\
  \ Of The Picnic Button 1918\u20131939, wherein it is argued that the picnic button\
  \ was merely a so-called \u201Cspare button\u201D taken to the picnic in case one\
  \ of the participating ladies\u2019 or gentlemen's buttons became snagged on a thorn\
  \ or similar pointy brambly bit of vegetation, and thus loosed, and thus detached,\
  \ and thus lost, upon the ground, or in a puddle.\nDinsby, the picnic historian,\
  \ fired back with a broadside arguing that such a button would only have ever been\
  \ called a spare button, and not a picnic button. At time of writing [1962] the\
  \ controversy has yet to be resolved.\nAnd fifty years later, that remains the case.\
  \ All I am able to say on the matter is based on my own experience. The week after\
  \ Uncle Quentin's funeral, I went on a picnic in the field where the charred remains\
  \ of the wicker man still smouldered. I placed my heirloom picnic button on the\
  \ edge of the picnic blanket. Before I even had time to remove from the hamper the\
  \ cream crackers and sausages and cans of Squelcho!, down swooped a crow and snatched\
  \ the button in its beak, and flew away into the wild blue yonder. I have not had\
  \ the heart to have a picnic since that terrible day.\n[2012-11-06]"
