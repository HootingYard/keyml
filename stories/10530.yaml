text: "When she observed that I was boggle-eyed and twitching and panting, I explained\
  \ to my lifestyle coach that I suffered from debilitating panic attacks.\nBy the\
  \ way, if you do not have a lifestyle coach, I strongly recommend that you acquire\
  \ one. Mine is peculiarly expensive, but I think some come at a discount. I can\
  \ say without fear of contradiction that since hiring my lifestyle coach I have\
  \ become a butterfly where once I was a caterpillar. I fly where once I crawled.\
  \ Actually, it is not true that I say that without fear of contradiction. Plenty\
  \ of people will line up to contradict me, to charge that I more closely resemble\
  \ a creature crawling upon its belly upon the earth. Hence my panic attacks.\n\u201C\
  What you need,\u201D said my lifestyle coach, \u201Cis a panic button.\u201D\nHappily,\
  \ she had a box full of such buttons in her desk drawer, and sold one to me there\
  \ and then. It was peculiarly expensive, for a button, and there was no discount\
  \ available.\nWhen I got home, I sewed the button on to my jacket, roughly in the\
  \ vicinity of my heart. The idea was that, whenever I felt a panic attack coming\
  \ upon me, I should clutch at the button desperately. To avert the risk of ripping\
  \ the button loose, in my desperation, I sewed it on using a good deal of extremely\
  \ strong thread, as my lifestyle coach advised. I need hardly add that the jacket\
  \ to which I chose to affix my panic button was of Tyrolean sports-casual cut, similar\
  \ to that worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965).\
  \ It is my jacket du jour, every jour.\n\nTyrolean sports-casual jacket, prior to\
  \ affixation of the panic button\nNow it is a curious fact that many people think\
  \ they know much about buttons without really knowing the first thing about them.\
  \ To the untrained eye, for example, my panic button looked like a stray button\
  \ inexplicably sewn on to my jacket more or less over where my heart was pounding\
  \ like a steam hammer. The button-ignorant might posit the slapdash handiwork of\
  \ a myopic or distracted sempstress. Thus, prancing along the boulevard in the autumnal\
  \ sunshine for the first time since affixing my panic button, I was emotionally\
  \ prepared for the barrage of catcalls and brickbats I was sure to receive. If and\
  \ when an urchin pointed at my heart and shouted \u201COi, mister! You've got a\
  \ stray button there on your Tyrolean sports-casual jacket! Looks like it was sewn\
  \ on by a half-blind sempstress!\u201D, I would not need to clutch at my button\
  \ in desperation to stave off a panic attack. Already it seemed to be working its\
  \ magic, helping to keep a sense of gibbering terror welling up and undoing me.\n\
  As it happened, on that first outing with the panic button, I had no cause to clutch\
  \ at it at all. It was if, with the reassurance of its presence, all the usual prods\
  \ to my panic vanished. Louring clouds, misaligned paving slabs, yapping puppies,\
  \ bookshop window displays piled high with Jeanette Winterson paperbacks . . . where\
  \ usually I would shriek and stagger boggle-eyed and twitching and panting through\
  \ the streets, I was a picture of calmness and insouciance. I may even have essayed\
  \ a whistle, a chirpy tune half-remembered from a childhood jamboree.\nOn the corner\
  \ of Ringo Starr Street and Erebus & Terror Mews, I bumped unexpectedly into my\
  \ lifestyle coach. She was sitting on a bench feeding birds with stale bread from\
  \ a greaseproof paper bag.\n\u201CI have to say,\u201D I had to say, \u201CThis\
  \ panic button you sold me is worth every penny! I have been out and about now for\
  \ ten minutes and not once have I felt even the merest pang of panic. I have not\
  \ had to clutch at it in desperation once!\u201D\nShe turned her head to look at\
  \ me and there was an eerie cast to her countenance.\n\u201CFeed the birds, tuppence\
  \ a bag, tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag,\u201D she said.\nI looked at her more\
  \ closely and realised she was not my lifestyle coach after all. Or, if she was,\
  \ she had aged by several decades since I saw her the day before. I felt a sudden\
  \ tremor of fear.\n\u201CFeed the birds, tuppence a bag, tuppence, tuppence, tuppence\
  \ a bag,\u201D she said again, gazing straight into my eyes with a look I could\
  \ now see was a hideous admixture of amusement and fathomless malevolence.\nBirds\
  \ were swooping around us in teeming profusion, crows and linnets and sparrows and\
  \ starlings and tippihedrens and peewits. Instinctively, I knew the moment had come\
  \ to clutch at my panic button. But as I raised my hand towards my heart, where\
  \ the button glittered on my Tyrolean sports-casual jacket, one of the birds swooped\
  \ in and pecked it clean away. I had used extremely strong thread, but it was no\
  \ match for the sharp savage beak of the crow. The bird flew up and up, carrying\
  \ my panic button away into the sky, the sky where I ought to have been fluttering\
  \ like a butterfly. Instead, in my panic I tottered and fell to the ground, upon\
  \ misaligned paving slabs, down on my belly like a caterpillar. I clutched at the\
  \ strand of broken thread where my button had been. My lifestyle coach, or the aged\
  \ biddy who had taken her place, stood up from the bench, and trod upon the small\
  \ of my back as she shambled away with her now empty greaseproof paper bag. The\
  \ louring clouds broke, and a deluge poured down upon me. I was unbuttoned and undone.\n\
