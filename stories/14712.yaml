  \ say, \u201Cbut it hardly ever rains in Goosbeck, due to certain geographical oddities\
  \ I am unqualified to expound upon.\u201D I would have you expound upon them nonetheless.\
  \ Rainfall is a topic of quite staggering interest to me, and I am always keen to\
  \ hear more about it, even from the unqualified. And there is nothing to stop you\
  \ embarking on a course of study in rainfall in any case, ending with a certificate\
  \ or diploma, and then you would be qualified to expound. But you remain silent.\
  \ You do not take up my challenge. You gaze over my shoulder, and in the distance\
  \ you can see the flattened ruins of Goosbeck, or you could if you were wearing\
  \ your specs. But you left them on the sideboard in your hotel room, because you\
  \ are forgetful. You are forgetful because you have reached a great, improbable,\
  \ age. You are so old you remember the last time rain fell in Goosbeck and the tarpaulins\
  \ were hauled out and spread, with love, over things that might otherwise have got\
  \ wet. And so, on the outskirts of what once was Goosbeck, in vegetation and in\
  \ awe, we make a handshake last for hours. As dusk descends, you trudge back to\
  \ your hotel, and I turn and return to the ruins. I should coco.\n[2016-06-08]"
