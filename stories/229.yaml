text: "Can we decently admire a feat of engineering which led to the destruction of\
  \ an owl sanctuary, the obliteration of a fairground, and the destitution of a grubby\
  \ yet loveable hamlet of genetically intriguing peasants? For some, the answer is\
  \ a straightforward \u201Cno\u201D. They will point to the facts\u2014and they are\
  \ unassailable facts\u2014that the Blister Lane Bypass was completely unnecessary,\
  \ and that in the years since its construction a mere handful of carts have ever\
  \ been seen toiling along its grey Stalinist empacture. Yes, I meant carts, not\
  \ cars.\nConversely, one might argue that owls are hardly in need of sanctuary,\
  \ that the fairground was a den of iniquity, and that the peasants would presumably\
  \ rather be sunk in paupery than be sent to the salt mines. Let us not forget that\
  \ owls are savage and pitiless birds of prey. Do you imagine that, if the tables\
  \ were turned, such creatures would provide humans with a refuge? The fairground\
  \ was a notorious sink of vice. If we are ever to revive in young hoodies the virtues\
  \ of piety and probity, such places of so-called entertainment will have to be burned\
  \ to the ground, roadworks or no roadworks. As for the hamlet, it is true that the\
  \ peasants\u2019 hopeless hovels were smashed and destroyed during construction\
  \ of the Bypass, but they are free to gather at the roadside in the wind and the\
  \ rain, hawking their baubles and moaning their dirges, free too to accept alms\
  \ from any passing traffic. They were not, I repeat, sent to the salt mines, primarily\
  \ because we have no salt mines in this fabulous land.\nThe original plans drawn\
  \ up for the Blister Lane Bypass are among the loveliest drawings I have ever seen.\
  \ They were done in a variety of coloured crayons on gigantic sheets of greaseproof\
  \ paper, and have a childlike vivacity, annotated as they are with marginal pictograms\
  \ of heraldic beasts, imaginary cloud formations, and cartoonish tombstones and\
  \ mausolea. It has been suggested that the infantile quality of the drawings is\
  \ due to the fact that the plans were nothing more than a wet Thursday afternoon\
  \ project for the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage, and that there was never any serious\
  \ intent to build the Bypass at all. This is poppycock.\nOne advantage of the Bypass\
  \ that is often overlooked, and never of course mentioned by the sort of fatheads\
  \ who prattle on about poor fluffy owls, is that a cart laden with canisters full\
  \ of volatile gas or toxic sludge now has an impeccably flat level surface to trundle\
  \ along. Some of us remember when such cargoes had to negotiate twisting tracks\
  \ riddled with potholes and crevasses, with the constant risk of toppling over.\
  \ Such spillages explain why there are so many poisonous ponds and ditches, riddled\
  \ with mutant toads, throughout our land. It is true that such a cart will only\
  \ be seen on Blister Lane Bypass once in a blue moon, but all great advances begin\
  \ with tiny steps, or, in this case, tiny trundles.\nThe Bypass has been celebrated\
  \ in song, most notably perhaps in Trebizondo Culpeper's opera bouffe \u201CAriadne\
  \ auf Naxos und Blister Lane Bypass\u201D. A tremendously exciting, and inadvertently\
  \ blood-drenched, production was given at the Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre to\
  \ celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first hammer blow to the head of a grubby\
  \ peasant protestor.\nTo end these brief notes, here is a little quiz. How many\
  \ tunnels were built under the Bypass to allow safe crossing for badgers, stoats\
  \ and weasels? Was it a) one, b) six hundred and sixty-six, or c) umpteen thousands?\
