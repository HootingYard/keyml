text: "In her book Neglected Classics Of Hysterical And Overwrought Prose, the scholar\
  \ Constance Mufton mentions in passing \u201Can out of print pamphlet by Dobson\
  \ in which he gives a highly amusing account of his purchase of a chartreuse weskit\u201D\
  . This reference, buried in a footnote to a footnote to a footnote, long perplexed\
  \ Dobsonists of various stripes, none of whom could identify with any confidence\
  \ the pamphlet Mufton had in mind.\nAn alarming young Dobsonist named Ned Pondlife\
  \ tracked down the aged scholar to a chalet perched on a flinty outcrop, and hammered\
  \ at her door, intending to question her directly about the source of her assertion.\
  \ Nowhere else is there any record of Dobson wearing, or even owning, a weskit,\
  \ chartreuse or otherwise, and Pondlife thought that if he could solve this admittedly\
  \ small mystery his reputation as a Dobsonist would be boosted. Alas, upon opening\
  \ her chalet door, Constance Mufton took one look at the young upstart and fell\
  \ into a swoon, a swoon that presaged a decline, a decline which had her carted\
  \ off to a bewilderment home, a bewilderment home where she muttered and dribbled\
  \ and chewed brazil nuts and sucked butterscotch and finally passed into the Realm\
  \ Beyond Petty Earthly Cares. Indeed, Ned Pondlife's countenance was truly terrifying.\
  \ On a blistering September day during his childhood, Pondlife had had the misfortune\
  \ to be attacked by both a flock of starlings and a swarm of hornets, and although\
  \ he was left with no physical scars, thereafter the horror of what he had undergone,\
  \ on the lawn and at the mouth of the cave, in the September sunshine, in his little\
  \ sailor's suit, aged six, could be seen on his face, all twitching and bonkers.\n\
  The ambitious young Dobsonist's next step was to consult an inventory of the out\
  \ of print pamphleteer's wardrobe, if such a thing existed. He visited any number\
  \ of libraries and academic institutions, clutching a bus pass, but wherever he\
  \ went found he had to avert his gaze from frightened puppies which yapped at his\
  \ approach, and his progress was thus accompanied by such a din that serious research\
  \ became impossible.\nQ\u2014Why were there so many puppies in the vicinity of these\
  \ libraries and seats of learning?\nA\u2014Because the puppies were the offspring\
  \ of the guard dogs, left free to roam with impunity until they were old enough\
  \ to join the elite corps of library hounds and do sentry duty in their turn.\n\
  Ned Pondlife was in danger of growing old and creaking before he discovered the\
  \ truth about Dobson's chartreuse weskit. From time to time, he thought about diverting\
  \ his attention elsewhere, by making a special study of Dobson's breakfasts, or\
  \ of his failed thought-control experiments, his pin cushions and pencil sharpeners,\
  \ the big flap when he became wedged in a crevasse, his correspondence with Ringo\
  \ Starr, his lapsang souchong, his tin, his talc, even his encounter with the rancorous\
  \ squeegee goblin. But not one of these projects could ever inspire him as thoroughly\
  \ as the mystery of whether or not Dobson had bought a chartreuse weskit, and if\
  \ he had, when and where he had worn it, and why. What was so maddening was that\
  \ it just didn't seem like a piece of Dobsonian attire. And yet, until her late\
  \ befuddlement, Constance Mufton had been one of the most assiduous of Dobson scholars,\
  \ and her work was respected from Pointy Town to Mustard Parva and beyond. Surely\
  \ she could not be mistaken?\nBut she was.\n[2007-02-13]"
