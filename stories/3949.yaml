text: 'John F Ptak at the invaluable Ptak Science Books blog has a superb post on
  Ranter and anti-Ranter pamphlets of the 17th century, in which he celebrates their
  way with titles, like this one:

  Hell broke loose: or, the notorious design of the wicked Ranters, discovered on
  Sunday last at Black-Fryers Being a true relation of the strange proceedings of
  Mr. Vaughan, and his wicked proselytes; and their entring of Black-Fryers church
  in sermon time, like so many spirits from hell, with four damnable papers in the
  hands, containing such horrible, audacious, and abominable songs, the like not to
  be parallel''d in former ages. With the manner how this onsolent Ranter traced the
  streets from Black-Fryers to Saint Paul''s Church-yard, in his Holland shirt, without
  doublet or breeches, a treble cap, like the Pope''s miter, with silk fring, and
  white shooes, and stockings. With their damnable plots, and conspiracies against
  the ministers of the gospel: their examination before the right honourable the Lord
  Mayor of London; the sad and woful speeched, made by the ringleader of the Ranters,
  concerning the city magistrates, and golden chains: and the committing of them to
  Bridewell till the next sessions. 1650
