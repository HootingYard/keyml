text: "I mentioned the other day that I have mislaid my binder of ornithological resources.\
  \ I have hunted and searched and rummaged and fossicked, high and low, in every\
  \ nook and every cranny, but still have not found it. I would be grateful if you\
  \ would add a plea for its discovery to your daily prayers, for I fear that without\
  \ my bird binder Hooting Yard itself may simply grind to a halt. Without it, whole\
  \ swathes of this website could never have been written.\nIt is a chunky ring-binder,\
  \ somewhat battered with age, into which are crammed a lifetime's accumulation of\
  \ paper-based bird documentation: notes on nesting habits and flight and swoop patterns;\
  \ profile depictions of beaks and bills; feathery prose-poems; transcriptions of\
  \ song and trill and chirrup and caw and shriek and warble and tweet; egg lists;\
  \ talon imprintings; brain scans; analysis of millet and tiny semi-digested mammals\
  \ and owl pellets; and so on ad avian.\nIn the nineteen-seventies, leftist theoreticians\
  \ coined the phrase \u201Cactually existing socialism\u201D to account for the fact\
  \ that Communist regimes such as those in Eastern Europe, rather than being the\
  \ Utopia of their dreams, were drab grey concrete hellholes. By the same token,\
  \ my bird binder represents what I like to think of as \u201Cactually existing ornithology\u201D\
  . It is a field in which my expertise is, or at least ought to be, unquestioned.\n\
  Bereft of my binder, I am lost, like a blind man stumbling in fog, in danger of\
  \ plunging down a crevasse, at the bottom of which are piled the bleached and brittle\
  \ bones of long dead Elephant Birds and Upland Moas and Kangaroo Island Emus and\
  \ West Coast Spotted Kiwis and Korean Crested Shelducks and Amsterdam Island Ducks\
  \ and Pink-Headed Ducks and R\xE9union Pochards and Auckland Island Mergansers and\
  \ Pile-Builder Megapodes and Viti Levu Scrubfowls and Himalayan Quails and Javanese\
  \ Lapwings and Tahitian Sandpipers and North Island Snipes and Eskimo Curlews and\
  \ Great Auks and Canarian Black Oystercatchers and a plethora of Rails, the Antillean\
  \ Cave and the Hawkins and the Red and the Rodrigues and the Bar-Winged and the\
  \ New Caledonian and the Wake Island and the Dieffenbach's and the Vava'u and the\
  \ Chatham and the Hawaiian and the Laysan, among Rails, and Ascension Flightless\
  \ Crakes and Saint Helena Crakes and also from Saint Helena Saint Helena Swamphens\
  \ and then Tristan Moorhens and Mascarene Coots and Colombian Grebes and Bermuda\
  \ Night Herons and New Zealand Little Bitterns and R\xE9union Sacred Ibises and\
  \ Spectacled Cormorants and both Small and Large Saint Helena Petrels and Guadalupe\
  \ Storm-Petrels and Chatham Island Penguins and Bonin Woodpigeons and R\xE9union\
  \ Pink Pigeons and Rodrigues Turtle-Doves and Sulu Bleeding-Hearts and Norfolk Island\
  \ Ground-Doves and Thick-Billed Ground-Doves and Red-Moustached Fruit-Doves and\
  \ Mauritius Blue Pigeons and Dodos and Society Parakeets and Paradise Parrots and\
  \ Oceanic Eclectus Parrots and Newton's Parakeets and Glaucous Macaws and Martinique\
  \ Amazons and Delalande's Cuas and Saint Helena Cuckoos and Guadalupe Caracaras\
  \ and R\xE9union Kestrels and Mauritius Owls and New Caledonian Booboks and Laughing\
  \ Owls and Puerto Rican Barn-Owls and Jamaican Pauraques and Coppery Thorntails\
  \ and Brace's Emeralds and Bogota Sunangels and Turquoise-Throated Pufflegs and\
  \ Giant Hoopoes and Imperial Woodpeckers and Bush Wrens and Chatham Island Bellbirds\
  \ and Lord Howe Gerygones and Mangarevan Whistlers and Nuku Hiva Monarchs and Guam\
  \ Flycatchers and Short-Toed Nuthatch Vangas and both North Island and South Island\
  \ Piopios and Huias and White-Eyed River Martins and Red Sea Swallows and Moorea\
  \ Reed-Warblers and Rueck's Blue Flycatchers and Chatham Island Fernbirds and Tana\
  \ River Cisticolas and Black-Browed Babblers and White-Chested White-Eyes and Rodrigues\
  \ Bulbuls and Aldabra Brush-Warblers and Starlings, so many Starlings!, the Kosrae\
  \ Island and the Mysterious and the Tasman and the Pohnpei and the Bay and the Bourbon\
  \ Crested, among Starlings, and Grand Cayman Thrushes and Cozumel Thrashers and\
  \ Black-Lored Waxbills and Slender-Billed Grackles and Bachman's Warblers and Semper's\
  \ Warblers and Tawny-Headed Mountain Finches and Bonin Grosbeaks and both Lesser\
  \ and Greater Koa Finches and Kakawahies and Black Mamos and Hooded Seedeaters and\
  \ Arabian Ostriches and Bering Cackling Geese, so many dead birds, so many bird\
  \ bones, piled high and white, it is a wonder I could name so many, without the\
  \ aid of my bird binder. Therein lies the beauty, the dazzling beauty, of actually\
  \ existing ornithology.\n[2011-06-16]"
