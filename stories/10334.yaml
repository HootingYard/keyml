text: "Writers of science fiction are fond of the invisible force-field, an unseen\
  \ barrier which unexpectedly stops a spaceman, or the evil Thargon, in his tracks.\
  \ Landscape gardeners of the eighteenth century had much the same idea with the\
  \ invention of the ha-ha. This is a sunken wall, its top at ground level, and bounded\
  \ on the outer side by a ditch. From even a short distance, then, it cannot be seen,\
  \ and the sweeping view of the gorgeous grounds is uninterrupted. It is an invisible\
  \ force-field.\n\u201CHa-ha\u201D would seem to be a variant of the original French\
  \ \u201Cah-ah\u201D, in which form it first appeared in English. Clearly it expresses\
  \ the element of surprise, no different for the eighteenth century person strolling\
  \ in the gardens of a stately home than for the spaceman or the evil Thargon bashing\
  \ up against an invisible force-field in a distant galaxy in the forty-sixth century.\n\
  One such stroller, on an eighteenth century afternoon, was Ned Slop, a factotum\
  \ in the service of Baron Plunkett of Plunkett Hall. Slop had been instructed to\
  \ prune a filbert hedge, and was making his way towards it, armed with a pair of\
  \ shears, when his course took him for a time along one side of the ha-ha. As a\
  \ factotum of some eighty winters, Slop knew every inch of Plunkett Hall and its\
  \ magnificent parkland, its ha-has and filbert hedges, so as he reached the ha-ha\
  \ he had no grounds to be surprised. Nonetheless, on this particular afternoon,\
  \ he did indeed cry \u201CAh! Ah!\u201D upon arriving at the ha-ha, and he dropped\
  \ his shears and hurried at once back to Plunkett Hall.\nTrue hurry was not within\
  \ Slop's gifts, however, for he was an ancient and creaking factotum whose movements\
  \ were akin to those of a Beckettian tramp. Indeed it was almost dusk before he\
  \ staggered into the library, where he found Baron Plunkett. The baron was a scholarly\
  \ baron, and on this eighteenth century dusk he had his head buried in a huge leather\
  \ bound copy of Pontoppidan's Explanations. He looked up as Slop stood panting in\
  \ the doorway.\n\u2013 What is it, Slop? Are the filbert hedges duly pruned?, said\
  \ the baron.\n\u2013 Pant pant pant, panted Slop, Not yet sir, if it please your\
  \ baronial magnificence, for before I was able to prune the filbert hedges I came\
  \ upon something untoward at the ha-ha.\n\u2013 Pray be more explicit, good Slop,\
  \ said the baron.\n\u2013 I don't rightly know how to describe it, sir, except to\
  \ say there was a bit of a brouhaha.\n\u2013 It is not the first time there has\
  \ been a brouhaha at the ha-ha, said the baron, I expect it is merely an intoxicated\
  \ peasant or toppled poacher. Now, pray, leave me to my Pontoppidan.\n\u2013 \u2018\
  Tis neither peasant nor poacher so far as I can descry, said Slop, I know full well\
  \ the sorts of brouhahas they cause, what with their intoxication and illegal rabbits\
  \ and so forth. No, sir, this is a brouhaha of quite another kidney and one I feel\
  \ duty bound as a loyal factotum of some eighty winters to report to you, that you\
  \ may take whatever steps you deem necessary to address it.\nBaron Plunkett sighed\
  \ and put down his Pontoppidan on a side table and heaved himself to his gout-ridden\
  \ feet.\n\u2013 Very well, Slop, fetch my stick, would you?\nAnd so, in the dim\
  \ dusk, the baron and his factotum went a-hobbling and a-creaking across the majestic\
  \ lawns towards the ha-ha.\n\u2013 Christ's wounds!, cried the baron, when eventually\
  \ they reached the spot, This is more than a mere brouhaha, Slop! This is an inexplicable\
  \ calamity! You did well to alert me to it.\nFor before their eyes, the ha-ha was\
  \ littered with the dead, distorted bodies of several peasants and poachers and\
  \ widow-women, each twisted beyond recognition and horribly disembrangulated.\n\u2013\
  \ So inexplicable a calamity, continued the baron, That I dare say not even my revered\
  \ Pontoppidan could explain it in his Explanations.\n\u2013 Ought I hie back to\
  \ the library to fetch your tome, sir?, asked Slop.\n\u2013 No, no, good Slop, that\
  \ will not be necessary. For cast your eyes thither!\nAnd Baron Plunkett pointed\
  \ to the ground some yards away to the left, where, from the ha-ha, a trail of noisome\
  \ green translucent foul bubbling slime stretched across the lawns towards the filbert\
  \ hedges.\n\u2013 Let us follow the trail, Slop, said the baron, And we shall discover\
  \ who\u2014or what\u2014has wrought such hideous horror and disembrangulation.\n\
  \u2013 B-b-but will we not suffer the same awful fate as the peasants and poachers\
  \ and widow-women there sprawled dead in the ha-ha?, wailed Slop.\n\u2013 Fear not,\
  \ Slop, said the baron, I am a baron and a gentleman and I am armed with a stick.\
  \ None durst tangle with me. To do so would be socially unthinkable in this our\
  \ eighteenth century.\nSo the baron and his factotum followed the trail, and that\
  \ is how they came face to face with the evil Thargon, whose time-travelling voyage\
  \ had suddenly and unexpectedly come clunk! to a halt. The space creature had hit\
  \ an invisible force-field in the shape of the Plunkett Hall ha-ha.\nAs Ned Slop\
  \ cowered and piddled in his pants, the baron strode forward and waved his stick\
  \ at the vile shapeless jelly-like pulsating green and yellow and mauve monocular\
  \ repellent many-antennae'd squelchy throbbing sucking and seething blob that was\
  \ the evil Thargon.\n\u2013 Get off my land at once, cried the baron, and he whacked\
  \ the space monster with his stick, whereupon it dissolved in a disgusting belch\
  \ of vapour.\n\u2013 Come, Slop, let us return to the Hall. I shall read further\
  \ in Pontoppidan, and you may spend the rest of the evening scrubbing boots and\
  \ doing other tasks appropriate to your lowly station.\nAnd far far away, distant\
  \ in both time and space, the populations of several planetoids rejoiced at the\
  \ defeat of the evil Thargon.\n[2012-10-11]"
