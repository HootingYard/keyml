  \ of days, due to ludicrous shenanigans with which I shall not bore you. If this\
  \ happens, get your fix by burrowing in the 2003\u20132006 Archives. With luck,\
  \ however, I may be able to delete this entry. Fingers crossed.\nUPDATE\_: I am\
  \ pleased to report that the shenanigans, such as they were, have been averted.\
  \ I was on the point of deleting what I had written above, when a thought popped\
  \ unbidden within my brain, and my hands, looming in readiness above the keyboard,\
  \ loomed still, in mid-air, as if frozen in a snapshot. The thought was this: if\
  \ I leave those measly words in place, could I not use them as a pretext upon which\
  \ to tap out a further barrage of sensible prose? Each day one struggles, as if\
  \ through fog, or mud, or foggy mud, for ideas, for things to say, for observations\
  \ to make, for words to add to the teeming words already bashed from the keys, between\
  \ glugs of tea, or Lemsip, between staring out of the window at the sky and the\
  \ clouds and the flocks of swooping unidentified birds. There are of course more\
  \ bitter struggles, let's not get carried away. And sometimes it is not a struggle\
  \ at all. Sometimes the words come as easily as falling off a log, as they say.\
  \ Twenty two years ago, on the morning after the Great Storm, there were more logs\
  \ lying around from which one could fall, having first clambered to stand upon them,\
  \ than one usually finds in this bailiwick. Ordinarily one might have to walk a\
  \ mile or two, or more, to find a log lying on its side, riddled with worms and\
  \ burrowing tiny beings and grubs. But there were logs aplenty after so many trees\
  \ had come crashing to the ground in the night, battered by howling winds. But perhaps\
  \ I am confusing fallen trees with logs, when they are not quite the same thing,\
  \ or not at all the same thing, and I am just displaying my ignorance of certain\
  \ aspects of the world. It would not be the first time. I rarely check the accuracy\
  \ of my assertions before I tap 'em out, and I never feel constrained to write,\
  \ as that witless piece of advice has it, \u201Conly about what you know\u201D.\
  \ How dull would that be? Only yesterday, for example, I stumbled upon a reference\
  \ to the German film director Wieland Speck. I had never heard of him before, but\
  \ something in his name appealed to me. \u201CWieland\u201D, with its echoes of\
  \ Gothic from Charles Brockden Brown's novel of that name, and \u201CSpeck\u201D\
  , a lovely chunky word one can spit out, and its meaning of a thing tiny and evanescent\
  \ and fugitive. Within five minutes, I had embroidered inside my head a majestic\
  \ canon of Speck films about which I might hold forth, pretentiously, waving my\
  \ arms in dramatic gestures, the cynosure of a salon's worth of credulous admirers.\
  \ I might be wearing a beret, and sporting a goatee, in this little mirage, taking\
  \ languid puffs on a Gitane between singing the praises of an intense black and\
  \ white melodrama of sulky demimondaines directed by Speck in 1966. For me, Speck\u2014\
  pronounced Shpeck, being German\u2014was up there with Fassbinder and Herzog, as\
  \ fecund as the one and as unhinged as the other, and I was ready to write a monograph\
  \ about him. Alas, a couple of minutes of research, made so effortless by the interweb,\
  \ told me that Wieland Speck was not the cinegod of my dreams, merely the director\
  \ of a handful of features that sounded, frankly, a tad mediocre. Twenty two years\
  \ ago, at the time of the Great Storm, before the interweb as we know it, it would\
  \ have taken me much longer, weeks or months or even years, to track down information\
  \ about Wieland Speck, assuming I maintained my interest long enough to do so. My\
  \ private Speck would have had a longer life, with time to grow and develop, before\
  \ the disappointment of the real Speck obtruded. At interweb speed, my dream Speck\
  \ is come and gone in minutes, become a mere mental speck in my own history, and\
  \ would be swiftly forgotten. Ah\u2026 but never forgotten if I write him down,\
  \ no, and never deleted. Had I been so rash as to obliterate the shenanigans above,\
  \ I might never have found myself recalling the glorious fictional cinematic career\
  \ of my mental Wieland Speck, who has as just a claim to posterity as the real one.\
  \ Well\u2026 probably not, all things considered, but you know what I'm saying,\
  \ daddy-o, because I've just said it.\n[2009-04-18]"
