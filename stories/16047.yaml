  In this week''s episode of your favourite radio programme, Mr Key discusses the
  cravat of an unspeakable cad, a village full of cheesegraters, birds and bats and
  the Bible and the BBC, and, last but not least, lint, with particular reference
  to some godawful power ballads.

  As if that were not enough to have you swooning with unalloyed ear-pleasure, the
  show features the return of Miss Blossom Partridge and her knitting tips. Is there,
  or has there ever been, anything on the radio to compare with the sheer moral heft
  of this programme?
