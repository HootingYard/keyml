text: "\nWe interrupt this programme alphabet to point readers, with a pointy stick,\
  \ towards The Dabbler, where this week Mr Key's cupboard contains a couple of pieces\
  \ about Belshazzar's feast. Or, more accurately, one is set before Belshazzar's\
  \ feast, and the other just after it. Intriguingly, when these little tales first\
  \ appeared here at Hooting Yard, many readers thought they were about the Swedish\
  \ pop group Abba, presumably because the protagonists share their Christian names\
  \ with the Scandinavian foursome, and quote lyrics from a couple of their songlets.\
  \ I would like to take this opportunity to make it crystal clear that these are\
  \ sheer coincidences, and no resemblance to any real persons, either living or passed\
  \ beyond mortal realms, was intended.\nADDENDUM\_: The two \u201CBelshazzar's Feast\u201D\
  \ tales, with musical accompaniment provided by legendary noise decomposer Lepke\
  \ Buchwater, will form Mr Key's segment of the Resonance Radio Orchestra evening\
  \ at the Jellyfish Theatre on Sunday 3rd October. (See D is for Date For Your Diary.)\n\
