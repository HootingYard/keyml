text: "I disembarked from the Ship of Fools, and stepped aboard the Weltschmerz Tug\
  \ that would carry me to shore. The woes of the world weighed down the tugboat's\
  \ captain, who would not, or could not, hide his disgust. I was his only passenger,\
  \ and as he steered towards the Island of Pomposity, he spewed forth a litany of\
  \ misery, piling one curdled complaint upon another until I had to stop my ears\
  \ with corks. The sea sloshed, and smelled of rotting aquatic death. I could see\
  \ the land. It was close enough that I could make out various pompous ladies and\
  \ gentleman promenading upon the harbour wall, in fustian and crinoline and tweed.\
  \ But hours passed and the Weltschmerz Tug never seemed to get any nearer the shore,\
  \ though the engine was chugging away, belching foul black blooms of smoke, poisoning\
  \ the seabirds. Was I to be stuck forever between foolishness and pomposity, trapped\
  \ aboard a tugboat with a world-weary captain moaning and spitting and cursing,\
  \ corks in my ears and bile rising in my throat? Yes, I was, and this, I would learn,\
  \ was very Heaven.\nNOTE\_: Tugboat Tales, Number One is here.\n[2010-01-30]"
