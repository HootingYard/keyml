text: 'Hooting Yard is excited (possibly overexcited) to announce publication of Unspeakable
  Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, a decisively sensible novella of high adventure,
  derring-do, and baffling conspiracies. Prior knowledge of arcane philatelic imponderables
  is useful, but not necessary. The book also contains two shorter pieces, one of
  which features mute blind magnetic love monkeys.
