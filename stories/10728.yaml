text: "So that is another year at Hooting Yard done and dusted. Many thanks to my\
  \ readers and listeners, particularly to those who help me keep the wolf from the\
  \ door by sending donations, subscribing, and/or buying my paperbacks from Lulu.\n\
  I was going to list here a few personal favourites from the Year of Our Lord MMXII,\
  \ but then it occurred to me that, really, the best thing you can do is to reread\
  \ the entire year's worth of postages, all 550 of them (not including this one),\
  \ at one prolonged sitting, your brow furrowed in concentration, while outside the\
  \ wind howls and the rain pours down. After all, \u201Cthe proper study of Mankind\
  \ is Hooting Yard\u201D, as Alexander Pope said (attrib.). The attrib., by the by,\
  \ was made by me, just a moment ago.\nI began the year with the demented plan to\
  \ write a thousandish-word essay every day, and persisted until mid-November, when\
  \ the scheme ganged agley due to my (alas, temporary) membership of the international\
  \ jetset. For the Year of Our Lord MMXIII, I have devised a different project, still\
  \ somewhat blurry in my bonce, the first fruits of which will, I hope, appear here\
  \ tomorrow.\nMeanwhile, at the turning of the year it is time to take stock, so\
  \ here is a snap of the actor Nigel Stock (1919\u20131986), who played Dr Watson\
  \ in the BBC's 1960s Sherlock Holmes adaptations, as well as popping up in Brighton\
  \ Rock (John Boulting, 1947) and The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963), among many\
  \ other films.\n\n[2012-12-31]"
