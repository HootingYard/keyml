text: "Today is the feast day of the Jesuit martyr St Edmund Campion. In the long\
  \ ago, I attended a grammar school which bore his name. Each year, on the first\
  \ of December, the school celebrated its patron saint by making all the pupils between\
  \ the ages of 11 and 16 engage in a cross-country run. On a bitterly cold December\
  \ morning, then, instead of sitting in a classroom poring over a Latin textbook,\
  \ we would stand assembled in a field, shivering in skimpy running kit, awaiting\
  \ the barked order from a teacher which would send us scurrying and squelching through\
  \ mud and puddles for a seemingly interminable race.\nI was not an athletic child,\
  \ and the prospect of these runs filled me with something close to despair and rage\
  \ at an unfair universe. In the first year, I avoided it by remaining at home in\
  \ bed, moaning weedily and convincing my parents I was suffering from a terrible\
  \ malady. In the second year, I contrived to be knocked down by a car on the way\
  \ to school and spent the morning in a hospital bed from which I was ejected, being\
  \ unharmed, by midday. In the following three years, however, I took part in the\
  \ annual cross-country run.\nWe are not talking about the real countryside here.\
  \ The school was located in suburban Essex, so the \u201Ccountry\u201D across which\
  \ we were forced to scamper was a few fields and patches of scrubland in the vicinity.\
  \ It was a bleak and awful landscape of mud and brambles and nettles and muck. pitted\
  \ with puddles, often beset by driving rain and howling winds. Much as I loathed\
  \ every second of this annual horror, I realise now that it had a powerful effect\
  \ on my imagination, for if that is not a Hooting Yard landscape, what is?, what\
  \ is?\n[2015-12-01]"
