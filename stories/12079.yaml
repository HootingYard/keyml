text: "So witless are the worlds of television and pop music that when, from time\
  \ to time, a figure emerges in their midst who is capable of stringing a few coherent\
  \ sentences together, they are held up as intellectual titans of our age. One thinks\
  \ of Stephen Fry, regularly\u2014if inexplicably\u2014acclaimed as the possessor\
  \ of the largest and most pulsating brain on this or any other planet. It is a case\
  \ of Triton among the minnows, the majority of television persons being so vacuous\
  \ and stupid that someone like Fry can dazzle simply by using words of three or\
  \ more syllables.\nThe delusion is even more pronounced in pop music, and nowhere\
  \ more preposterously than in the adulation of the lead singer of The Smiths, a\
  \ band that split up a quarter of a century ago. His autobiography has now been\
  \ published as a Penguin Classic. Reread and digest that sentence, please, for it\
  \ tells us much about the pitiable state of our culture, if indeed we could still\
  \ be said to have one.\nWhat we have here is a combination of overweening vanity\
  \ (on the part of the pop singer) and the sacrifice of any literary credibility\
  \ to hard-headed marketing (on the part of the publisher). It would be bad enough\
  \ had Penguin issued it as a Modern Classic, the usual imprint for suitably recognised\
  \ works written after 1918. But no, this solipsistic screed is deemed worthy for\
  \ inclusion in what the Penguin website still maintains is an imprint devoted to\
  \ \u201Cthe best literature of several thousand years and countless cultures\u201D\
  .\nWhen the pop singer said \u201CI'd like my book to be published as a Penguin\
  \ Classic\u201D, the correct response would have been \u201CYou are ridiculous.\
  \ Go away.\u201D\nMy thoughts are with E. V. Rieu, a proper scholar, the original\
  \ editor of the Penguin Classics list, who died in 1972. The poor man will be turning\
  \ in his grave.\n[2013-10-19]"
