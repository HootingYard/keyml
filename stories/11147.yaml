  \ Paraphilia Magazine, captioned \u201CRussian children taking part in a parade\
  \ celebrating birds helpful to farming, 1934\u201D. It is instructive to realise\
  \ that Soviet Communism was not an unalloyed disaster, at least in ornithological\
  \ terms. Needless to say, I am agog to learn precisely which birds were deemed \u201C\
  helpful to farming\u201D. Skylarks? Peewits? Pratincoles? Any readers equally expert\
  \ in birds and Bolshevism should contact me immediately.\n\n[2013-03-17]"
