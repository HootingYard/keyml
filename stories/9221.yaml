text: "\nA few days ago, reading A Land by Jacquetta Hawkes, I came upon this;\nDuring\
  \ a Lyme horse-show a storm developed, and after a terrific flash of lightning three\
  \ people and a baby were seen lying on the ground under an elm tree. The three adults\
  \ were dead, but the baby, Mary Anning, \u2018upon being put into warm water, revived.\
  \ She had been a dull child before, but after this accident became lively and intelligent\
  \ and grew up so\u2019. Lyme was already conscious of its proximity to the past;\
  \ a local fishmonger displayed million-year-old fishes on the slab among the day's\
  \ catch, while Mr Anning himself was an established fossil hunter, often no doubt\
  \ bringing back to his shop the fragments of reptilian spines which were familiar\
  \ enough to have acquired the local name of \u2018Verterberries\u2019. From very\
  \ early years Mary went with him to the cliffs, and when he died, she carried on\
  \ the trade because she and her family needed the money. In 1811\u2026 this twelve-year-old\
  \ girl found the first complete ichthyosaur\u2026 in another two years she had uncovered\
  \ the first flying reptile or pterodactyl. Perhaps her own favourite was a baby\
  \ plesiosaur.\nThis struck me as a fascinating tale\u2014the baby struck by lightning\
  \ who thereafter transcends her humble background (though she remained poor) by\
  \ making discoveries that fundamentally altered our understanding of prehistory.\
  \ The first person to exhume a pterodactyl! I decided then and there to make Mary\
  \ Anning\u2014of whom I had never heard before\u2014the subject of one of my daily\
  \ essays. And so, today being the day allotted to her, I was somewhat astonished\
  \ to note that she was also the subject of today's random article on the front page\
  \ of the Wikipedia.\n\u201CMy oh my, what a coincidence!\u201D, I said to myself.\
  \ Actually, I said it aloud, to Pansy Cradledew, who agreed that it was a startling\
  \ example of synchronicity. Unfortunately, her use of this term led us to a brief\
  \ discussion of the works of Gordon Sumner, who had something to say about synchronicity\
  \ in the years before he turned his attention to playing the lute and having Tantric\
  \ sex with Trudie Styler. To paraphrase H P Lovecraft, the most merciful thing in\
  \ the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to contemplate the doings\
  \ of Gordon Sumner for more than twenty seconds. After that, at least within my\
  \ cranium, there is a sort of automatic shutdown.\nWhen I came to, I pondered whether\
  \ to calculate the probability of the Mary Anning hoo-hah. There must be millions\
  \ of articles on the Wikipedia, and I assume the daily random one is selected by\
  \ some sort of robotic algorithm. My reading of A Land was occasioned by a recent\
  \ article about it in the Grauniad, allied with the fact that I had a copy of it,\
  \ a 1959 Pelican edition, inherited from my father. It is a book I have been familiar\
  \ with all my life, or rather, I have always been familiar with its spine\u2014\
  just as Mary Anning was familiar with her father's collection of reptilian spines\u2014\
  on my father's bookshelves and then on my own. Until I read the Grauniad piece,\
  \ though, I do not think I had ever opened it. There does appear to be something\
  \ inexplicably woohoohoodiwoo about the coincidence.\nIf I had the cast of mind\
  \ of a primitive savage, or a New Age airhead, I might be tempted to delve into\
  \ the possible significance of l'affaire Mary Anning, as I am beginning to think\
  \ of it. Is her shade attempting to contact me from beyond the grave? Am I being\
  \ coaxed into a study of pterodactyls? Which other neglected books from my father's\
  \ collection should I at long last take down from the bookshelf and actually read?\
  \ Such questions could keep a fool's brain occupied for aeons, or at least until\
  \ bedtime.\nInstead, I found myself thinking about the millions of articles on the\
  \ Wikipedia, and how, today at least, Hooting Yard and the Wikipedia are as one.\
  \ We both train our beady eyes on Mary Anning. It is true that the Wikipedia has\
  \ rather more to say about her, and might be the preferred website for spotty urchins\
  \ who, charged with writing a school self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity hub essay\
  \ entitled What It Feels Like To Be Struck By Lightning And Discover A Fossilised\
  \ Pterodactyl, hasten to copy and paste swathes of text so they need neither think\
  \ nor work. (That all too typical essay title, incidentally, would only encourage\
  \ them to \u201Cfeel\u201D, rather than to think. History teaching nowadays appears\
  \ to be a branch of the \u201Cjourney\u201D undergone by weeping contestants on\
  \ lack-of-talent shows. Imagine you are a victim of oppression by cold heartless\
  \ empire-builders wearing pith helmets. How do you feel? OMG it's been an incredible\
  \ journey, innit.) But while the Wikipedia may be more informative than Hooting\
  \ Yard, strictly speaking, here the reader will find a slightly different angle\
  \ of approach, no less valuable in its way.\nAnd then the further thought occurs\
  \ that perhaps I ought to strive to replace, or at least complement, the Wikipedia,\
  \ by writing a matching piece for all its millions of articles. Of course I would\
  \ by no means allow other \u201Cusers\u201D to edit my work. We don't want the hoi\
  \ polloi and the ignoramuses to come paddling in our pond, do we? But slowly, gradually,\
  \ Hooting Yard could become the default reference source on the interweb. I must\
  \ draw up a schedule, a plan of campaign. I could simply write about whatever subject\
  \ is the Wikipedia's random article of the day, but it might be better to tackle\
  \ topics in some order of priority. That way, I can safely place until the very\
  \ last, after I have addressed millions of other subjects, \u201CSumner, Gordon\_\
  : this page is intentionally blank\u201D.\n[2012-05-21]"
