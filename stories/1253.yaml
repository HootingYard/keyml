text: "Having spilled soup on a piece of cambric, the verger tried to amend his sloppiness\
  \ by dabbing at the cambric with a damp sponge. Alas, so much chemical colourant\
  \ had been added to the soup, which was of a tomato flavour, and so hastily and\
  \ violently did the verger do his dabbing, that a bright orange stain was impressed\
  \ into the cambric. The cambric, by the way, was blue with golden stars, like the\
  \ vault of heaven. Fearing that he had ineradicably besmirched a representation\
  \ of the ethereal realm, the verger hid the cambric and the sponge in a cupboard\
  \ and poured the remainder of his tomato soup down the drain. He cleansed his bowl\
  \ and spoon with more care than he had dabbed at the cambric, and placed them exactly\
  \ where he had found them among the crockery and cutlery, having first dried them\
  \ with a tea towel depicting the martyrdom of Saint Anselm. This was an historically\
  \ inaccurate tea towel, as Saint Anselm died a natural death rather than being martyred\
  \ for his faith. It was not the only erroneous tea towel in the kitchen.\nThe verger\
  \ hoped that hiding the evidence of his sloppiness in the cupboard would prevent\
  \ it from coming to light, but he reckoned without the involvement of Detective\
  \ Captain Cargpan. The detective was called in by the bishop on an unrelated matter,\
  \ something to do with the local sniper, who had been taking potshots at the cathedral\
  \ hens. Cargpan was noted for his energetic approach to police work, and on this\
  \ occasion he strained so many sinews that by midmorning he was exhausted and dehydrated.\
  \ Characteristically, he did not whimper to the bishop begging for refreshments,\
  \ but instead blundered about until he found the kitchen, where he intended to gulp\
  \ down water straight from the tap. Having done enough gulping to make himself feel\
  \ human again, Cargpan could not resist opening all the drawers and cupboards in\
  \ the kitchen and examining the contents with his magnifying glass.. Such was his\
  \ method. Although it was unlikely that either the sniper or the hens had ever been\
  \ in the kitchen, the detective assumed nothing. Thus it was that he discovered\
  \ the hidden cambric and sponge. He was extremely suspicious of the bright orange\
  \ stain.\nUnder questioning, the verger admitted his part, but insisted that the\
  \ sponge and the cambric had no connection to the sniper and the hens. Detective\
  \ Captain Cargpan roughed him up a bit, breaking one of his arms and dislocating\
  \ his jaw. This, too, was his method. The verger continued to protest his innocence\
  \ throughout his subsequent trial and the long years on the prison hulk moored off\
  \ an unspeakable stretch of coastline. Long after his death, campaigners sought\
  \ for him a posthumous pardon. But we now know that Cargpan was right all along,\
  \ and that the verger and the sniper were one and the same. Interviewed for a television\
  \ documentary during his long and happy retirement, Cargpan explained that, for\
  \ him, it was an open and shut case.\n\u201CA man who can smear tomato soup upon\
  \ a picture of the vault of heaven, and who makes use of historically erroneous\
  \ tea towels, is precisely the sort of man who would shoot at innocent clucking\
  \ hens with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle,\u201D he said. Today we are at last able\
  \ to acknowledge the wisdom of those words.\n[2008-12-30]"
