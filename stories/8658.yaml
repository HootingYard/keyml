text: "One of the most memorable incidents in my childhood took place in the Newty\
  \ Field. If I am to be wholly accurate, I would have to amend that to say it took\
  \ place within my head. It was a dream, but so vivid a dream that for many years\
  \ I insisted it had really happened. Reluctantly, I eventually conceded that the\
  \ whole thing was phantasmal. For one thing, my older brother, who was \u201Cthere\u201D\
  \ with me, had absolutely no memory of it. Also, on reflection, I had to admit the\
  \ preposterousness of it as a real event. For all that, it stayed with me, and still\
  \ does, and I can picture the scene as clearly as I did more than forty years ago.\n\
  You will be pleased to learn, though, that the Newty Field itself was all too real.\
  \ Alas, I use the past tense, as it was long ago covered over with concrete and\
  \ council houses. It was a patch of neglected woodland, overgrown and pitted with\
  \ ponds, on the edge of the estate where I grew up. That being so, it was the natural\
  \ destination for children otherwise confined to a bleak grey postwar suburban council\
  \ estate with no other redeeming features I can recall. In the oiky parlance of\
  \ that time and place, the \u2018T\u2019 in \u2018Newty\u2019 was never pronounced,\
  \ so strictly speaking it was known as the New'ee Field.\nIt was not a field, as\
  \ such. I suppose there must have been newts in the ponds, as well as sticklebacks\
  \ and other such aquatic beings curiously beloved of children.\nThe one, dream,\
  \ incident has overshadowed any other memories of time spent in the Newty Field.\
  \ I cannot recall how often I used to go there, with whom, or what we did when we\
  \ were there. I was never one for climbing trees, nor for collecting aquatic beings\
  \ in a net. I suspect I enjoyed myself in the sort of aimless, dawdling, mucking\
  \ about that used to keep children occupied in the days before television and computer\
  \ games, and before paranoia about predatory paedophiles restricted children's ability\
  \ to roam without purpose. Perhaps countryside children still experience that kind\
  \ of freedom. One reason the Newty Field has lingered in my memory, and my imagination,\
  \ is that it was the closest thing to \u201Ccountryside\u201D accessible to me.\
  \ Slap bang next to the estate, small enough not to become hopelessly lost, yet\
  \ big enough to convince yourself that you were out in the wilderness. In trees\
  \ and ponds and tangled bracken and clumps of thorns and nettles. As I write this,\
  \ I realise that the Newty Field itself, at least as I remember it, is the fount\
  \ and origin of what we might call the Hooting Yard landscape. A faintly squalid,\
  \ sordid place, rather than one of bucolic beauty. A place where one squelches through\
  \ muck rather than gambols in the sunlight.\nSo to my dream. My brother and I were\
  \ pootling around in the Newty Field one grey autumnal day. It was late afternoon.\
  \ I was about seven years old, he ten. All of a sudden, we were accosted by a little\
  \ ganglet of boys, of similar ages to ourselves, none of whom we had ever seen before.\
  \ They formed a circle around us, and I felt trapped and fearful. That it was a\
  \ dream becomes obvious when I add that each of the boys had red hair, each was\
  \ identically dressed in a bright green jumper, and each was armed with a catapult.\
  \ It is rather like a skewed vision of the seven dwarves. The contrast of the red\
  \ hair and the green jumpers was startling. Each had loaded his catapult with a\
  \ stone or pebble. In spite of the fact that they looked almost identical, there\
  \ was a clear leader among them, and he now spoke, though not before raising and\
  \ aiming his catapult at us as if ready to shoot.\n\u201CStay here and don't dare\
  \ move,\u201D he said, \u201CWe'll be back.\u201D\nAnd then they were gone, dispersing\
  \ quickly into the trees. My brother and I stood, trembling and frightened, for\
  \ some minutes before we decided the boys were not going to return. We ran home,\
  \ a journey of no more than five minutes, completely unharmed, safe and sound. I\
  \ have no memory of telling my parents what had happened.\nLater, I suppose because\
  \ it was preying on my mind, I did talk about it. It seemed so real to me that I\
  \ think there must have come a point where the dream became a \u201Ctrue\u201D memory.\
  \ It was at this stage that my brother disclaimed all knowledge of what I was babbling\
  \ on about, and I think my parents received the story with a sort of world-weary\
  \ ho-hum acceptance before finding something more interesting to divert their attention.\
  \ It was only in my teenage years, I recall, that the penny eventually dropped and\
  \ I realised the whole episode had only ever taken place inside my sleeping head.\n\
  I don't doubt that a brain-quack could have a (newty) field day analysing the dream\
  \ and my vivid memory of it, still surviving after almost half a century. Of more\
  \ interest to me is the realisation, today, of the place the Newty Field occupies\
  \ in my imagination.\nAs an addendum, I thought I would search for \u201CNewty Field\u201D\
  \ on Google. It was pleasing to note that it is one of those phrases, I forget the\
  \ name for them, which yields only a single result.\n\nI was even more pleased to\
  \ discover that this single result is, in itself, inaccurate, and refers to the\
  \ phrase \u201Cnewly returfed field\u201D.\n\nBut now I have given the Newty Field\
  \ its rightful place in history, and in future Google will lead those searching\
  \ for it to this very piece. I wonder if, among the searchers, will be a red-haired\
  \ middle-aged man, dressed in a green jumper, thinking nostalgic thoughts of his\
  \ six little pals, and their loaded catapults, and the two little boys they accosted\
  \ on an overcast late afternoon in the 1960s, in the Newty Field?\n[2012-03-14]"
