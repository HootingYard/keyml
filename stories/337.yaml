text: 'Dear Frank, writes Daniel Tomasch from Washington DC, Behold! Whilst I was
  rummaging through some old junk, I stumbled upon these copies of pamphlets by the
  out-of-print-pamphleteer Dobson. The trouser and Googie Withers pamphlets appear
  to be original first editions, while the bird pamphlet, unfortunately, appears to
  be an unauthorized reprint (which is now out of print.)




  Daniel says he will search further in his attic-of-surprises to see if any more
  examples of Dobsonia come to light. Many thanks to him for sharing these exceedingly
  rare items.
