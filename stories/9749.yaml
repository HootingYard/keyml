text: "Many thanks to Futility Closet for this clipping from The Times, 9 May 1854:\n\
  An accident, the consequences of which are expected to be fatal, took place at Cannes\
  \ on Sunday last. A M. Despleschin, of Nice, had announced his intention of making\
  \ an ascent in a balloon, and two gentlemen, M. Hardy, of Cannes, and M.A. de Sorr,\
  \ a literary man from Paris, had made arrangements to accompany him. These two gentlemen\
  \ had taken their seats in the car, M. Despleschin not having yet entered it, when\
  \ some person in the crowd, anxious to see the balloon start, cried out \u2018Let\
  \ go.\u2019 The man who held the ropes, thinking that the order had come from the\
  \ aeronaut, obeyed, and the balloon rose rapidly into the clouds, and disappeared.\
  \ M. Hardy and M. de Sorr are both entirely ignorant of the management of a balloon,\
  \ and it is feared that they have been carried out to sea. Up to the 2d. no intelligence\
  \ had been received of them.\n[2012-07-27]"
