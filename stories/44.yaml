text: "There is another flurry of outrage, in Cambridge this time, because someone\
  \ has published a picture of a seventh-century mystic. Apparently, it is absolutely\
  \ forbidden to draw pictures of \u201Cthe prophet Mohammed\u201D, as the mystic\
  \ is known. (I worry about that definite article, as I'm sure there have been other\
  \ prophets from time to time.) Back in September 2006 (scroll down to Blodgett's\
  \ Jihad) we published a picture of this fellow, and it seems like a good idea to\
  \ reprint it now, if only to remind readers just how outrageous such depictions\
  \ are. When you have stopped quaking with fury\u2014and outrage, of course\u2014\
  you can go and read this.\n\n[2007-02-12]"
