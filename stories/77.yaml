  \ she was so often engaged in thrilling adventures, which usually involved kicking\
  \ someone's head in, she did not always find it easy to lull herself to sleep. As\
  \ this rare picture shows, she was as resourceful a girl when it came to naps as\
  \ she was when bashing up Prince Fulgencio's evil henchmen.\n\nSuspension Chloriforeene\
