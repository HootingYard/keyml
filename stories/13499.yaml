  \ about yesterday, is reviewed on the Paris Review website. Well, sort of reviewed.\
  \ The author confesses he had never heard of Christopher Smart before, and devotes\
  \ the bulk of his piece to a summary of Mr Key's essay on Jubilate Agno. I added\
  \ a comment directing readers to the audio recording at the Internet Archive. Sooner\
  \ or later, Germander Speedwell and I are going to \u201Cgo viral\u201D, I am sure\
  \ of it.\n[2014-11-19]"
