text: "[With thanks to Banished To A Pompous Land.]\nIt was a stark and doomy night;\
  \ the rain fell in torrents\u2014except at occasional intervals, when it was checked\
  \ by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in Pointy Town\
  \ that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the\
  \ scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.\nBy the light of\
  \ one such scanty flame, had we a view of the scene, we might have spotted, prancing\
  \ along the windswept street, muffled in a stylish Piet Van Der Groot greatcoat,\
  \ that titan among cultural theorists, Jean-Luc Git. Slung around his shoulder was\
  \ a satchel, and in the satchel was a copy, hot off the press, of his latest book.\
  \ Did I say book? It was not a word Git used. He called it a texte or a (dis)course,\
  \ of course. On this stark and doomy night he was on his way through the gusty streets\
  \ of Pointy Town to read selections from his texte or (dis)course to a tavern full\
  \ of intoxicated intellectuals.\nThey were intoxicated both by booze and by ideas,\
  \ and nobody had better ideas than Jean-Luc Git. So the tavern's hubbub was stilled,\
  \ and there was an expectant hush, as the cultural theorist came crashing through\
  \ the door. Without removing his stylish greatcoat, he crossed to the low stage\
  \ where a lectern had been placed. Next to the lectern was a table on which stood\
  \ a small glass containing a spiritous liquor of vivid hue. Git swigged it, took\
  \ his texte or (dis)course out of the satchel, opened it on the lectern, and began\
  \ to declaim.\nFor half an hour or so, everything went tickety-boo. Git recited\
  \ his clogged impenetrable prose and the intellectuals furrowed their brows, nodded\
  \ sagely, and tugged at their goatees. But then the cultural theorist said:\n\u201C\
  \u2026 and so, in what we might call the helix of disengagement, we interrogate\
  \ notions of structure, unstructure, dis-structure, mis-structure, and ur-structure\
  \ by way of an investigation, doubly incoherent, both formal and informal, of the\
  \ punctum of jouissance \u2026\u201D\nFrom somewhere in the audience, there was\
  \ a titter, which turned to a chortle, and very soon became a guffaw. It was followed\
  \ by a heckle, couched in language so unseemly it is not fit for family reading.\
  \ Git was stopped in his tracks.\n\u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D he shouted.\n\u201C\
  You heard what I said,\u201D replied the heckler.\n\u201CHow dare you impugn my\
  \ jouissance!\u201D cried Git.\nBut it was as if the occasional violent gusts of\
  \ winds which swept up the streets of Pointy Town had come blowing into the tavern,\
  \ as if the torrents of rain on this stark and doomy night had come flooding in.\
  \ In the tumult, the cultural theorist's jouissance proved no defence. He was undone.\n\
  Discussion points for your reading group.\nWhat is a just course of action if as\
  \ a cultural theoretician one's jouissance is impugned?.\nList the personality defects\
  \ of the kind of barbarian who would impugn the jouissance of a figure as titanic\
  \ as Jean-Luc Git.\nUsing scissors and cardboard, make a paper dolly dressed in\
  \ a Piet Van Der Groot greatcoat.\nWhich tavern in Pointy Town do you think would\
  \ be so irresponsible as to allow entry to a barbarian so culturally depraved that\
  \ they would heckle Jean-Luc Git?\nDo you think the \u201Cscanty flame\u201D from\
  \ the lamps that struggle against the darkness is symbolic of Jean-Luc Git's jouissance?\n\
  Sag\u2019 mir, wo die Blumen sind?\n[2013-05-14]"
