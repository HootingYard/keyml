text: "Speaking of drayhorses, as we were yesterday, I could not help but notice that\
  \ the phrase \u201CGit on drayhorse\u201D is an anagram of \u201CHooting Yarders\u201D\
  . This has the vexing implication that my average reader or listener is a git mounted\
  \ on a drayhorse. One pictures a rustic lane along which a great grey drayhorse\
  \ is plodding, atop which is a git, leafing through a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio,\
  \ Rectitude & Pippy Bags perhaps, or listening to my radio show on a pair of headphones\
  \ jammed into their gitty ears.\nNow I do not wish to think of any Hooting Yard\
  \ devotee as a git. Perhaps what we have here is akin to that phenomenon where otherwise\
  \ staid and reasonable persons turn into psychotic maniacs when they get behind\
  \ the driving wheel of a car. Does the placid and altogether lovely Hooting Yarder\
  \ become a git at the moment of plopping in to the saddle of their great grey drayhorse?\
  \ I suppose it is possible.\nAnagrammatic determinism being what it is, all I can\
  \ do is to plead with my readers and listeners to find for themselves an alternative\
  \ means of pulling their carts along the country lanes. Many of you will, I know,\
  \ be toiling along those very lanes today, engarbed in peasant rags, transporting\
  \ your carts piled high with rustic muck from one filthy field to another, or perhaps\
  \ rolling in to a market square at the centre of a squalid hamlet. And what better\
  \ way to pass the time, as the wind howls through the branches of larches and pines,\
  \ than to read a tale from Befuddled By Cormorants or to listen on your iHoot to\
  \ a morally instructive episode of Hooting Yard On The Air? But doing so need not,\
  \ must not, make you a git. So eschew your drayhorse, I beg of you, and if you cannot\
  \ afford a fume-belching tractor, pull the damned cart yourself.\n[2011-01-21]"
