text: "\nThis week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I offer some handy tips on etiquette.\
  \ Those of you likely to encounter, over the weekend, black-hearted Prince Fulgencio\
  \ and/or grunting farmyard pigs will find this advice particularly helpful. As far\
  \ as I know I do not have an appointment with the prince, nor with any pigs, but\
  \ I ought to check my day-book to make absolutely sure.\nMy day-book, by the way,\
  \ has a yellow cover, like a fin de si\xE8cle symbolist publication, whereas the\
  \ cover of my night-book is as black as the black, black heart of Prince Fulgencio.\
  \ Indeed, the precise shade of black was created by replicating, to the nth degree,\
  \ the blackness at the heart of the prince's black heart, as depicted in the official\
  \ mezzotints.\nA dumb bear loomed over the shoulder of the mezzotintist as he worked,\
  \ as dumb bears do in certain tales, ones you have probably forgotten, for you did\
  \ not pay proper attention when sat at your mother's knee as she read to you, about\
  \ dumb bears and mezzotintists and the black, black heart of Prince Fulgencio, from\
  \ those dog-eared storybooks, so many years ago. All the illustrations in the book\
  \ had been torn out and used as makeshift wallpaper for the bomb shelter.\nOh! it\
  \ was the loveliest of bomb shelters, lovely and subterranean, and before the wallpaper\
  \ was pasted up the walls clanged when you rapped them with your tiny fists. Since\
  \ then, worms have eaten their way through the walls, huge wriggling toxic albino\
  \ worms like something from a nightmare. It is said by some that such worms gnawed\
  \ their way into Prince Fulgencio's black heart, while he yet lived, and that was\
  \ what made him so terrible and terrifying a prince. But that did not stand up in\
  \ court, nor in the star chamber.\nI keep my night-book in my star chamber, and\
  \ my day-book in the pantry. Oh! It is the loveliest of pantries, lovely and subterranean\
  \ and filled with jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar\
  \ after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar and a jelly\
  \ jug for jugged jelly.\n\n[2014-08-29]"
