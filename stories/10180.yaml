text: "Panjandrum, The Great. The term applied to a country worthy who fills every\
  \ public office available in a village. It was a word invented by Samuel Foote in\
  \ a string of rigmarole as a test for the memory of Macklin, the actor. Macklin\
  \ had boasted that he could remember anything he had read once. Foote wrote this:\n\
  \u201CSo she went into the garden to cut a cabbage leaf to make an apple pie, and\
  \ at the same time a great she-bear came running up the street and popped its head\
  \ into the shop. \u2018What! No soup?\u2019 So he died, and she\u2014very imprudently\u2014\
  married the barber. And there were present the Picninnies, the Joblilies, the Guryulies,\
  \ and the Great Panjandrum himself, with the little Red Button a'top and they all\
  \ fell to playing the game of catch-catch-can till the gunpowder ran out of the\
  \ heels of their boots.\u201D\nMacklin, in a fury, refused to repeat a word of it.\n\
  \u2013 from Encyclopaedia Of Phrases And Origins by Edwin Radford, Editor, \u201C\
  Live Letters\u201D of the Daily Mirror , Eighth & Cheap Impression, 1950.\n\nFrankly,\
  \ it is difficult to see what Macklin, the actor, was getting in a tizzy about.\
  \ Perhaps he was just having a thespian moment. He was, after all, a tempestuous\
  \ character who killed a fellow actor, Thomas Hallam, by thrusting a cane through\
  \ his eye during an argument about a wig. The cane went straight though Hallam's\
  \ eye into his brain. Accused of murder, Macklin defended himself at his trial and\
  \ was convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter, for which he ought to have\
  \ had his hand branded with the letter \u2018M\u2019, though it is unclear if the\
  \ penalty was carried out. When he died at the age of 98 in 1797, his memorial tablet\
  \ in St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, included a relief of a dagger piercing the\
  \ eye of a theatrical mask. Next time you are in London, you might want to dress\
  \ up as the Great Panjandrum, with the little Red Button a'top, and go and take\
  \ a look at it. I have not paid such a visit myself, partly because I do not think\
  \ ill-tempered roister-doister Irish thespians ought to be encouraged. Lord knows\
  \ there are enough of them, from Macklin in the eighteenth century to such as Richard\
  \ Harris in the twentieth.\nHad I been presented with Foote's rigmarole, I would\
  \ not have fallen into a fury, nor been tempted to pierce his brain with a cane\
  \ through the eye. Instead, I would have questioned him closely about the sources\
  \ of his story. You see, having done a certain amount of research into this kind\
  \ of rigmarole, I think Foote was actually reporting a real historical episode.\n\
  The difficulty lies in pinning down the identities of the unnamed \u201Cshe\u201D\
  , the fleeting, fugitive \u201Che\u201D who dies, and of course the Picninnies,\
  \ the Joblilies, and the Guryulies. The Great Panjandrum, we can assume, is Celtic\
  \ hothead Macklin. As for the barber, I have cobbled together a theory that this\
  \ was one Punchkin Lampwick, a murderous barber, well-known to members of the eighteenth\
  \ century theatrical profession, whose locks he chopped, and who was the real life\
  \ model for that Victorian bogeyman barber Sweeney Todd.\nUnfortunately for us,\
  \ Lampwick appears to have been bigamous as well as murderous. He had several wives\
  \ and more than several paramours, thus making identification of the \u201Cshe\u201D\
  \ who\u2014very imprudently\u2014married him a matter of conjecture. Could we trace\
  \ all those three hundred-year-old women, and say with certainty which one used\
  \ a cabbage leaf in their apple pie recipe, we would be on firmer ground. It may\
  \ be, of course, that a cabbage leaf was an essential ingredient in one particular\
  \ type of eighteenth century apple pie, in which case that firm ground would crumble\
  \ beneath us, leaving us dangling over a precipice. Such are the risks of historical\
  \ research.\nFurther and more intractable problems occur when we try to work out\
  \ who in heaven's name Foote was talking about when he refers to the Picninnies,\
  \ the Joblilies, and the Guryulies. Picninny\u2014more commonly given as Picaninny\u2014\
  is a word one deploys at one's peril these days, as Boris Johnson found to his cost.\
  \ Although a plain reading of his original text makes clear that the object of his\
  \ amused scorn was Tony Blair, nobody actually bothers with plain readings of original\
  \ texts when certain hand-grenade words are used. There will probably be some righteous\
  \ airheads who would prefer that I rendered it as P********, or as \u2018the P-word\u2019\
  . In whatever form we put it, we are unclear to whom precisely Foote was referring.\n\
  At least that word, with its added \u2018a\u2019, has survived, along with Panjandrum.\
  \ The same cannot be said for either Joblilies or Guryulies, neither of which I\
  \ have come across before. They would seem to have been born and died with Samuel\
  \ Foote and his rigmarole, no doubt leading to the misunderstanding that he was\
  \ writing nonsense. Of course, the idea of writing deliberate nonsense simply to\
  \ irritate an Irish thespian is an appealing one. Clearly it has inspired those\
  \ charged with writing scripts to be performed by Liam Neeson, for example.\nSo\
  \ I am afraid my theory regarding the factual basis of Foote's rigmarole is but\
  \ a fledgling. There is as yet so much I don't know. I don't know who these characters\
  \ are. I don't know what they want. If they are looking for fictional immortality,\
  \ I can tell them I don't have that gift. But what I do have are a very particular\
  \ set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make\
  \ me a nightmare for characters like them. If they let me cease this prattling now,\
  \ that'll be the end of it. I will not go on about them, I will not pursue my theory.\
  \ But if they don't, I will look for them, I will find them, and I will kill them.\n\
