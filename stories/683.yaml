text: "\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\nI have been wondering if it is time for Hooting Yard\
  \ to obtain a kitemark.\_ Readers from overseas will wonder what on earth I am babbling\
  \ about, so let me explain. Every single person in this country, man, woman and\
  \ child, upon seeing a little picture of a kite, knows viscerally that whatever\
  \ it is that the picture of a kite is attached to is an absolutely fantastic thing,\
  \ and they can confidently begin to drool with glee. Why this should be so is not\
  \ quite clear, but is probably bound up with age-old traditions of bureaucratic\
  \ twaddle.\nIt has its critics, of course, those in the reality-based community\
  \ who suggest there is something inane in the equation picture of a kite = gleeful\
  \ drooling. But we can only go on the evidence before us. I tested the Pavlovian\
  \ responses of passers-by in a bustling hamlet yesterday. First, I offered people\
  \ a string bag packed with oozing squelchy muck. There were no takers, and indeed\
  \ on more than one occasion I was clouted around the head or threatened by the attentions\
  \ of community hub vigilance officers. But then I made the same offer having stuck\
  \ a picture of a kite to the bag with Blu-Tac. The transformation was astonishing.\
  \ People began to openly drool in the streets, their glee uncontained, and several\
  \ grabbed at the bag full of muck until I had inadvertently created a mel\xE9e.\
  \ In the end I had to hide behind a piece of civic statuary, but my point was proved.\_\
