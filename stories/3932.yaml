text: "[This piece ought to have appeared on Tuesday. Mea culpa.]\nDobson adored Pancake\
  \ Day. Every year, in the weeks leading up to Shrove Tuesday, he grew ever more\
  \ hot-brained and excitable, gathering sacks of flour, carrying out repeated Orwellian\
  \ egg counts, and begging Old Farmer Frack for churns of milk from the mad old rustic's\
  \ cow collection. Every year, too, he revised, polished, embroidered, and sometimes\
  \ even rewrote from scratch his pamphlet Pancakes\_: Food Of The Gods? (out of print).\n\
  In the complete Dobson bibliography, this title appears both with and without that\
  \ question mark, like Sidney and Beatrice Webb's fatuous Soviet Communism\_: A New\
  \ Civilization?, written in 1935 at the height of Stalin's terror, which lost its\
  \ question mark between its first and second editions. Why Dobson ever phrased his\
  \ title as a query in the first place is unfathomable, for he was absolutely convinced\
  \ that all divine beings subsisted on pancakes and nothing else. A glance at any\
  \ sacred text or compendium of myths quickly disproves the pamphleteer's theory,\
  \ if we can call it that, though \u201Cdelusional id\xE9e fixe\u201D would express\
  \ it better. Dobson spent a preposterous amount of time working his way through\
  \ the foundational texts of all major religions, Tippexing out all mentions of foodstuffs\
  \ and, as soon as the Tippex was dry, scribbling in the word \u201Cpancakes\u201D\
  . At one point he commissioned Rex Tint, the noted mezzotintist, to create a mezzotint\
  \ showing the Greek gods atop Mount Olympus, stuffing their faces with pancakes.\
  \ The work was never completed, or even begun, because Dobson wanted to pay the\
  \ mezzotintist in eggs, flour, and milk, and Rex Tint, famously, was a \u201Ccash\
  \ only\u201D mezzotintist.\nIt comes as something of a surprise to learn that in\
  \ spite of his enthusiasm, Dobson was a hopeless pancake maker. He could never get\
  \ the mixture quite right, and his tossing technique was laughable. He tried to\
  \ divert attention from his pancake ineptitude through a combination of bluster,\
  \ weeping, and pointing out of the window at an imaginary flock of chaffinches.\
  \ Only late in his life did he face up to the truth, in the remarkable pamphlet\
  \ My Pancake Ineptitude\_: A Heart-Rending Confession In Sixteen Bursts Of Hallucinatory\
  \ Prose (out of print). In the sixteenth and final text, Dobson makes his most compelling\
  \ case for the divine nature of this simple aliment, although the prose is so hallucinatory\
  \ that not even the most diligent, pancake-focused reader can work out what in heaven's\
  \ name he is babbling on about.\nADDENDUM\_: A better, and more accurate title than\
  \ Soviet Communism\_: A New Civilization would have been Soviet Communism\_: Enemy\
  \ Of Orchards, as Michael Gilleland at Laudator Temporis Acti reminds us.\n[2010-02-18]"
