  This week in The Dabbler I conduct a long-overdue inquiry into the death of Virginia
  Woolf. If everything goes according to plan, this should be the first in a series
  of inquiries into the deaths of the great modernists, a necessary step, surely,
  into any proper understanding of postmodernism. I have convinced myself that, once
  I fully grasp every last little detail of the deaths of the modernists, I will be
  in a much better position to winkle some meaning out of the endless clogged blather
  of standard po-mo prose. Some would say it is not worth the effort, and they are
  probably correct, so perhaps I ought to put the whole project into a dustbin or
  wastepaper basket. What a quandary!
