text: "In a poem she scribbled on the back of a letter to a friend in 1855, the Pre-Raphaelite\
  \ Muse Lizzie Siddall wrote:\nThe voices of a thousand birds / That clang above\
  \ my head, / Shall bring me to a sadder dream / When this sad dream is dead.\nA\
  \ freakish loon by the name of Wilf Birdclang\u2014methinks he changed his name\
  \ by deed poll\u2014has spent the last fifteen years identifying and cataloguing\
  \ the thousand different types of bird that make a clanging sound. It would not\
  \ surprise me if you raised your eyebrows at that sentence, an inner voice exclaiming\
  \ \u201Cwhat fresh nonsense is this?\u201D You are probably of the conviction that\
  \ few, if any, birds go \u201Cclang\u201D, and certainly not a thousand different\
  \ types. You might also be thinking to yourself that Lizzie Siddall did not suggest\
  \ that her clangers were anything but a thousand birds all of the same type. Granted,\
  \ she does not specify, but I think sheer common sense indicates that she had just\
  \ one type of bird in mind. What that bird may have been she does not say, thus\
  \ allowing the likes of Wilf Birdclang to step in with his ludicrous list.\nThe\
  \ point about his fifteen years\u2019 work is that it is all bluster and assertion,\
  \ without a trace of evidence or argument. For example, the first bird on Wilf's\
  \ list is the starling. He writes:\n1. The starling. Starlings make loud, even deafening,\
  \ clanging noises.\nAny ornithologist of repute will tell you that this is complete\
  \ drivel. Indeed, I am an ornithologist of repute, and I am telling you it is drivel.\
  \ I have come across any number of starlings in my time, and not one of them has\
  \ clanged, ever, deafeningly or otherwise.\nWilf Birdclang has now set to work on\
  \ a list of a thousand sad dreams. Let us hope it proves more rigorous than his\
  \ birdy twaddle.\n[2009-08-11]"
