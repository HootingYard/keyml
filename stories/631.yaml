text: "I attended a seminar recently which had the jaunty title \u201CComments Policies\
  \ For Bloggers\_: How To Make Them Harsh And Unforgiving\u201D. It was all very\
  \ tiresome, and the \u201Cfacilitator\u201D, as he insisted on calling himself,\
  \ in spite of the fact that the facilities were woeful, had little understanding\
  \ of a blog such as Hooting Yard. Here, the prose is defiantly sensible and the\
  \ comments more sensible still.\nIt struck me, however, that I have never made the\
  \ Hooting Yard Comments Policy clear. I will do so now. New visitors may not be\
  \ aware that reading the comments here is compulsory, and is due to be enforced\
  \ by an exciting\u2014if somewhat alarming\u2014software device. If, in future,\
  \ you do not click on the comments, your computer will be disabled, your tongue\
  \ will cleave to the roof of your mouth, your hovel will be infested with pale mutant\
  \ creeping things, and you will no longer receive visits from outreach workers from\
  \ your local Harsh And Unforgiving Community Outreach Cadet Squadron.\nI have taken\
  \ this step to ensure that readers do not miss such treats as the discussion of\
  \ pippy bags to be found here, or\u2014to pluck just one of numerous profundities\u2014\
  wst's emotionally wrenching comment on The Roads To Jaywick.\nMoves are afoot to\
  \ make the writing, as well as the reading, of comments equally compulsory, but\
  \ the boffins in the software lab have all gone on a well-deserved autumn break\
  \ to the eerie Land of Gaar.\n[2008-09-26]"
