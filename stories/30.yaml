  \ You can help the station remain on air by sponsoring next week's Hooting Yard\
  \ On The Air show, to be broadcast (live as ever) at 4.00 PM on Wednesday 14 February.\
  \ Here is how it works:\n1. Go to Resonance and donate a minimum of \xA35.\n2. You\
  \ may now choose a sentence, a phrase, a string of words, or a name to be incorporated\
  \ into a specially-written story which will feature on next week's show.\n3. Send\
  \ your chosen words to me at hooting.yard@googlemail.com, and voila!, it's as simple\
  \ as that.\n4. After reading the story, I will recite the names of the donors (unless\
  \ anonymity is preferred).\n5. Now follow Step 1, immediately!\n[2007-02-06]"
