text: "Apropos of crow and hare oracles, R., in a comment, takes me to task for being\
  \ cavalier about the precise nature of the rug upon which one's cards are dealt\
  \ and pebbles scattered, and asks for\u2014or rather demands\u2014a rug reading\
  \ list. It pains me to suggest that such a request merely demonstrates R.'s lack\
  \ of attunement with the esoteric spheres. It also reminds me that the old fraud\
  \ G I Gurdjieff began life as a travelling rug salesman. As how could he not? For\
  \ his trade is hidden in his name. Take the first three letters, reverse them, and\
  \ voila!, \u201CGur\u201D becomes \u201CRug\u201D. Thus we see how human destinies\
  \ can, sometimes, be inscribed in our being.\nI think it no accident, either, that\
  \ my correspondent R. shares an initial with the subset of floor covering types\
  \ he is getting all worked up about. I do not use the phrase \u201Cworked up\u201D\
  \ lightly, for of course it reminds us of \u201CThe Work\u201D about which Gurdjieff\
  \ babbled and wrote for much of his preposterous life. I wonder if R. would be driving\
  \ himself to the same level of hysteria had I recommended dealing the cards and\
  \ scattering the pebbles upon a mat, or even upon linoleum.\nIn addition, may I\
  \ advise R. to be careful what he wishes for? A cursory reading of the medical literature\
  \ warns us against becoming fumous-brained about floor coverings such as rugs, mats,\
  \ and especially carpets. Quite literally, that way madness lies!\n\n[2009-06-18]"
