text: "This morning, at an ungodly hour, I began to read The Spectacles Of Mr Cagliostro\
  \ by Harry Stephen Keeler. Almost five years ago, I wrote briefly on these pages\
  \ about Keeler, so it behooves me to drag that postage out of the archives and draw\
  \ it to your attention. This is what I had to say, including my rather shamefaced\
  \ note at the end:\nReader Tim Drage has drawn my attention to the pulp novelist\
  \ Harry Stephen Keeler, and I am smitten. I think you will be too. Go and visit\
  \ the Harry Stephen Keeler Society, try to ignore the rather breathless tone (the\
  \ site's author is overfond of exclamation marks!!)*, and discover for yourself\
  \ this writer who has already been given a posthumous Big Tin Medal by the Hooting\
  \ Yard Sainthood Committee. Here is what to expect:\n\u201CIn The Man With the Magic\
  \ Eardrums (1939), a bookie and a safecracker run into each other in a house in\
  \ Minneapolis and spend the night talking. Oh yes, there are two phone calls, and\
  \ another character comes into the house and talks for a while. This takes hundreds\
  \ of pages. The direct action of The Portrait of Jirjohn Cobb (1940), which has\
  \ to be one of the most astoundingly unreadable novels ever written, consists of\
  \ four characters, two of whom sport outrageous accents, sitting on an island in\
  \ the middle of a river, talking and listening to a radio, again for hundreds of\
  \ pages. And these novels were only the first volumes of two multi-novel sequences!\
  \ \u2026 How about these chapter titles from The Bottle With the Green Wax Seal\
  \ (1942): The Chromatic Whimsicalness of Avunculi Samuelis; Synthetic Mexican; and\
  \ The Micro-Axially Condensed Typewriter.\u201D\n* NOTE\_: Richard Polt, author\
  \ of the site [and of the above extracts], writes to say: \u201CAs for my use of\
  \ exclamation marks, I can only plead corruption!\u2013by Keeler!\u2013himself!!\u201D\
  \ Having now spent a couple of days reading Keeler myself, this makes perfect sense!!!!\n\
