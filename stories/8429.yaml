text: "Perhaps the most neglected work of the Renaissance scholar Gabbitas Hatpinne,\
  \ the thousand-plus pages of Fons de luxuria (1549) have been newly translated as\
  \ The Wellspring Of Debauchery. This is a significant academic achievement, and\
  \ one which should rescue Hatpinne from the oblivion that beckoned. Few read him\
  \ in his lifetime, and in the four hundred years since his death those few have\
  \ dwindled still further. Indeed, his new translator, Desdemona Snodgrass, suggests\
  \ she may be the only person alive to have read Fons de luxuria in its entirety,\
  \ and even she admits there were several occasions when she nodded off and had to\
  \ go on a brisk hiking expedition in order to wake herself up so she could continue\
  \ with her important task.\nThe Wellspring Of Debauchery attempts, at great length,\
  \ to answer the question \u201Cdoes salacious knavery, untrammelled sauciness, and\
  \ inappropriate hobnobbing in sinks of vice lead, inescapably, to the excesses of\
  \ high debauch?\u201D I will not give away Hatpinne's conclusion here, for fear\
  \ you would use that as an excuse not to read the book yourself, and in the time\
  \ thus saved, you may be tempted to acts of salacious knavery and untrammelled sauciness\
  \ and inappropriate hobnobbing in sinks of vice. It is much better for your moral\
  \ fibre, and indeed for the fate of your immortal soul, that you have your head\
  \ stuck in a very fat book. It will keep you out of mischief.\nBut though I do not\
  \ wish to divulge the contents of this lengthy and by no means untedious work, it\
  \ is perhaps worth recalling the circumstances in which it came to be written. If\
  \ we have but world enough and time, we may even look into the circumstances in\
  \ which it came to be translated, here in the twenty-first century space age, but\
  \ let us not jump too far ahead of ourselves. In any case, Desdemona Snodgrass may\
  \ not want her motives to be inquired into too pointedly. She is a sensitive soul,\
  \ with many a skeleton stacked up in her closet, or so I have been told by perfidious\
  \ rumour-mongers and her rivals in the groves of academe. So even if we do have\
  \ time, we are not going to be discussing that episode with the siphon and the pastry\
  \ cases and the Chris De Burhg [sic] bootleg tape. I have taken legal advice and\
  \ I shall not be swayed.\nUnlike his translator, Gabbitas Hatpinne himself is safely\
  \ dead, and can be impugned without fear of litigation. Shall I therefore impugn\
  \ him? It would be easy enough to do, not because he lived a life of high debauch\
  \ and naughtiness, but because the likelihood is that you know nothing about him.\
  \ I could thus make up all sorts of stories about his salacious knavery and untrammelled\
  \ sauciness and inappropriate hobnobbing in sinks of vice, and you would soak them\
  \ all up, o! credulous reader. Tempting though it may be to wend my way down that\
  \ particular path to perdition, lined as it is by lightning-blasted pine trees and\
  \ shrivelled lupins and blighted potato patches, swept by fearsome gales and battered\
  \ by hailstones, patrolled by ravening wolves and stampeding half-starved bison,\
  \ it is a path I shall turn away from, in my prissy mincing morally upright manner,\
  \ I shall turn my eyes instead upon the glorious light shining atop the mountain\
  \ of saintliness and piety, and begin to clamber up towards the summit, there to\
  \ grasp in my unworthy paws the halo of virtue.\nYou see how, even without reading\
  \ The Wellspring Of Debauchery, I am become a model of sanctity? For it is indeed\
  \ the case that I have not been able to concentrate my mind on this hefty doorstopper\
  \ of a book, with its seemingly endless paragraphs of hectoring prose. I have better\
  \ things to do with my time, and, no, they do not involve salacious knavery and\
  \ untrammelled sauciness and inappropriate hobnobbing in sinks of vice. Would that\
  \ they did! I have occasionally wondered if I might abandon myself to a life of\
  \ high debauch. Though perhaps when I say \u201Coccasionally\u201D I ought truthfully\
  \ say \u201Coften\u201D. Indeed, just before sitting down at my escritoire to pen\
  \ these timeless words, I was weighing up in my overheated brain whether to contact\
  \ Desdemona Snodgrass and, under the guise of academic rigour, to seek an assignation\
  \ with her, in some leafy arbour, far from prying eyes, bent on sin. Fortunate indeed\
  \ that I averted the besmirchment of my soul by leaping from my escritoire and plunging\
  \ my head into a pail of icy water, and then embarking on a hike through the hills\
  \ in wind and rain, until such time as I had cooled my phantasmal ardour, and was\
  \ ready once more to sit, and to write, and to banish all thought of Desdemona Snodgrass\
  \ from my brain.\nNow, with regard to the circumstances in which The Wellspring\
  \ Of Debauchery was written, as I seem to recall that is what I was intending to\
  \ write about before I got carried away. We have only fragmentary details of the\
  \ biography of Gabbitas Hatpinne. We know neither the year of his birth nor the\
  \ year of his death. We do not know where he lived, nor what he lived on, and we\
  \ know nothing of his forebears or any progeny he may or may not have had. The sole\
  \ traces of him that survive are a few widely-dispersed and unreliable references\
  \ in fusty musty damp and dog-eared unauthorised documents found wedged in the walls\
  \ of crumbling parish churches. And such references as there are may well relate\
  \ to several different Gabbitases, several different Hatpinnes, and have nothing\
  \ whatsoever to do with our man.\nIt is all a great historical conundrum. The only\
  \ way it might be solved is if someone were to devote themselves to the research\
  \ required to write a proper biography. It is the sort of job ideally suited to,\
  \ let us pluck a name at random, Desdemona Snodgrass.\nI think I shall contact her\
  \ to suggest this course of action. I will arrange for us to meet, in a leafy arbour,\
  \ far from prying eyes, bent on scholarship, \_bent on sin.\n[2012-02-20]"
