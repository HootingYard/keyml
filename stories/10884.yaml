text: "The diary of a crow, on this day in 1970:\nWoke up in a foul temper. I was\
  \ really, really pissed off. Sat atop a tree and shouted my head off. I was still\
  \ pissed off but I went down to the car park to meet my crow pals. We strutted about,\
  \ intimidating smaller birds and indeed anybody else we came upon.\nLater I went\
  \ to sit atop a tree just outside Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Did\
  \ a bit of cawing. Spotted a bloke with a notepad and pen, who seemed to be jotting\
  \ down my caws. I wasn't having that, so I swooped down and had a quick slash at\
  \ his face with my talons.\n\u201CBy \u2018eck!\u201D he cried, \u201C'Appen you've\
  \ drawn blood, crow! Just like the first time I kissed my poor wife Sylvia, dead\
  \ by her own hand these seven years.\u201D\nThen he added \u201CBULLORGA OMBOLOM\
  \ FROR\u201D, in Real Orghast. I didn't realise darkness had opened its womb, but\
  \ looking round I saw night was falling, so I headed for a different tree and shouted\
  \ my head off for a while because I was still in a foul mood. Then I fell asleep.\n\
