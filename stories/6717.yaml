  \ curb. The way to avoid being slighted by bus drivers, waiters and salesgirls is\
  \ to be unselfish, self-confident, thoughtful, enthusiastic and happy. The way to\
  \ stop a long-winded speaker is for the chairman to rise, thank him for his splendid\
  \ contribution, and lead the audience in thunderous applause. The way to resist\
  \ a male seducer is for the lady to sit in an armless straight chair and pop a piece\
  \ of salt-water taffy into her mouth every time he is about to kiss her\u2026 The\
  \ way to keep matches dry in a row-boat is to put them in a fruit jar whose lid\
  \ has been fastened to the underside of the seat; to get at them, unscrew the jar\
  \ from the lid. The way to hem a circular flounce on a slipcover is too complicated\
  \ to go into here. The way to make a \u201CStradivarius\u201D violin is to do what\
  \ it tells you to do in You Can Make A \u201CStradivarius\u201D Violin, a publication\
  \ of Popular Mechanics Press. The way to raise the Devil is as follows: draw a circle\
  \ with consecrated coal and chalk and write around it, \u201CI forbid you, Lucifer,\
  \ on the name of the Blessed Trinity, to enter this circle\u201D; then take a stand\
  \ inside the circle and recite: \u201CI conjure thee, Lucifer, by the ineffable\
  \ names ON, ALPHA, YA, REY, SOL, MESSIAS, INGODUM that thou comest to do, without\
  \ harming me\u201D [you then tell him what you want]. Nota bene: this works only\
  \ on Mondays; on Tuesdays, for instance, Lucifer must be addressed as \u201CNAMBROTH\u201D\
  , on Saturdays as \u201CNABAM\u201D (Note to printer\_: no typos please, matter\
  \ of life and death) and on Sundays he will answer only to \u201CAQUIEL\u201D and\
  \ will ask for a hair of your head which on no account should be given him\u2014\
  he can be fooled with a hair from a fox.\nThe above useful information is a dipperful\
  \ from the great American reservoir of know-how\u2026\nThe R R Bowker Company publishes\
  \ How-To-Do-It Books\_: A Selected Guide, two hundred pages of descriptive bibliography\
  \ compiled by Robert E Kingery\u2026 Mr Kingery has cut a few paths through the\
  \ jungle of howtoism, culling out a mere 3,500 titles, which he has arranged under\
  \ nine hundred heads, from Abacus to Yoghurt, but traversing even these well-blazed\
  \ trails is fatiguing. Alcoholics, Allergy, and Alligators; Candle-Making and Candy-Making;\
  \ Chiggers and Children; Diving Boards and Divorce; Embroidery, Emotions, Enamelling,\
  \ Encyclopaedias, Entertaining, and Etching; Mental Illness cheek by jowl with Metalwork;\
  \ Money (Counterfeiting) cozying up to Money-Making Ideas; Survival (Atomic Bombs)\
  \ modulating into Swans. There are books on how to succeed as a motel operator,\
  \ a woman, a baby sitter, a committee member, a guest, a parent, a child, a lover,\
  \ a Chevrolet owner, and a baton twirler, (The Baton: Twirling Made Easy!) There\
  \ are howtos on encouraging bees and earthworms (Thomas J Barrett's Harnessing The\
  \ Earthworm) and on discouraging ants, budbugs, cockroaches, moths, silverfish,\
  \ and termites. There are howtos on pigeons and pigs and poker; on poultry, pregnancy,\
  \ printing, and poison ivy; on sleuthing and sleeping (How To Sleep Successfully);\
  \ on standing (Your Carriage Madam!, by Janet Lane) and sitting (Sitting Pretty\
  \ by, needless to say, the same author); on rabbits, rheumatism, riddles, rifles,\
  \ and rugs; on lace and lizards, lacrosse, and lampshades; on wood carving, meat\
  \ carving, soap carving, and ice carving; on how to make mobiles, be a widow (three\
  \ titles, including Donald I Rogers\u2019 Teach Your Wife To Be A Widow), and get\
  \ tall (Paul O'Neill's Why Be Short?); on how to collect books, bottles, buttons,\
  \ and butterflies; on how to buy things and even one book on how to throw things\
  \ away\u2014Morgan Towne's Treasures In Truck & Trash, which tells \u201Chow to\
  \ pick out the treasures from the junk in the cellar and attic, how much they are\
  \ worth, and where to sell them\u201D and which is by no means the only entry in\
  \ Mr Kingery's 3,500 that sounds as though it might really be quite useful in dealing\
  \ with one of the many special problems that bother people in this intricate age.\
  \ After all, it is not the fault of the howto author that modern life gets more\
  \ and more complicated, calling on him to settle problems that are more and more\
  \ arcane. One sometimes wonders, however, whether a feedback is not at work here\
  \ and whether a number of these problems would perhaps never have arisen to bother\
  \ us if books had not been written telling us how to solve them.\nDwight Macdonald,\
