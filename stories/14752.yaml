text: "I ought to explain why things have been so quiet at Hooting Yard of late. I\
  \ am beset by a case of diabetic retinopathy\u2014plus a Roth spot\u2014and my eyesight\
  \ is, quite frankly, pitiable. Typing and peering at a computer screen are rendered\
  \ somewhat laborious, and the effort required often results in general exhaustion\
  \ and debility. Hence the lack of sweeping paragraphs of majestic etc etc.\nBut\
  \ all is not lost! I shall shortly be commencing a series of monthly appointments\
  \ at the exciting-sounding Tuesday Injection Clinic in the ophthalmic department\
  \ of my local hospital. The Key eyes will be jabbed with needles each month until\
  \ such time as my sight returns to normal\u2014normal, for me of course, meaning\
  \ myopic, akin to a mole, but much better than it is now.\nIn the meantime I will\
  \ try to post here when able, and I look forward to resuming normal service before\
  \ too long.\n[2016-07-21]"
