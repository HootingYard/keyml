text: "From an obituary in the Telegraph:\n\u201CBill Millin, who died on August 17\
  \ aged 88, was personal piper to Lord Lovat on D-Day and piped the invasion forces\
  \ on to the shores of France; unarmed apart from the ceremonial dagger in his stocking,\
  \ he played unflinchingly as men fell all around him. Millin began his apparently\
  \ suicidal serenade immediately upon jumping from the ramp of the landing craft\
  \ into the icy water. As the Cameron tartan of his kilt floated to the surface he\
  \ struck up with Hieland Laddie. He continued even as the man behind him was hit,\
  \ dropped into the sea and sank. Once ashore Millin did not run, but walked up and\
  \ down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes\u2026\n\u201C[Later\u2026] Millin\
  \ was surprised not to have been shot, and he mentioned this to some Germans who\
  \ had been taken prisoner. They said that they had not shot at him because they\
  \ thought he had gone off his head.\u201D\nR.I.P.\n[2010-08-19]"
