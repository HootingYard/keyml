text: "Soviet Hen Coops is the latest bestseller by blockbuster paperbackist Pebblehead,\
  \ a sweeping and magisterial cross-cultural history of poultry under Communism.\
  \ On the face of it, this seems an unlikely subject for a book which has been flying\
  \ off the shelves of airport bookstalls and has, in the past week alone, earned\
  \ Pebblehead more money in royalties than J K Rowling has had hot dinners. But then,\
  \ in the hands of the potboilerist, the most unpromising material is handled with\
  \ such mastery and aplomb that, in places, it reads like the most nerve-wrenching\
  \ and nail-biting and heart attack-inducing of thrillers.\nSo I am told, in any\
  \ case, as I have not yet read it myself. A while ago, I set myself the task of\
  \ reading the entire Pebblehead canon, to date, in chronological order, and I do\
  \ not wish to cheat. Thus far I have reached the autumn of 1972 (Swarthy Fiends\
  \ In Dungeons Grim) and have a couple of hundred titles to get through before I\
  \ catch up with the latest tome. Thus I have relied on a specially-empanelled panel\
  \ of readers to report to me their responses to Soviet Hen Coops. In choosing the\
  \ panel, I was careful to exclude those with expert knowledge either of Soviet Communism\
  \ or of hens, for Pebblehead is nothing if not a populist, and it is the general\
  \ reader, and indeed the barely literate halfwit, for whom the bulk of his output\
  \ is intended.\nInitial reactions were overwhelmingly positive, with the panel giving\
  \ the book an overall rating of \u201CFantastic!\u201D. Converted into numerals,\
  \ this worked out as 10 out of 10, though a couple of panel members were keen to\
  \ go up to 11. As a sample of a detailed critique, I have plucked this from the\
  \ pile of written reports:\nHaving never read a Pebblehead book before, or indeed\
  \ any books at all, I was absolutely riveted to my armchair. Knowing nothing of\
  \ Russia and its satellite states in the years between 1917 and 1992, the whole\
  \ Communism thing was new to me, as was the stuff about poultry, for I have never\
  \ been near a hen coop in my life, suffering as I do from an allergy to bird feathers.\
  \ At times it was like reading an adventure story, or as I imagine it might be to\
  \ read an adventure story. I had to grip the arms of my armchair and cling on by\
  \ my fingertips, because I got so excited I thought I might topple out of it and\
  \ fall on the floor. And because \_I was holding on so tight to the armchair I could\
  \ not at the same time hold the book, so I had to have a sort of makeshift lectern\
  \ erected in front of me, to rest the book upon, and I had to employ an unpaid intern\
  \ from a nearby orphanage to turn the pages for me. And turn the pages they did,\
  \ for this book is a real page turner! If I have one criticism, it is that Pebblehead\
  \ does not tell us anything whatsoever about the state of hens and hen coops in\
  \ the immediate pre-Soviet era, so we cannot place the state and circumstances and\
  \ milieu of the Communist hen in any context.\nI should interrupt the critique here\
  \ to let slip some inside knowledge. I have it on good authority that Pebblehead\
  \ is currently hard at work, in his so-called chalet o\u2019 prose, on a prequel\
  \ tentatively entitled Tsarist Hen Coops. Clearly, he did not wish to duplicate\
  \ his material.\nOne chapter I found particularly thrilling was that which deals,\
  \ in spellbinding detail, with the sudden and complete transformation of Cheka hen\
  \ coops into OGPU hen coops on the sixth of February 1922. The footnote which lists\
  \ other notable events to happen on the sixth of February, including, in 1958, the\
  \ Munich Air Disaster, is the best footnote I have ever read. It is true I have\
  \ only read half a dozen footnotes in toto, the ones in this book, but of those\
  \ six this one is by far the best.\nAnother passage which had me gulping for air\
  \ and requiring urgent medical attention was the part about the creation of Potemkin\
  \ hen coops designed to pull the wool over the eyes of useful poultry idiots, the\
  \ hen equivalents of Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Reports went back to West European\
  \ and American hens about the idyllic lives of their Soviet sisters, leading to\
  \ unrest and kerfuffle in a number of farmyards. I would have liked to learn more\
  \ about Soviet eggs, but\nI am going to interrupt here again, to point out that\
  \ Pebblehead's next scheduled blockbuster, when he has finished writing Tsarist\
  \ Hen Coops, will almost certainly be a fat doorstopper entitled Eggs In The Soviet\
  \ Union.\nActually, I think we have had quite enough of that readers\u2019 report.\
  \ I think it is clear from her enthusiasm that yet again Pebblehead has pulled out\
  \ all the stops and produced a rollicking rollercoaster of a narrative. I just wish\
  \ I knew how he does it. Day in, day out, he sits there in his Alpine fastness,\
  \ pipe clenched between his jaws, pounding the keys of that battered Fabiocapello\
  \ typewriter, which long ago, in 1977, lost its J and K keys and as a result forced\
  \ on him a complete rethink of his prose style.\nPlease note that Soviet Hen Coops\
  \ is entirely devoted to hen coops in the Soviet Union, and nowhere concerns itself\
  \ with the card game Soviet Hen Coop. My spies tell me that Pebblehead will turn\
  \ his attention to this exciting pastime once he has bashed out Tsarist Hen Coops\
  \ and Eggs In The Soviet Union and one or two other books he has in the pipeline.\
  \ It will certainly be a title to look forward to, not least because Pebblehead\
  \ himself has been called the king of Soviet Hen Coop players, regularly winning\
  \ tournaments and having his name engraved over and over and over again on several\
  \ golden and pewter trophies which he keeps lined up on the mantelpiece in his chalet\
  \ o\u2019 prose, and dusts with a rag on the rare occasions he can tear himself\
  \ away from his typewriter.\n[2012-03-16]"
