  \ and when I start reading the biography I have borrowed from the library I shall\
  \ regale you with interesting snippets. For now, let us consider the title he gave\
  \ to a pen-portrait of his mother:\n\u201CMother's Wilfulness, Recklessness, Fearlessness,\
  \ Bossiness, Violence If Opposed, Tendency To Burn Food When Cooking, Vehemence\u201D\
