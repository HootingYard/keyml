text: "Precisely eleven years ago today, on 24 January 2004, the Daily Mail reported\
  \ that the Queen was due to have a knee operation, and that David Blunkett was accused\
  \ of encouraging young persons to take drugs. Meanwhile, here at Hooting Yard, I\
  \ posted a tale entitled The Phial Of Broth, or: The End Of C. W. Spraingue:\nFew\
  \ people alive today remember the highly entertaining music hall act Guesbaldo Sopwith\
  \ & His Amazing Tea Strainers. Sopwith\u2014real name Cedric William Spraingue\u2014\
  was born in the Damp Building at Hooting Yard in 18\u2013, and though his parents\
  \ dragged him off a-circusing before he could even walk, he always recalled his\
  \ birthplace with affection. At the turn of the century, when his popularity was\
  \ at its height, Sopwith returned to Hooting Yard for the first time since infancy,\
  \ to put on a Christmas Show for the bewildered and the fraught.\nThe show was of\
  \ course a tremendous success, and so thrilled were the burlap-shanked mayoral officers\
  \ of the town that they threw an impromptu banquet for Sopwith. A tent was erected\
  \ over the ice-rink, the rink itself covered in tough cork matting, and trestle-tables\
  \ were carried in piled high with such delicacies as were available in Hooting Yard\
  \ at that time.\nSopwith was ushered to a seat at the top table, and a hush descended\
  \ on the tent as the first course was brought in by the Hooting Yard Duckpond-Cleaner,\
  \ whose name was Cackbag. This geriatric half-wit carried a capacious tureen containing\
  \ gallons upon gallons of an iridescent broth, flavoured with pap, rime and bonemeal,\
  \ and reportedly thoroughly indigestible.\nCackbag slopped a ladleful of the broth\
  \ into Sopwith's rusty bowl, and the majestic entertainer was about to spoon some\
  \ of the piping hot liquid into his mouth, when of a sudden the tent was filled\
  \ with cataclasm and pandaemonium.\n\u201CCedric William Spraingue!\u201D The words\
  \ rang out, re-echoing round the canvas walls. \u201CTundists have come for you!\
  \ We will take you now!\u201D\nPoor Sopwith, ashen, trembling and incontinent, could\
  \ do little else but to obey the bidding of the unseen Tundists. As bolts of purple\
  \ light spurted around the tent, and mesmerising noises deafened the townsfolk,\
  \ he crawled to the entrance flap, a piteous figure on his hands and knees. As soon\
  \ as he was through the flap, the uproar ceased, the tent interior calmed, the air\
  \ grew still. Clamour and rack were no more: but Cedric William Spraingue, alias\
  \ Guesbaldo Sopwith, was gone. Like so many others, he had been taken by the Tundists.Who\
  \ knows why, or to what end? Like all who fell foul of Tundism, he was ne'er seen\
  \ on earth again.\nHis tea strainers, amazing though they may have been, were disposed\
  \ of through a public auction on the first anniversary of his vanishment. All his\
  \ other personal effects were sold off, burned, cast into canals, or donated to\
  \ educational institutions for tiny ones. All, that is, except for one item.\nThe\
  \ banquet was abandoned after the Tundists had fallen upon the tent. Small urchins\
  \ were plucked from the gutters to clear everything away, and were given the uneaten\
  \ food as a reward. One such urchin, who earlier that day had been held entranced\
  \ by the Amazing Tea Strainers act, was so upset by the disappearance of Sopwith\
  \ that he carried the bowl of unslurped broth away with him under his sordid tunic,\
  \ as a trophy.\nHe kept it at home in his infected hut until it began to moulder\
  \ and stink out even this most noisome of hovels, whereupon he took it to an apothecary\
  \ who very carefully encased what was left of the broth in a glass phial, the very\
  \ phial which is today found underneath the water-pipes in the janitor's cupboard\
  \ next to the boiler room in the basement of the Museum at Hooting Yard, where it\
  \ can be viewed by appointment only.\n[2015-01-24]"
