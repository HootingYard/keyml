text: "I recently came across a fascinating personality test. Normally, I give short\
  \ shrift to such things, because they tend to be devised by airheads drunk on a\
  \ combination of psychobabble and inanity, but this one delighted me. Unfortunately\
  \ I can't reproduce it here. Rarely have I seen a document so thoroughly protected\
  \ by copyright, threatening extreme measures up to and including the crushing of\
  \ one's skull and the sale into slavery of one's descendants, yea unto the fourth\
  \ generation. Very occasionally I have shown a devil-may-care attitude in the face\
  \ of such warnings, but I am not an idiot.\nAnyway, as far as I can see, there is\
  \ nothing to stop me paraphrasing a few questions from the test, so that's what\
  \ I'll do. It's called \u201CAre You A Bird Or A Cow?\u201D. I looked in vain for\
  \ any indication that these are meant as types of human personality, so I can only\
  \ assume that we are meant to take it literally. Maybe the test is meant to be conducted\
  \ on behalf of your bird or cow acquaintances who are confused about their identity.\
  \ That would make perfect sense.\nSo, for example, there are questions like Would\
  \ you say you were flighty or given to rumination? and Do you prefer standing in\
  \ a field or perching high in a tree? Please remember that I am only paraphrasing.\
  \ One question asks specifically whether for breakfast you would prefer to eat millet\
  \ or cud. Oddly, it doesn't go on to ask about elevenses, lunch, dinner, tea, or\
  \ supper, and nor is there any mention of snacks. This may indicate a certain laxness\
  \ in the methodology employed, par for the course with tests such as this, but given\
  \ the ferocious look on the face of the deviser, whose photograph appears at the\
  \ top of the first page, I am minded not to level any criticism.\nI completed the\
  \ test for myself, rather than as a proxy for my crow Martin or for a cow I know\
  \ called Degustibus, and the results were extremely interesting.\n[2008-01-25]"
