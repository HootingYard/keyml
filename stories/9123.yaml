text: "One day long long ago, in the bloom of youth, I was at the seaside, tarrying\
  \ on a pier, fresh from a game of crazy golf and sucking an ice lolly. The sky was\
  \ overcast and seabirds were screeching. I had decided, when once I was done with\
  \ my lolly, to return to the dilapidated boarding house where I was staying with\
  \ my parents and siblings, to fetch my swimming trunks and a towel, and then to\
  \ go a-splashing in the sea. But as I leaned against the railings on the pier, sucking\
  \ away, I was accosted by an elderly gent. He gave off a stink of kippers and brine\
  \ and his huge hairy beard was riddled with fishbones. He leaned against the railings\
  \ next to me, and pointed out to sea.\n\u201CLook, sonny,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  What do you see?\u201D\nI looked in the direction of his pointing finger and could\
  \ just make out, in the sea-mist, the shape of a ship, half way to the horizon.\n\
  \u201CI see a ship,\u201D I said.\n\u201CAye, 'tis a ship indeed,\u201D said the\
  \ old sea dog, \u201CAnd can you tell me the basic constituent parts of, say, a\
  \ wooden ship?\u201D\n\u201CI'll try my best,\u201D I said, for I was biddable and\
  \ eager to please, \u201CSternpost, keel, false keel or shoe, fore foot or gripe,\
  \ stem, headpiece, garboard strake, bottom planking, side planking, wale, sheer\
  \ strake, covering board, bulwark, rough-tree rail, topgallant bulwark, rudder,\
  \ counter, stern, chain plates, cathead, figurehead, mizzenmast, mainmast, foremast,\
  \ and\u2026 oh\u2026 there's one part on the tip of my tongue.\u201D\nThe old tar\
  \ stuffed a gobbet of salt taffy into his mouth and chewed on it, looking at me\
  \ with a twinkle in his eye.\n\u201CBowsprit!\u201D, I cried, triumphantly.\n\u201C\
  Good lad,\u201D he said, \u201CBut what if I asked you to name three different types\
  \ of parrel and their constituent parts?\u201D\n\u201CGolly!\u201D, I said, and\
  \ after a moment's thought, babbling, I listed what I could recall. \u201CWell,\
  \ first, a parrel with cleats on a wooden yard, you'd have topmast, yard, wooden\
  \ cleats, a half-iron hoop served with leather, pins forming hinges to open the\
  \ parrel, an iron band to take the tie, and iron straps and bolts securing the parrel\
  \ to the yard. But if you had a tub parrel for an iron yard, then there would be\
  \ topmast, yard, tub divided in halves, iron binding for same, gooseneck bolt, iron\
  \ bands to take parrel and tie, yoke for the parrel, yoke for the tie, and eye bolt\
  \ for the quarterblock. Thereagain, with a parrel sliding on a T-bar in a big ship,\
  \ I would say topmast, topsail yard, T-bar, slide, two-way coupling, tie, connecting\
  \ chain keeping slide in place, and last but by no means least, eye bolts for quarterblocks,\
  \ captain. Should I call you captain?\u201D\n\u201CIt is many a long year since\
  \ I served as a captain, my boy,\u201D he said, \u201CBut tell me, if you cobbled\
  \ together a topsail yard, parrel, rolling spar, iron drum end of the rolling spar,\
  \ yardarm hoop, arm carrying the reefing halliard block, cheek block for topgallant\
  \ sheet, parrel crutch with lignum vitae rollers, lignum vitae rollers, topsail,\
  \ lead block for reefing halliards, and topsail yardarm, what would you have?\u201D\
  \nI rubbed my chin to demonstrate that I was thinking carefully, as Darbyshire does,\
  \ in imitation of Mr Carter, in the books by Anthony Buckeridge.\n\u201CI think,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CNo, I know\u2026 you'd have Colling's and Pinkney's patent self-reefing\
  \ topsail, would you not?\u201D\n\u201CYou would indeed,\u201D said the ancient\
  \ mariner, and he spat his salt taffy into the sea.\nI waited for his next question.\n\
  \u201CI wonder if you can tell me,\u201D he said, \u201CAbout a four-masted barque.\u201D\
  \n\u201CEasy peasy,\u201D I said, but too quickly, because with a glint of impatience,\
  \ he snapped:\n\u201CNot just any four-masted barque, lad, but a particular one!\
  \ Tell me everything you know about the Herzogin Cecilie!\u201D\nI gulped, and took\
  \ a last suck on what was left of my ice lolly.\n\u201CWell,\u201D I began, haltingly,\
  \ \u201CThe Herzogin Cecilie, the Herzogin Cecilie\u2026 Ah, I think that was a\
  \ four-masted barque built in 1902 by Rickmers shipyard at Bremerhaven for the Norddeutscher\
  \ Lloyd at Bremen. It was a big sailing vessel of three thousand, two hundred and\
  \ forty-two gross tons or four thousand, three hundred and fifty dw. She was a good\
  \ sailer and made many excellent voyages. During World War One she was interned\
  \ at Coquimbo in Chile. After the war, she brought a cargo of bauxite to Ostend,\
  \ and\u2026 no, not bauxite, it was a cargo of nitrate. At Ostend she was allocated\
  \ to the French government. In November 1921 she was purchased by Gustaf Erikson,\
  \ Mariehamn, Finland, and under his flag was employed chiefly in the Australian\
  \ grain trade. She foundered on 25 April 1936 off Salcombe in Devonshire, after\
  \ running aground in heavy fog.\u201D\n\u201CTiptop Herzogin Cecilie information,\u201D\
  \ said the sea dog, beaming at me, \u201CNow, just one more question. How many jibs\
  \ did she have?\u201D\n\u201CI would say three,\u201D I replied, \u201CAn inner\
  \ jib, an outer jib, and a flying jib.\u201D\n\u201CAnd you would be right to say\
  \ so,\u201D he said, \u201CBut now our conversation is at an end.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Oh,\u201D I said, a little downcast, \u201CI think that must be the first time I\
  \ have had a ship-related conversation with no mention at all of poop or orlop decks.\u201D\
  \n\u201CDon't you worry,\u201D he said, \u201CYou will be having plenty more ship-related\
  \ conversations in the decades to come, for you have passed my rigorous tests and\
  \ I am going to press-gang you into the service of the king's navy.\u201D\nAnd so\
  \ saying, he suddenly gave me a great shove and pushed me over the railings and\
  \ I splashed into the sea. I was picked up by a rowing boat sent from the wooden\
  \ ship he had pointed out to me, in the distance, now wholly enshrouded in sea-mist.\
  \ And into that mist I was rowed, by a crew of hefty silent rowers, until the ship\
  \ loomed huge ahead, and looking back I could no longer see any trace of the the\
  \ pier, and the shore, and the dilapidated boarding house where my parents and siblings\
  \ waited for me.\n[2012-05-10]"
