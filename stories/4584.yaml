text: "1. A very poor child, of the parish of Newington-Butts\u2026 was a very monster\
  \ of wickedness, and a thousand times more miserable and vile by his sin than by\
  \ his poverty. He was running to hell as fast as he could go, and was old in vice\
  \ when he was but young in years: we scarcely hear of one so like the devil in his\
  \ infancy as was this poor child. What sin was there that his age was capable of,\
  \ which he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature, and the abominable\
  \ example of little beggar boys, he was indeed arrived at a great pitch of impiety.\
  \ He would call names, take God's name in vain, curse, swear, and do all kinds of\
  \ mischief; and as to any thing of God, he was worse than a heathen\u2026\n6. He\
  \ was in grievous agonies of spirit; his former sins stared him in the face, and\
  \ made him tremble. The poison of God's arrows did even drink up his spirits; the\
  \ sense of sin and of wrath were so great that he knew not what to do. The weight\
  \ of God's displeasure, and the thought of lying under it to all eternity, broke\
  \ him even to pieces, and he bitterly cried out, \u201CWhat shall I do! I am a miserable\
  \ sinner, and I fear that I shall go to hell.\u201D His sins had been so great and\
  \ so many, that there was no hope for him\u2026\n14. The Wednesday before he died,\
  \ he lay in a trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he saw a vision\
  \ of angels\u2026\n16 \u2026he gave a kind of leap in his bed, and snapped his finger\
  \ and thumb together with abundance of joy. And from that time forward, in full\
  \ joy and assurance of God's love, he continued earnestly praising God, desiring\
  \ to die, and to be with Christ.\nJohn Wesley, Stories Of Boys And Girls Who Loved\
  \ The Saviour (date uncertain)\n[2010-06-05]"
