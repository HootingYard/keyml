  \ Clark has files, a project\u2014and a minefield. The Petula Clark minefield was\
  \ the happy outcome of my determination, with the Petula Clark project, to put to\
  \ good use the materials in the Petula Clark files, which I had collected in the\
  \ 1960s and kept, for fifty years, in a remote secure storage facility guarded by\
  \ wolves.\nThe idea came to me when, one windswept morning, I was sashaying along\
  \ a majestic and important boulevard in my bailiwick. All of a sudden, my boon companion\
  \ Walter Mad, the animal behaviourist, amateur electrician, and van owner, drove\
  \ up alongside me in his van, slowed to sashaying pace, wound down his window, and\
  \ shouted at me.\n\u201CI have inherited a field!\u201D he cried.\nLater, over tea\
  \ and toffee, I learned more. An elderly Mad uncle had died and left to his nephew,\
  \ in his last will and testament, a field, somewhere out in the blasted and awful\
  \ countryside.\n\u201CIf it were a magnetic field,\u201D moaned Walter Mad, \u201C\
  I might be interested. But it is nothing more than a flat expanse of mud and muck\
  \ out beyond the Blister Lane Bypass, past the viaduct and the ha-ha and the decoy\
  \ duckpond and the foopball pitch and the giant cement statue of Nobby Stiles and\
  \ the weird cloud of ectoplasm and the bridge over the river Horrible and the vinegar\
  \ works and Pang Hill Orphanage and the clown hospital and the blasted heath and\
  \ the Bolshevik ballet school and the forest of gargoyles and the sump of slurry\
  \ and the remote secure storage facility and the -\u201D\n\u201CWait!\u201D I cried,\
  \ \u201CThis field of yours is near the storage facility?\u201D\n\u201CHad you allowed\
  \ me to finish I would have listed several more significant landmarks on the way\
  \ but, yes, it is fairly close by, as the crow flies.\u201D\n\u201CI have an idea!\u201D\
  \ I cried, and I jumped into the van and told Walter Mad to drive like the clappers.\n\
  My idea was the Petula Clark minefield. Through Walter Mad's inheritance, we had\
  \ the field. The next step was to remove the Petula Clark files from the remote\
  \ secure storage facility, and then to remove each of the six or seven press clippings\
  \ from its buff cardboard folder. The folders we tossed, unsentimentally, on to\
  \ a nearby bonfire. It was then a simple matter to have each of the six or seven\
  \ press clippings laminated, to protect them against the many and various calamities\
  \ of awful countryside weather. Once laminated, each press clipping was attached\
  \ to one end of a pointy stick\u2014that is, to the non-pointy end.\nAt this stage\
  \ I had not decided whether the Petula Clark minefield would accommodate one customer\
  \ at a time, armed with all six or seven pointy sticks to which were attached the\
  \ laminated Petula Clark press clippings, or six or seven customers simultaneously,\
  \ each armed with a single pointy stick. Six or seven customers at a time was probably\
  \ the better option, as it would allow us to advertise the Petula Clark minefield\
  \ as a splendid opportunity for awayday team-building exercises for middle managers\
  \ in small to medium size companies.\nImagine the fun, as the six or seven customers\
  \ are handed a pointy stick each, to one end of which is affixed by twine a laminated\
  \ press clipping about Petula Clark. They must now make their way across the flat\
  \ expanse of mud and muck, prodding the ground at intervals in an attempt to locate\
  \ the mines submerged just below the surface. If they successfully locate each of\
  \ the six or seven mines with their pointy sticks, they win. But if they inadvertently\
  \ tread upon a mine, they lose.\nThe mines themselves are not explosive. Instead,\
  \ using a clever bit of electrical gubbins concocted by Walter Mad using his amateur\
  \ electrician skills, when a mine is \u201Cdetonated\u201D it blasts forth, at deafening\
  \ volume, a recording of Petula Clark singing her tiptop hit, written by Tony Hatch\
  \ and first released in 1964, shortly before I began to compile the Petula Clark\
  \ files, \u201CDowntown\u201D.\nWhat an exciting day that was, when Walter Mad and\
  \ I first opened the Petula Clark minefield to paying customers! I felt a warm glow\
  \ of content that I had at long last put the Petula Clark files to good use by devising\
  \ the Petula Clark project and, with the Petula Clark minefield, bringing it to\
  \ fruition. The lesson, I think, is that even when one of your activities seems\
  \ utterly pointless\u2014and believe me, there were times over the past half century\
  \ when I wondered why on earth I clung on to those six or seven Petula Clark press\
  \ clippings and kept them in a remote secure storage facility guarded by wolves\u2014\
  there is always the chance that you can take the pointless and make it pointy. That\
  \ is what I did, and you can too, especially if your boon companion inherits from\
  \ a Mad uncle a flat expanse of mud and muck.\n[2015-10-24]"
