text: 'Hark! Hark! The dogs do bark

  Upon the deck of Noah''s ark.

  Noah decides to muzzle them

  Helped by Japheth, Ham, and Shem.

  Thus the dogs are rendered mute

  So we can hear the dulcet flute

  Played by a chap standing on one leg.

  Not Herman Melville''s tar Queequeg,

  This fellow goes by the name of Ian,

  A name emblazoned once in neon

  At vast arenas throughout the land

  For he was the leader of a band

  A hairy band called Jethro Tull

  Now he''s beshat on by a gull

  Upon the deck of Noah''s ark.

  The bird flies on into the dark.

  The flautist wipes his old tramp''s coat,

  Cursing the day he boarded this boat.

  But it rained and rained and rained and rained

  And rained and rained and rained and rained.

  The ark was a lifeline to which he clung,

  And he''d long ago lost his aqualung.
