text: 'Yesterday''s episode of Hooting Yard On The Air (aka A General Air Of Decrepitude)
  was a packed show. Mr Key read the stories A Dream, At Night, and An Old Manuscript,
  and he was joined for a performance of the one-act play Overheard In A Supermarket
  by Miss Blossom Partridge, aka Pansy Cradledew, who also read The Coronation and
  joined Mr Key for a recital of In Gath. In addition, there was a brief discussion
  of Scritti Politti, an old French saying, and new verse by Dennis Beerpint.
