text: "Rain clouds will sweep in from the west before lunchtime. Thunder will brew.\
  \ Across parks and woodland, stunned unconscious squirrels will lie scattered upon\
  \ the ground. In taller buildings, electrical wiring systems will fizz and pop.\
  \ Tarnished silver will glisten anew. The Pontiff will appear on his balcony. Watch\
  \ the way he moves his arms.\nSolveg rides tall in the saddle. He has had a shampoo\
  \ and rinse and even applied subtle dyes to his hair. He has perfected the art of\
  \ making an omelette without breaking any eggs. Solveg has lost his good old mama,\
  \ and must have whisky. Oh, you know why. He, too, moves his arms in that distinctively\
  \ Papist manner.\nIn a coppice, one of the squirrels regains consciousness. It skitters\
  \ up a tree, a larch or a laburnum. What a coppice! From far off there is a rumble\
  \ of thunder. Looking west, the squirrel from its high vantage point sees Solveg's\
  \ good old mama approaching across the fields. Her arms are hidden in the folds\
  \ of an old red shawl.\nTungsten manufacture continues apace in the Buna. The plant\
  \ is too noisy for the sudden sheets of pelting rain to be heard hitting the roof.\
  \ Magnus is in his cubicle checking some paperwork. There is garlic on his breath\
  \ and garlic too, a whole clove, encased in the ceramic pod slung around his neck\
  \ on a lanyard. Behind him on the wall hangs a crucifix. The pinned Christ thereon\
  \ is daubed with red to mimic gore. Magnus moves his arms restlessly.\nAt the foot\
  \ of the mountains lies a squalid village. Solveg was born here. Today it has more\
  \ goats than people. The people don't need a park, but they have got one, a municipal\
  \ park with lawns and flowerbeds and volleyball courts and a bandstand and a duckpond\
  \ and a paddling pool for children. When it was laid out by prisoners of war it\
  \ had beacon status. Now it is overrun by goats. The statue of Christ in the centre\
  \ of one of the lawns shows Him with one arm raised in benediction. The other arm\
  \ was snapped off long ago.\nIn a crevice in a rock at the bottom of the sea, a\
  \ demersal being opens one cold alien eye. It summons the rain clouds from the west.\
  \ It summons the thunder. It stuns the squirrels. It has no arms, nor flippers nor\
  \ fins nor even tendrils. It is a weird blob.\nSolveg on his horse, Magnus in the\
  \ Buna, both have a keen interest in marine biology. Neither of them put it to use.\
  \ Now, both of them move their arms towards the sea, towards where they think the\
  \ sea must be. The coppice is far, far from the sea.\nIn the park, in the drained\
  \ paddling pool, the goats run amok. You will find many, many goats in the Bible,\
  \ but no squirrels, and no demersal blobs. One such blob clung like a barnacle to\
  \ the submerged timber of the Ark. And then it came loose, and sank to the bottom\
  \ of the sea. Arms are moved towards where the sea must be, from far inland.\nAt\
  \ lunchtime, the rain clouds burst.\_\n[2009-05-01]"
