text: "\u201CNearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself before he was fifty to\
  \ be a candidate for the Travellers\u2019 Club; and sometimes the fine gentleman,\
  \ who declined taking an active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly\
  \ a thousand miles from home, with an imperial rescript in his portmanteau enjoining\
  \ him not to return to Rome without special leave.\n\u201CTo such a compulsory journey\
  \ was the poet Ovid condemned, apparently for his very particular attentions to\
  \ the Princess Julia. His exile was a piece of ingenious cruelty. He was sent to\
  \ Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all fashionable bathing-places. The climate\
  \ was atrocious; the neighbourhood was worse; the wine was execrable and was often\
  \ hard frozen, and eaten like a lozenge, and his only society was that of the barracks,\
  \ or a few rich but unpolished corn-factors, who speculated in grain and deals on\
  \ the shores of the Euxine. To write verses from morn to dewy eve was the unfortunate\
  \ poet's only solace; and he sent so many reams of elegies to Rome, that his friends\
  \ came at last to vote him a bore, and he was reduced, for want of fitting audience,\
  \ to learn the Getic language, and read his lacrymose couplets to circles of gaping\
  \ barbarians.\u201D\nWilliam Bodham Donne, Old Roads And New Roads (1852)\n[2010-07-13]"
