  IAN ANDERSON, minstrel & father of Gael\nScene: A mansion in the countryside\nEnter\
  \ GAEL and ANDREW\nGAEL\_: Oh darling! I am so thrilled at the prospect of our imminent\
  \ betrothal!\nANDREW\_: As I am too, my poppet. [A dark cloud passes over his brow.]\
  \ But first I must ask your father for your hand in marriage. I fear he may place\
  \ hurdles in our path.\nGAEL\_: It is true he can be an exacting man, darling, but\
  \ I feel sure you will win him over.\nANDREW\_: Well, we shall find out soon enough.\
  \ Hark! I hear him approach!\nEnter IAN ANDERSON\nIAN\_: Hello Gael, hello young\
  \ fellow-me-lad.\nGAEL\_: Hello Papa!\nANDREW\_: Hello Ian \u2026 I may call you\
  \ Ian?\nIAN\_: No you may not. Address me as J-Tull Dot Com, as in the title of\
  \ the 1999 album release by my rock band.\nANDREW\_: Oh \u2026 okay.\nIAN\_: [Laughing]\
  \ But I jest with you! By all means call me Ian. And what brings you to my country\
  \ pile on this lovely summer's day, sonny?\nANDREW\_: Well, I, er, um \u2026\nGAEL\_\

  \ of your daughter in marriage.\nIAN\_: I see. And are you a worthy suitor?\nGAEL\_\
  : He is, Papa, he is!\nIAN\_: To be worthy of my daughter, a man must be able to\
  \ play the flute while standing on one leg. Can you do that, son?\nANDREW\_: [Crestfallen]\
  \ I'm not sure.\nGAEL\_: But Papa, Andrew has other special skills. He has fought\
  \ many zombies, and has a string of triumphs over the walking dead!\nIAN\_: Really?\
  \ I have not heard anything so preposterous since Crest Of A Knave, the 1987 album\
  \ release by my rock band.\nGAEL\_: Yes, really, Papa! Have you not seen the post-apocalyptic\
  \ television drama The Walking Dead? Every week, Andrew gives those zombies the\
  \ what-for!\nIAN\_: My poor sweet child, you are confusing Mr Clutterbuck here with\
  \ Andrew Lincoln, the zombie-battling star of that show.\nANDREW\_: Be it known\
  \ that I am Andrew Lincoln! Born a Clutterbuck, I dropped that foolish surname when\
  \ I embarked upon my glittering thespian career.\nIAN\_: Is that so? Well then,\
  \ I give my consent!\nGAEL\_: Oh thank you Papa!\nANDREW\_: Thank you, J-Tull Dot\
  \ Com sir!\nIAN\_: Let us celebrate by singing a few snatches from Aqualung, the\
  \ 1971 album release by my rock band.\nThey sing & wassail.\nCurtain.\n\n[2018-03-19]"
