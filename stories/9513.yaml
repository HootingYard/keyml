text: "The ventriloquist Claud Plon was out for a spin in his jalopy when he had a\
  \ prang. He hit a lamppost, the collision with which rent and twisted the bonnet\
  \ of the jalopy, exposing part of the engine, which belched forth jets of steam.\n\
  \u201COops!\u201D said his dummy, a puppet called Bonko. Bonko was a sock stuffed\
  \ with kapok who had a couple of glass beads sewn on to serve as eyes.\n\u201CSorry\
  \ about that, Bonko, I wasn't looking where I was going,\u201D said the ventriloquist,\
  \ \u201CAre you all right?\u201D\n\u201CI think I have suffered a whiplash injury,\u201D\
  \ replied Bonko, who may have been lying, as to the untrained eye he looked perfectly\
  \ okay.\n\u201CGoodness gracious!\u201D said Claud Plon, \u201CWe shall have to\
  \ get you to the doll hospital.\u201D\n\u201CWhy on earth would we go to a doll\
  \ hospital?\u201D asked Bonko, \u201CI am not a doll. I am a sock stuffed with kapok\
  \ with a couple of glass beads sewn on to serve as eyes.\u201D\n\u201CYes, I see\
  \ your point,\u201D said Plon, \u201CThen what about a puppet clinic?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Is there such a place as a puppet clinic?\u201D asked Bonko.\n\u201CI have heard\
  \ tell there is one in Pointy Town,\u201D said the ventriloquist.\n\u201CBut we\
  \ are miles and miles away,\u201D said Bonko, \u201CAnd I fear my whiplash may be\
  \ fatal, for I can already feel myself succumbing to faintness and a lack of oxygen\
  \ to the brain, pins and needles, darting pains behind my glass beads, and the gradual\
  \ oozing of the very life out of me.\u201D\nThis time Bonko was definitely lying,\
  \ or at least embroidering the truth. But Claud Plon was both devoted and gullible.\
  \ It would never occur to him that Bonko might be trying to pull the wool over his\
  \ eyes, which in the ventriloquist's case were real, working eyes, not mere sewn-on\
  \ glass beads. There had been occasions in the past when people suggested that Bonko\
  \ might be a mendacious fantasist, and Plon had been so inflamed with outrage that\
  \ he had beaten the accusers about the head with a shovel. Bonko egged him on, urging\
  \ him to bash and bash and bash until the bashee was dead.\nPlon was now in something\
  \ of a panic. Bonko, who was a fine judge of distance, was absolutely correct that\
  \ they were very far away from Pointy Town and its puppet clinic. Also, the prang\
  \ had been severe enough to render the jalopy motionless. Crank it as frantically\
  \ as he could, it was not going anywhere. Steam continued to hiss from the bonnet.\n\
  \u201CWhat are we going to do?\u201D wailed Plon.\n\u201CYou had better think of\
  \ something quickly, because I am fading fast,\u201D said Bonko, \u201CIt is as\
  \ if I am in a long, dark tunnel, and there is an unearthly light towards which\
  \ I feel impelled to go.\u201D\n\u201CDon't go into the light!\u201D screamed Plon,\
  \ remembering certain supernatural thriller films he had seen.\n\u201CBut it is\
  \ such an attractive light,\u201D said Bonko, \u201CI feel drawn to it.\u201D\n\
  Claud Plon could think of nothing but to repeat his shrieked words. At which point\
  \ the jalopy burst into flames. The ventriloquist and his dummy would surely have\
  \ been engulfed and burned to a crisp had not a big red fire engine screeched to\
  \ a halt beside them, bells clanging, and the fire been doused by untold gallons\
  \ of water spurting from a hose trained upon the jalopy by three heroic firemen.\
  \ Seconds later, there was further clanging, and an ambulance pulled up, out of\
  \ which poured three heroic paramedics. They grabbed the ventriloquist and shoved\
  \ him with skilled gentleness onto a stretcher.\n\u201CNever mind about me,\u201D\
  \ he cried, \u201CSave Bonko!\u201D\nBut as he cried out a needle was injected into\
  \ his arm and a fast-acting narcotic coursed through his veins and he lost consciousness.\n\
  \nClaud Plon awoke next day, flat on his back in a bed in a ward of the Hattie Jacques\
  \ Memorial Hospital. His brain was dizzy, he bore a few singe-marks here and there,\
  \ but was otherwise as fit as a fiddle. He looked wildly around, but there was no\
  \ sign of Bonko. He pressed a buzzer at his bedside, summoning an angel of mercy.\
  \ Plon raved; was not understood; and was drugged back into unconsciousness.\n\n\
  There is, high on a hill in a rustic backwater some miles from Pointy Town, a big\
  \ grim crenellated smoke-blackened mansion, once the home of robber barons but now\
  \ a home for the bewildered and befuddled and frankly bonkers. Claud Plon, the ventriloquist\
  \ and one-time star of the variety theatre, has lived here for twenty years, having\
  \ been delivered on a stretcher, manacled, at dead of night. In his room in one\
  \ of the towers, he raves and mutters. He goes barefoot, for the staff have a standing\
  \ instruction never to allow him anywhere near socks. His simple tunic and trousers\
  \ are fastened with zips, for it is thought best not to give him buttons, so easily\
  \ mistaken for beads of glass. He has no visitors.\n\nThere is, at the foot of a\
  \ hill in a rustic backwater some miles from Pointy Town, a rubbish dump. Over the\
  \ years it has grown as it is piled ever higher with waste, things discarded, things\
  \ bent and broken, things forgotten and abandoned, big and small, from lollipop\
  \ sticks to wrecked jalopies. Within this midden, open to the elements, frayed around\
  \ the edges and still bearing the singe-marks from a fire twenty years ago, there\
  \ is a sock. It was once stuffed with kapok, much of which has fallen out. It once\
  \ had two glass beads sewn on, where now there is only one. Sometimes urchins and\
  \ wastrels and beggars will come trudging through the waste in search of scraps\
  \ and scantlings. It is said that, when the air is still and the gulls cease shrieking,\
  \ a voice can be heard, from somewhere in the dump, a peevish, rancorous, cursing\
  \ voice, spitting with vituperation.\n\u201CLet me into the fucking light!\u201D\
  \ it cries.\n[2012-06-23]"
