text: "\nI have never watched a single episode of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, so\
  \ I had no idea who Cockney matriarch Lou Beale was. I do, however, read obituaries\
  \ with great interest, including those of people of whom I have never heard. And\
  \ when reading the Guardian obituary of Anna Wing, the actress who played Lou Beale,\
  \ I learned that \u201Cbetween 1953 and 1960, she was the partner of the surrealist\
  \ poet Philip O'Connor\u201D and \u201Cshe encouraged [him] to write his first book,\
  \ the extraordinary Memoirs of a Public Baby (1958)\u201D.\nI had never heard of\
  \ O'Connor either, and my interest was piqued\u2014rightly so, I realised, when\
  \ I read his 1998 obituary in The Independent. Here I learned, among other things,\
  \ that his mother abandoned him twice during his childhood, and the second time\n\
  he was again adopted, this time by a one-legged bachelor civil servant who wore\
  \ size 13 boots and owned a small wooden hut on Box Hill near Dorking\nand that\n\
  The impression that he created as a young man in wartime Fitzrovia was of utter\
  \ precariousness. As thin as a skeleton, his face already eroded, his smile never\
  \ calm, he lived off doughnuts and Woodbines, ogled at women and spoke in cryptograms,\
  \ spoonerisms and jingles, delivering sentences backwards and falling about in drunken\
  \ exhilaration\nand\nMany people knew him simply as The Man Who Stood Behind The\
  \ Door And Said \u201CBoo!\u201D To T.S. Eliot\nWho could read those snippets and\
  \ not want to read the Memoirs? So I borrowed a copy from the library, and am already\
  \ delighted, by page 35, to learn that Philip O'Connor had \u201Ca lasting fear\
  \ of monkeys . . . feeling horribly near to them and that I have a secret they might\
  \ discover which would involve me in some unconscious activity consequent upon the\
  \ discovery of a bond between us.\u201D\nSelf-consciously \u201Cbohemian\u201D drunkard\
  \ poets are tiresome, particularly when convinced of their own genius, and no doubt\
  \ in person O'Connor was\u2014as Stephen Spender says in his introduction to the\
  \ Memoirs\u2014\u201Ca menace\u201D. But they can also, sometimes, write wonderful\
  \ books, and Memoirs Of A Public Baby\u2014what I have read of it so far\u2014is\
  \ one. Bear in mind, too, that the Independent obituary notes that O'Connor \u201C\
  dabbled interestingly with chickens\u201D.\n[2013-07-21]"
