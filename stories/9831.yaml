text: "Marking the death of Robert Hughes yesterday, there were dozens of quotations\
  \ I could have used, and I chose the one about the Inner Child and the Inner Adult\
  \ more or less at random. It is a fine example of what Michael McNay in his Grauniad\
  \ obituary calls Hughes\u2019 talent for \u201C[an] epigrammatic judgment that condenses\
  \ deep truths\u201D. It was a fortuitous choice, for it prompted Outa_Spaceman to\
  \ bring to my attention another Inner Being of which I was previously unaware, the\
  \ Inner Chimp.\nThe Inner Chimp seems to reside mainly within Outer Cyclists\u2014\
  or, as I tend to call them as they hurtle towards me on the London pavements, bike\
  \ wankers. Outa_Spaceman supplied this intriguing extract from a 2009 Grauniad article:\n\
  In his absorbing and often riveting new book, [Mark] Cavendish trashes the contribution\
  \ of some former leading members of British cycling\u2014in particular, Simon Jones,\
  \ acclaimed as the UK's coach of the year after the 2004 Olympics. \u201CHe was\
  \ a dickhead and all their scientific analysis of riders is complete bollocks when\
  \ it comes to me. They kept telling me I wasn't hitting the numbers but look what's\
  \ happened since. I couldn't give a fuck about Simon Jones.\u201D\nWith more warmth,\
  \ he describes [Dave] Brailsford, the feted performance director of British cycling,\
  \ as \u201Ca media darling\u201D. He is also amused at the way in which Britain's\
  \ Olympic gold-medal winning track cyclists are so heavily reliant on the sports\
  \ psychologist Steve Peters\u2014who has done so much to ease the often tortured\
  \ psyches of Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton, and even Chris Hoy. \u201CI like Steve.\
  \ But all that stuff about \u2018taming your inner chimp [of negative thought]\u2019\
  \ is hilarious.\u201D\nI looked up Dave Brailsford on the Wikipedia and learned\
  \ that he is the son of an Alpine mountain guide. This is no doubt extremely pertinent\
  \ to his discovery of the Inner Chimp, though in ways I have not yet been able to\
  \ pinpoint. Chimps do not, after all, hang about in the snow white Alps. Yet I sense\
  \ a tantalising connection there, between the tiny Brailsford plodding in his Papa's\
  \ footsteps o'er the the Alps and his adult conviction that cyclists are prey to\
  \ their Inner Chimp. When I have worked out the cast iron link between the two,\
  \ I will let you know.\nMeanwhile, forgetting all about the Alps for the time being,\
  \ it is worth considering the Inner Chimp in and of itself. I would like to know\
  \ if it lurks within all of us, whether or not we are bike wankers. I myself am\
  \ a militant pedestrian, though I share Rayner Heppenstall's puzzlement at the need\
  \ for a separate word to designate those of us who use the basic form of human locomotion.\
  \ But I am now wondering if, whenever I walk from A to B, or from Haemoglobin Towers\
  \ to Nameless Pond, I have an Inner Chimp struggling to assert itself. I would be\
  \ interested to discover how it would make itself known.\nThere is a clue, perhaps,\
  \ in the reference to the \u201Coften tortured psyches\u201D of Bradley Wiggins\
  \ and Victoria Pendleton. From my scant viewing of the Olympics hoo-hah, I would\
  \ say that the latter does look rather highly strung, in a mad-woman-in-the-attic\
  \ way, but Wiggins seems a far more relaxed character. But if Brailsford is to be\
  \ believed, both of them have an Inner Chimp, which explains their tortured psyches.\
  \ I am fairly sure my own psyche would be tortured if, as soon as I set out on foot\
  \ somewhere, my Inner Chimp started jabbering for attention and threatened to become\
  \ an Outer Chimp. I would run for the hills, if not the Alps. Though perhaps that\
  \ is what the Inner Chimp would want me to do. This is devilishly complicated stuff.\n\
  It also leads me to wonder if chimpanzees themselves have an inner bike wanker.\
  \ Next time I go the zoological gardens I am going to study the chimps very very\
  \ carefully for telltale signs. What those signs might be I do not yet know, but\
  \ I suspect I will find out if, for example, I flash a red light at the chimps and\
  \ they are thereby compelled to rush towards it at inhuman speed, scattering adults\
  \ and children and guide dogs and puppies and indeed any innocent life-form that\
  \ gets in their way.\nThe other animal we have mentioned with an Olympic connection\
  \ is the otter. What, I wonder, does Brailsford, or indeed Cavendish or Pendleton\
  \ or Wiggins have to say on the subject of the Inner Otter? Cycling and beach volleyball\
  \ are of course two different sports, and there is no reason to think that Inner\
  \ Animals cross over from one to the other. But if the world of Inner Animals is\
  \ as rich in variety and unfathomable weirdness as the world of actual, Outer Animals,\
  \ it would not be surprising if there were instances of cyclists with Inner Otters,\
  \ otters with Inner Chimps, chimps with Inner Cyclists, and Lord knows what other\
  \ combinations.\nPersonally, I am looking forward to the day when everyone gives\
  \ free rein to their Inner Pedestrian. Actually, strike that. Given that much of\
  \ the population appears to be savage and barbaric, the ideal thing would be for\
  \ most of them to unleash their Inner Stay-Indoors-And-Read-Morally-Uplifting-And-Improving-Literature-By-Candlelight\
  \ Persons. Then I could happily walk from A to B and from Haemoglobin Towers to\
  \ Nameless Pond without having my progress blighted by either bike wankers or shambling\
  \ gits. Oh happy day!, in the unlikely event it ever dawns.\n[2012-08-08]"
