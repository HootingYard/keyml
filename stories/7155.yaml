text: "In that piece from seven years ago reposted yesterday, I quote from the Book\
  \ of Isaiah (King James Version). It is there we meet the so-called Isaiah Cormorant,\
  \ one of four cormorants to be found in the Bible, the four most culturally important\
  \ cormorants ever to have existed. Anybody who is serious about cormorants, and\
  \ about culturally important cormorants in particular, ought to be familiar with\
  \ them. It may well be true, as Charles Bradlaugh (1833\u20131891) observed, that\
  \ the books of the Bible had their origins in the ravings of \u201Cilliterate half-starved\
  \ visionaries in some dark corner of a Graeco-Syrian slum\u201D, but few would deny\
  \ that those ravings have had profound resonance, especially, but not exclusively,\
  \ in cormorant-world.\nWhat of the three other Biblical cormorants? Well, there\
  \ is the Leviticus Cormorant, which appears in this passage:\nThese are they which\
  \ ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are\
  \ an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, And the vulture,\
  \ and the kite after his kind; Every raven after his kind; And the owl, and the\
  \ night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, And the little owl, and\
  \ the cormorant, and the great owl, And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier\
  \ eagle, And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\
  \ All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.\n\
  The Deuteronomy Cormorant is not dissimilar, as we learn here:\nOf all clean birds\
  \ ye shall eat. But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and ossifrage,\
  \ and the ospray, And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, And\
  \ every raven after his kind, And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and\
  \ the hawk after his kind, The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, And\
  \ the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, And the stork, and the heron\
  \ after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. And every creeping thing that flieth\
  \ is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten. But of all clean fowls ye may eat.\n\
  Then there is the Isaiah Cormorant, which we met yesterday, and finally the Zephaniah\
  \ Cormorant:\nYe Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. And he will stretch\
  \ out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation,\
  \ and dry like a wilderness. And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all\
  \ the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the\
  \ upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be\
  \ in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.\nSo similar are the Leviticus\
  \ Cormorant and the Deuteronomy Cormorant, on the one hand, and the Isaiah Cormorant\
  \ and the Zephaniah Cormorant, on the other, that some theologians and cormorantologists\
  \ have argued that there are only two cormorants in the Bible, not four. The cultural\
  \ and historical implications of this view are immense, even world-shuddering. If\
  \ your brain is made dizzy by just thinking about it, I recommend a thorough study\
  \ of Dobson's pamphlet How Many Cormorants Are There In The Bible? (out of print).\n\
