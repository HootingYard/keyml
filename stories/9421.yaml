text: "Facecloth, which some people continue to insist on calling Facebook in spite\
  \ of my cajoling, grows ever more ubiquitous. At times it really does seem to have\
  \ taken over the world. Efforts by others to supplant it\u2014Google+ for example\u2014\
  have only limited success, and I think this may be because the alternatives so far\
  \ are too similar to Facecloth. There is also the fact that Zuckerberg and his minions\
  \ adapt their monolith to ape the best features of their competitors. What this\
  \ suggests to me is that if there is to be a social networking site that can consign\
  \ Facecloth to the dustbin of history, it will have to be so far in advance of the\
  \ original that little Mark will take one look at it, burst into tears, dismantle\
  \ his entire operation, and retire from the fray. I think I have now come up with\
  \ the goods, daddy-o.\nMy insight was granted by going back to basics, and considering\
  \ the original name, Facecloth. Sorry, Facebook. As far as I am aware, this refers\
  \ to the practice of American higher education colleges of issuing yearbooks containing\
  \ snapshots and potted biographies of their students. Little Mark took that very\
  \ simple format as the building block for world domination. But therein\u2014I realised\u2014\
  lie the seeds of his destruction. Break the word in two. Face. Book. It is all so\
  \ damned two-dimensional. Photographs of faces, gathered in a book of flat pages\
  \ with printed words. It is just not good enough, even when modified and complicated\
  \ and transformed into a global phenomenon on Het Internet. It seems clear to me\
  \ that the whole thing needs to be shifted up into three dimensions. And that is\
  \ the beauty of Headbag!\nJust think. Why be satisfied with the face when you could\
  \ have the whole head? And what kind of nincompoop would be happy with a book of\
  \ flat paper pages when they could have a bag packed with solid objects? It is so\
  \ blindingly obvious I am surprised nobody has thought of it before.\nBut perhaps\
  \ they have, and have raised objections. After all, if you are going to stuff a\
  \ bag full of heads, where are you going to get the heads from? We do not want to\
  \ encourage those Islamist nutcases whose greatest joy in life, when not persecuting\
  \ women, is to chop off the heads of infidels. But, using the kind of lateral thinking\
  \ espoused by geniuses like Edward \u201CSix Hats\u201D De Bono, we need not cram\
  \ our bag with human heads. Instead, we can use cabbages as a substitute. Carefully\
  \ picked, cabbage heads are about the weight, size, and shape of human heads, and\
  \ if you are pernickety you can always draw facial features on the cabbage with\
  \ a magic marker, and apply a variety of superb and exciting hairstyles with cotton\
  \ wool and glue. It is then a simple case of shoving, say, half a dozen or even\
  \ a baker's dozen of cabbages into a burlap sack of the appropriate size, and voila!,\
  \ you have signed up to Headbag. You will receive a confirmatory metal tapping machine\
  \ message, to which you should respond using a special code to demonstrate that\
  \ you are a real person, toting a real bag, filled with real cabbages. Once that\
  \ is received and processed and filed away in a filing cabinet drawer at Headbag\
  \ HQ, you are off and away!\nWhat we found, in our preliminary research, was that\
  \ the best way to network with other Headbag users was to find a suitable three-dimensional\
  \ real-world location and to gather there, each of you with your burlap sack of\
  \ cabbages. Caves, particularly caves by the seaside, proved to be the best spots\
  \ of all. A particular advantage is that they tend not to be haunted by anybody\
  \ else. Vagrants, drunks, and riff-raff are all more likely to be found slumped\
  \ in municipal parks and on the outskirts of leisure and retail facilities, whereas\
  \ the caves we reconnoitred were empty. Occasionally there might be a small creeping\
  \ creature of dubious provenance scuttling about, but they can always be stamped\
  \ on or, if of a somewhat larger bulk, sprayed with a canister of some death-delivering\
  \ chemical compound. When the cave is properly vacant, it makes for a splendid meeting-place\
  \ for Headbag users. You might want to take along a torch or a Tilly lamp, and a\
  \ packed lunch.\nThere are all sorts of rewarding ways that a group of persons each\
  \ with a bag full of cabbages can interact. You probably don't need me to tell you\
  \ what they are. In fact, doing so would fatally undermine the sheer beauty of the\
  \ Headbag experience, which is posited on giving users full control. There is none\
  \ of that sneaky shenanigans going on in the background that you get with Facecloth.\
  \ None of your details will be passed to sinister multinational corporations. You\
  \ will not find a data trail linking you to unseemly or criminal activities. No,\
  \ with Headbag, you can be sure your privacy is safe. You sit in a cave, by the\
  \ sea, with other users, clutching your sack of cabbages, and do whatever you want\
  \ to do, without Headbag HQ interfering in any way. All we ask is that you be very\
  \ careful to scarper before the tide comes in, flooding the cave, as tides tend\
  \ to do.\nOne question that often crops up at our marketing seminars is how we will\
  \ make sufficient money from Headbag to reduce little Mark Zuckerberg to comparative\
  \ penury and have him come grovelling to our door with a begging bowl. In the interests\
  \ of robust transparency, I should point out that your burlap sack will carry advertising,\
  \ stencilled on using luminous ink or paint which will be visible in the dank darkness\
  \ of your cave. That is our only concession to the commercial realm. Please do not\
  \ believe any stories you read in the press that we have plans to force users to\
  \ rent their cabbages from us. You are free to buy them from your local greengrocer's\
  \ or hypermarket, or even to grow them yourself on your allotment, out beyond the\
  \ viaduct by the railway tracks. That is the Headbag way, like it or lump it.\n\
  Onward to world domination!\n[2012-06-13]"
