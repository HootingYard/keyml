text: "Unconfined glee here at Hooting Yard following our discovery of the Finnish\
  \ Men's Shouting Choir. Here is an extract from the sleeve notes to the Tenth Anniversary\
  \ Concert CD (itself ten years old):\nWhat would it be like to assemble a maximal\
  \ number of men into a regular formation and dress them in dark suits, black rubber\
  \ ties (made of used inner tubes), white shirts, and make them furiously shout some\
  \ patriotic texts sacred to the Finns?\nNow we know. I learn from the website that\
  \ their repertoire soon extended to children's ditties, worker's songs, national\
  \ anthems and quotes from Finnish laws and international treaties. The choir has\
  \ performed in \u201Cchamber music halls, rock festivals, jazz clubs, choir festivals,\
  \ art galleries and museums, railway stations, supermarkets, construction sites,\
  \ Olympic stadiums, occupied houses, mountaintops, ocean shores and wet swamps\u201D\
  , apparently.\nWatch them here. Superb.\n[2008-01-19]"
