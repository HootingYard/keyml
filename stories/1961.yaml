text: "According to the old adage, \u201Cthe best banisters are the sturdiest banisters\u201D\
  . There is a great deal of wisdom in this simple phrase, as many unsteady persons\
  \ who may otherwise have toppled to their deaths can attest. But it is a saying\
  \ which has been wilfully ignored by trendy banistermaker Tim Snap, who is peddling\
  \ his latest design, a banister rail made of crepe paper thickened with cow gum.\
  \ We sent a roving Hooting Yard reporter to interview Mr Snap.\nReporter\_: I am\
  \ astonished to see you leaning insouciantly against your crepe paper and cow gum\
  \ banisters, Tim, given they are all that stands between you and a yawning stairwell\
  \ down which you could plunge to your death.\nSnap\_: You should add, for the benefit\
  \ of your readers, that I am leaning my full weight against the banisters.\nReporter\_\
  : If you don't mind me saying so, Tim, you are quite a chubby banistermaker, so\
  \ there must be quite a bit of weight for your banisters to support.\nSnap\_: That\
  \ is indeed so.\nReporter\_: If I were to give you a shove, in a joshing sort of\
  \ manner, as between a couple of pals, would your banister withstand the added pressure\
  \ suddenly put upon it?\nSnap\_: I certainly hope so.\nReporter\_: Let's test it\
  \ shall we?\nSnap\_: Well, before you do, please note that this new banister rail,\
  \ like all my banisters, is primarily decorative.\nReporter\_: Are you trying to\
  \ wheedle your way out of my shoving test?\nSnap\_: Quite frankly, yes.\nReporter\_\
  : I think that tells us all we need to know.\nThere is, you see, a point to those\
  \ old adages, and a reason why they have survived. They express truths, both big\
  \ and little truths. So when next you come upon a snaggle-toothed peasant sitting\
  \ on a fence chewing a piece of straw and mumbling a litany of folk wisdom, do not\
  \ dismiss what they say. Sometimes their sayings may seem to be blithering nonsense,\
  \ as for example \u201CA pig on the lane can cause you a sprain\u201D or \u201C\
  When you see a door ajar, tug your forelock to the Master up at the Big House\u201D\
  . If you reflect for long enough even upon the most ludicrous-seeming utterance,\
  \ you will eventually bow to its wisdom. And you will be much less likely to fork\
  \ over your cash to a pretentious git like Tim Snap who, our reporter revealed,\
  \ was supported over that vertiginous stairwell not by his crepe paper and cow gum\
  \ banisters, but by a system of invisible winches and pulleys. Let that be a lesson\
  \ to you.\nYou will almost certainly want to know more about cow gum. The great\
  \ Tim Hunkin tells us this:\n\nand you should refer to his majestic\_ Rudiments\
  \ Of Wisdom Encyclopaedia for much else besides.\n[2009-03-02]"
