  \ comment, here is another. I will not be making a habit of this, but last night's\
  \ brief exchange of comments with Elberry is, I think, worth noting here.\nI chuckled\
  \ at a comment I read appended to a postage on the Grauniad's Comment Is Free site,\
  \ and so, on Facecloth, noted\nA Comment Is Free comment over at The Grauniad\_\
  : \u201CGroan, and so the Guardian descends still further into being an upmarket\
  \ version of Black Flag for the under 16s.\u201D I chuckled.\nThe subsequent dialogue\
  \ with Elberry went as follows\nElberry\_: more on the nature of this chuckling\
  \ please, the sound, duration, effect on passers-by, etc.\nFrank Key : Grating and\
  \ somehow tragic, forty-nine seconds, solicitude, offers of loose change, thumpings.\n\
  Elberry\_: does it excite frenzies, sexual or otherwise?\nFrank Key : Only in the\
  \ raddled hearts of the unseemly\nElberry\_: is it pure to the pure, if the pure\
  \ are privy to these terrible eruptions?\nFrank Key\_: Alas, there are tincts\n\
  Elberry\_: would you consider removing these safeguards, so the many- headed rabble\
  \ may hark to your mirth, and take heart therefrom?\nFrank Key\_: I will consider\
  \ it, while my head is upon the pillow, and I snooze, imminently\nAfter tippy-tapping\
  \ which, I retired to bed, rested my head upon the pillow, and snoozed. Alas, I\
  \ did not after all consider removing any chuckle safeguards.\n[2011-11-17]"
