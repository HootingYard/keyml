text: 'It is now quite clear that, since the inauguration of Barack Obama as Potus,
  we can all rest easy in our beds. For I learn that Obama keeps on his desk an Egg
  Of Power.

  Could it be that, when he publishes his presidential diaries in years to come, Obama
  will take a leaf out of George Orwell''s book, and give us simply a daily status
  report on the egg?

  January 31. One egg. But it is the Egg of Power!

  The Oval Office may be renamed the Ova Office, and Alfred Hitchcock will be rolling
  in his grave.
