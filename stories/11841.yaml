text: "Bloody hell! How could I allow an entire week to elapse without a single postage?\
  \ For the Tremoloes, silence may have been golden, but I think we can all agree\
  \ that Hooting Yard silence is decidedly leaden. God alone knows how you lot have\
  \ managed to cope in the absence of the one bright spark in your otherwise pitiful\
  \ and wretched lives.\nI wish I could tell you that during the preceding week I\
  \ have been engaged in some important business\u2014Milibanding with International\
  \ Rescue, for example\u2014but alas! and alack! it is not so. I have simply been\
  \ engulfed in tippy-tappyless lassitude.\nMind you, one thing I did was to read\
  \ George Simenon's 1967 novel The Neighbours, and I am very glad I did. The protagonist\
  \ is a Parisian travel agent, who at one point says to his subordinate:\n\u201C\
  Monsieur Clinche, would you come here for a minute? I think we recently received\
  \ a letter from Bill Hatworn, our Kenya correspondent,\u201D\nTragically, this is\
  \ the sole mention of Bill Hatworn in the novel and, indeed, in all world literature.\
  \ We learn nothing, nothing whatsoever, about him, not even the contents of that\
  \ letter, which Monsieur Clinche has \u201Calready filed\u201D. Surely, having invented\
  \ a character with such a resounding name\u2014one which we must presume he considered\
  \ typically Anglo-Saxon\u2014Simenon ought to have bashed out a series of novels\
  \ about him and his doings in Kenya? Clearly it must fall to me to rescue Mr Hatworn\
  \ from obscurity and to write all those exciting adventures myself.\nFirst up, I\
  \ suppose, will have to be Bill Hatworn\u2014Kenya Correspondent! to introduce our\
  \ hero to readers. Next, I think I will take inspiration from a poster I saw for\
  \ a new blockbuster multiplex piece of cinematic twaddle (see below) and write Bill\
  \ Hatworn And The Foolish People Of The Future! I may indeed pen a spin-off series\
  \ about the Foolish People Of The Future, in which they dash about in the future\
  \ doing futuristic things with futuristic weaponry while dressed in futuristic uniforms.\n\
