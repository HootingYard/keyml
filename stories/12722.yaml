text: "\nIn 1946, Sylvia Townsend Warner\u2014superb novelist and archetypal posh\
  \ communist\u2014received, as a Christmas present from Alyse Gregory, an empty matchbox.\
  \ This is her letter of thanks:\n23:xii:1946\nDearest Alyse,\nUsually one begins\
  \ a thank-letter by some graceless comparison, by saying, I have never been given\
  \ such a very scarlet muffler, or, This is the largest horse I have ever been sent\
  \ for Christmas. But your matchbox is a nonpareil, for never in my life have I been\
  \ given a matchbox. Stamps, yes, drawing-pins, yes, balls of string, yes, yes, menacingly\
  \ too often; but never a matchbox. Now that it has happened I ask myself why it\
  \ has never happened before. They are such charming things, neat as wrens, and what\
  \ a deal of ingenuity and human artfulness has gone into their construction; for\
  \ if they were like the ordinary box with a lid they would not be one half so convenient.\
  \ This one though is especially neat, charming, and ingenious, and the tray slides\
  \ in and out as though Chippendale had made it.\nBut what I like best of all about\
  \ my matchbox is that it is an empty one. I have often thought how much I should\
  \ enjoy being given an empty house in Norway, what pleasure it would be to walk\
  \ into those bare wood-smelling chambers, walls, floor, ceiling, all wood, which\
  \ is after all the natural shelter of man, or at any rate the most congenial. And\
  \ when I opened your matchbox which is now my matchbox and saw that beautiful clean\
  \ sweet-smelling empty rectangular expanse it was exactly as though my house in\
  \ Norway had come true; with the added advantage of being just the right size to\
  \ carry in my hand. I shut my imagination up in it instantly, and it is still sitting\
  \ there, listening to the wind in the firwood outside. Sitting there in a couple\
  \ of days time I shall hear the Lutheran bell calling me to go and sing Lutheran\
  \ hymns while the pastor's wife gazes abstractedly at her husband in a bower of\
  \ evergreen while she wonders if she remembered to put pepper in the goose-stuffing;\
  \ but I shan't go, I shall be far too happy sitting in my house that Alyse gave\
  \ me for Christmas.\nOh, I must tell you I have finished my book\u2014begun in 1941\
  \ and a hundred times imperilled but finished at last. So I can give an undivided\
  \ mind to enjoying my matchbox.\n(Signed)\nP.S. There is still so much to say\u2026\
  carried away by my delight in form and texture I forgot to praise the picture on\
  \ the back. I have never seen such an agreeable likeness of a hedgehog, and the\
  \ volcano in the background is magnificent.\nThe Letters of Sylvia Townsend Warner,\
