text: "For a couple of years early in the present century I had a mobile phone. By\
  \ current standards it was a clunky and primitive affair, on which I was able to\
  \ make telephone calls (which I did), send text messages (which I rarely did) and\
  \ play a few games (which I never did). One day the rental period expired and I\
  \ did not immediately renew it, nor did I investigate any shorter-term or pay-as-you-go\
  \ options. I put the phone in my desk drawer where it nestles still, gathering dust.\n\
  Owning a laptop and being a constant user of what our Belgian pals call Het Internet,\
  \ it would be both preposterous and pretentious to call myself a latterday Luddite.\
  \ But the laptop is, I think, the only thing I own which marks me as a citizen of\
  \ the twenty-first century. Discounting the unused mobile (itself a 1990s model)\
  \ which, it is true, could be juddered back to life (I assume), I have nothing else\
  \ that I couldn't have owned in, say, 1960. I have no television or microwave oven\
  \ or digital camera or any other space age devices. This is not a conscious pose,\
  \ a foolhardy attempt to be a living anachronism. I am, for example, perfectly happy\
  \ to use teabags rather than leaf tea (though how I miss the tea strainer as a numinous\
  \ everyday object!). It is simply that I find it possible to live a contented life\
  \ without all this stuff. And whenever I sit on a bus and watch people jabbing at\
  \ the tiny keyboards on their devices, or listen to them jabbering away on their\
  \ phones, and when I can restrain myself from throwing a pocketful of pebbles at\
  \ their heads, I am reminded that I am better off without these things, and that\
  \ one day I am going to take that old mobile phone out of the desk drawer and throw\
  \ it in the bin, or crush it underfoot, or donate it to a passing mendicant.\nBut\
  \ as I say, the laptop is an essential part of my life, one I would miss much, much\
  \ more than I miss tea strainers. And it is because I am an online kinda guy that\
  \ I am aware of such things as apps, which as far as I can gather are the multitudinous\
  \ wonders available\u2014essential\u2014for mobile phones and smart phones and iPads\
  \ and tablet PCs and whatever else the digital person-about-town is jabbing and\
  \ gazing at and jabbering into. So it seems to me only right that in this brave\
  \ new world there really ought to be a Hooting Yard app, even though I wouldn't\
  \ use it myself. The question is, what in the name of all the saints in heaven would\
  \ a Hooting Yard app actually do?\nIt has occurred to me, you see, to employ a gaggle\
  \ of unpaid interns to work\u2014tirelessly, chained in a cellar, fed on slops\u2014\
  on the development of the Hooting Yard app. The technology, of course, holds no\
  \ terrors for these young persons. They might gawp uncomprehendingly at a tea strainer,\
  \ but the creation of an app comes as naturally to them as breathing. Nevertheless,\
  \ in their plaintive little voices, they pipe up \u201CWhat is it you want the Hooting\
  \ Yard app to do, Mr Key, innit?\u201D And thus far I have no answer ready for them.\
  \ (Though in a happy moment I did consider the possibility that my app might deliver\
  \ a disabling electric shock to the user upon their each and every utterance of\
  \ the barbarism \u201Cinnit\u201D.)\nHaving got this far, however, and recognising\
  \ that a world without a Hooting Yard app is a world not worth living in, I feel\
  \ I must plough on, indefatigably. But the interns will grow restive when they have\
  \ completed the interim project with which I have fobbed them off, the development\
  \ of the iTea Strainer. So I am appealing to the constituency of Hooting Yard readers\
  \ and listeners to drum up ideas. You will, I am sure, have been sat there, jabbing\
  \ and gazing at and jabbering into your device, always with that nagging thought\
  \ at the back of your puny pea-sized brain that, however exciting and versatile\
  \ and efficient and entertaining your pad or pod or digithingummyjig, its true potential\
  \ has yet to be unleashed, because what it really needs, to justify its very existence,\
  \ let alone its cost, is to have inserted into its electronic innards the app of\
  \ apps, the Hooting Yard app.\nWhen you have worked out what it will do, let me\
  \ know, and I will tell the interns, by way of a note scribbled in pencil on a scrap\
  \ of paper rolled up and sent through pneumatic tube down to the cellar.\n[2012-01-16]"
