text: "One of the more unusual features of Pointy Town is that its sots and topers\
  \ gather in beer palaces and gin gardens, rather than the more familiar vice versas.\
  \ This idiosyncratic arrangement of drinking dens is thought to date back to the\
  \ time of Robin Hod, the bricklaying outlaw dressed all in green, who stole from\
  \ a ditch to give to a Boer. Who knew there were Boers in Pointy Town? It is possible\
  \ that I have misheard or misunderstood the legend, wittered at me by a passing\
  \ storyteller I met on a beaten track, and that Robin Hod fenced his stolen goods\
  \ to a boor, or even a bore. There are plenty of both in Pointy Town, as you quickly\
  \ learn if you spend any time in one of the beer palaces or gin gardens. What has\
  \ always puzzled me, more than the possible colony of expat Boers in Pointy Town,\
  \ is the nature of Robin Hod's ditch theft. I mean, what could you come upon in\
  \ the average ditch that would be worth stealing? Some mud? Brackish puddle water\
  \ rife with tiny wriggling beings? A broken and rusty and abandoned pram or bicycle?\
  \ Certainly not the latter, for the ditches of Pointy Town are famously free of\
  \ such unsightly excrescences, swept clean, or clean-ish, as they are, once a week,\
  \ on a rotation system, by the Pointy Town Ditch Maintenance Patrol. It is thought\
  \ that Robin Hod recruited his so-called \u201Cmerry men\u201D from the ranks of\
  \ disaffected or incapable Ditch Patrol has-beens. He tried to teach them bricklaying,\
  \ but the lure of the beer palaces and gin gardens was too powerful. It was almost\
  \ magnetic, if you can imagine such a thing.\n[2010-09-16]"
