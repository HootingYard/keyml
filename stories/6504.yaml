text: "Prompted by his recent piece in The Dabbler, I decided to improve my ornithological\
  \ knowledge by reading Tim Birkhead's The Wisdom Of Birds. And lo! that is how I\
  \ began my Easter Sunday on this sunny morning, to the sound of cawing crows outside.\n\
  \nI am afraid to say I am ready to hurl the book across the room in exasperation.\
  \ This is an expensive and lavishly-produced Bloomsbury book, and by page 18 I have\
  \ fought my way past no fewer than three howling typos: a missing indefinite article\
  \ on page 2, \u201Cwho\u201D for \u201Chow\u201D on page 6, and \u201Cknow\u201D\
  \ for \u201Cknown\u201D on page 18. This is proofreading-by-spellcheck, and it simply\
  \ isn't good enough.\nI shall persevere, for the time being. But this slipshod approach\
  \ fatally undermines the pleasure of reading, for me. Tim Birkhead has been ill-served\
  \ by his publishers. I'd insist on getting the whole print-run pulped and starting\
  \ again, with a competent copy editor.\nUPDATE\_: Still on page 18, and another\
  \ one!\u2014\u201Cprinciple\u201D where what is meant is \u201Cprincipal\u201D.\n\
