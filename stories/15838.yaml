text: "Dear BBC Radio Four\nI am a keen and regular listener to Tweet Of The Day,\
  \ your two-minute programme devoted to birds and birdsong broadcast each weekday\
  \ morning at the ungodly hour of 5.58. I have grown used to beginning my day having\
  \ my ears delighted by the various trills, chirps, chirrups, caws, squawks, tweets,\
  \ etcetera etcetera of our avian pals. Thus I was mightily disconcerted, this morning,\
  \ to hear not a bird but a bat.\nI charged the unpaid interns of the Hooting Yard\
  \ Ornithological Research Bureau with the task of checking these things for me,\
  \ and the crippled yet sprightly orphans toiling away in the cellar reported back,\
  \ toot sweet, that, as I suspected, a bat is not a bird. Unless you have renamed\
  \ the series Airborne Mammalian Squeak Of The Day, this is simply unfathomable.\n\
  Please ensure that your editor studies carefully this diagram of a bird, to avoid\
  \ committing the same blunder in the future.\n\nYours peevishly,\nFrank Key\n\n\
  Dear Mr Key\nThank you for your peevish complaint. Recent developments at the BBC\
  \ have clearly escaped your notice. You may know that the inaugural Director General\
  \ of the Corporation was a God-fearing Scotchman of great rectitude, Lord Reith.\
  \ Following a conference held in a grim granite chapel perched on a windswept promontory,\
  \ the senior management vowed to jettison all that leftie politically correct Gramscian\
  \ Marxist poppycock and return the BBC to stern-jawed Reithian values informed by\
  \ Christian ethics.\nHenceforth Christ is our guide, and the Bible is His Word,\
  \ and it is abundantly clear from the Bible that the bat is a bird. I refer you\
  \ to Leviticus 11:13\u201319.\nAnd these are they which ye shall have in abomination\
  \ among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,\
  \ and the ossifrage, and the ospray, And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;\
  \ Every raven after his kind; And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and\
  \ the hawk after his kind, And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great\
  \ owl, And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, And the stork, the heron\
  \ after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\nI trust this clarifies the matter,\
  \ and that you will repent of your sins. May the Lord bless you and keep you, or\
  \ smite you and chastise you, as in His infinite wisdom He sees fit.\nYours in Christ,\n\
  The Rev. Ninian Tonguelash\nBBC Ornithology & Theology Inquisitor General\n[2017-10-31]"
