text: "On this day, eight long years ago, I asked some questions about Gilead:\nIs\
  \ there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Is the chemist's shop shut?\
  \ Has the clinic been boarded up? Why does the Ambulance of Gilead sit rusted in\
  \ a locked and bolted garage, its siren broken and its tyres punctured flat? What\
  \ happened to all that balm anyway? Was it stolen by a ruthless gang of aromatic\
  \ resin smugglers? Did the gang abduct the physician as part of the plan? Was the\
  \ local television station prompted to show Celebrity Balm In Gilead Sniffer Dog\
  \ Challenge? Did the massed bloodhounds and their permatanned owners fail to find\
  \ even the merest trace of resin? Did the gang succeed in carting off all the balm\
  \ in Gilead to their mountain lair? What are we to make of the conjecture in the\
  \ press that the physician's abduction was a piece of fakery and that he was the\
  \ mastermind behind the plot? How long did it take for a hack on the Daily Shackle\
  \ to dub the affair Balmingileadgate? Will there ever again be balm in Gilead? Who\
  \ is the young whippersnapper who has arrived, announcing himself as the replacement\
  \ physician? Is there something reproachful and oily about his manner? Why does\
  \ he keep referring to the missing balm as \u201Cgumme\u201D or \u201Ctriacle\u201D\
  ? Is he unable to spell \u201Ctreacle\u201D, or is he up to something? Why does\
  \ he refuse to divulge the recipe for the bandage paste he uses? Is he in league\
  \ with his predecessor, and with his predecessor's alleged gang? Is there any connection\
  \ between the fact that the new oily physician has put posters up all over the place\
  \ promising to rid the populace of \u201Cevil humours\u201D and that \u201Cmalign\
  \ bile ad\u201D is an anagram of \u201Cbalm in Gilead\u201D? What on earth is that\
  \ stuff the new physician smears on his hair? Must it pong so offensively? Has he\
  \ no shame? If you know the answers to any of these questions, or can assist the\
  \ Gilead medical authorities in any way, please write to the Balm In Gilead Appeal\
  \ c/o Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb.\nAs I say, eight years have passed since\
  \ I posed those questions. Today I found myself wondering if Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb\
  \ had made any progress. Some of you may recall the Detective Captain from the part\
  \ he played in what became known as the affair of the immense duckpond pamphlet.\
  \ For those of you who do not recall, here is an account of his arrival upon the\
  \ scene:\nThe next day all hell broke loose. Early in the morning, as Blodgett polished\
  \ the outside spigots, an ogre or wild man hove into view atop the southern hills.\
  \ Its progress towards the House was implacable. It stamped through the bracken,\
  \ vaulted the ha-ha with a single bound, negotiated the massive basalt wall with\
  \ surprising elegance, and sprang towards the terrified Blodgett, whirling its hirsute\
  \ arms alarmingly and making disgusting guttural noises. It was matted with filth.\
  \ Flies, gnats, and tiny things emitting poisonous goo crawled all over its flesh.\
  \ It seemed to be decomposing. It drooled. It picked up Blodgett, sank its fangs\
  \ into his skull, and hurled him aside.\nPausing momentarily to spit out particles\
  \ of Blodgett's head, it smashed its way through the wall of the House, oblivious\
  \ to the fact that there was an ajar door three feet to its right. Once inside the\
  \ House, its rage seemed to increase. It rushed wildly from room to room, obliterating\
  \ the furniture, tearing up floorboards, destroying chandeliers, bashing holes into\
  \ walls and ceilings, sucking the wallpaper off the walls. It chewed up banister\
  \ rails and regurgitated them, disgorging them with such force that each rail acted\
  \ as a lethal projectile. At least one urchin was impaled as a result. Five minutes\
  \ after the ogre's arrival much of the lower part of the House lay in ruins. Small\
  \ fires were starting, but they were doused by water spurting from uprooted taps.\n\
  Euwige and Jubble were still sprawled in the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns\
  \ when the ogre eventually came upon them. It let out an inhuman cry. It picked\
  \ at its sores. It became becalmed. Fixing it with a bemused stare, Jubble rose\
  \ to his feet.\n\u201CYou know, there might still be some dandelion and burdock\
  \ left,\u201D he said, \u201CWould you care for a drop?\u201D\nThe ogre pounded\
  \ its fists against its own head. Then it blinked, shuddered, twitched. Jubble pushed\
  \ a tin mug into its paw. It gulped the sweet muck down greedily, then threw the\
  \ mug back at Jubble, missing his ear by a whisker, as they say. Something in its\
  \ manner seemed to change. By now, blind Euwige too was on her feet. She sniffed\
  \ at the violent pongs emanating from the ogre, then stepped towards it.\n\u201C\
  Thank heaven! You have come!\u201D she said, \u201CJubble, meet my dear friend Detective\
  \ Captain Unstrebnodtalb! He comes from a far country, and his brain is hot.\u201D\
  \nI knew that these days Unstrebnodtalb was based in some sort of new-fangled police\
  \ kiosk perched on a promontory overlooking the wild and broiling sea. I caught\
  \ a bus and then trudged the last mile or two until I was in sight of the kiosk.\
  \ The Detective Captain was sitting in a deckchair outside, staring at the sea,\
  \ a bit like King Canute but high on a promontory rather than down on the beach,\
  \ and thus not in any danger of being o'erswept by the briny. As I approached, I\
  \ hailed him.\n\u201CAny news on that balm in Gilead business?\u201D I asked, getting\
  \ straight to the point. Then I saw that he was weeping.\n\u201CHave you ever read\
  \ The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford?\u201D he asked, in his grunty way.\n\u201C\
  Yes, I have,\u201D I said.\n\u201CThen you will know it begins with the line \u2018\
  This is the saddest story I have ever heard\u2019. Well, that may be true for Ford\
  \ Madox Ford, but not for me, Detective Captain Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb, for I\
  \ have heard a story even sadder.\u201D\n\u201CI didn't know your first names were\
  \ Ford and Madox,\u201D I said.\nHe waved a paw at me.\n\u201CIn pursuing the case\
  \ of the missing balm in Gilead I have been driven to ruination and despair and\
  \ sitting on a deckchair next to a new-fangled police kiosk perched on a promontory\
  \ staring at the sea and weeping, because it is all so very, very sad,\u201D he\
  \ said.\n\u201CYes, but have you answered any of the questions?\u201D I asked, mercilessly.\n\
  \u201CCome back in another eight years and ask me again,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd\
  \ now leave me to weep.\u201D\nA gull swooped in to scavenge breadcrusts from the\
  \ kiosk roof. I turned and trudged back to the bus stop. Instead of going home,\
  \ I stayed on the bus as far as Gilead. There was still no balm.\n[2012-07-26]"
