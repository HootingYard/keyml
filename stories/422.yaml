text: "Our first example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching took place\
  \ in a pantry cluttered with jars in much disorder. Some of the jars contained goo\
  \ or curd or pips or suet, in varying quantities, and some of the jars were empty.\
  \ None were clean. All the jars had a coating of grime, as if they had lain untouched\
  \ for many moons, as indeed they had, for this was an abandoned pantry. The lids\
  \ of the jars would not have been easy to loosen had a determined person entered\
  \ the pantry bent upon loosening the lid of any one of the jars, perhaps to eke\
  \ out some goo or curd or pips or suet, or perhaps to pour into one of the empty\
  \ jars a new and exciting substance. And hark! Here comes such a person, a wheezing\
  \ person stomping down the passage towards the pantry and kicking the door in. He\
  \ is a liveried attendant gone to seed and become a brute and he is holding a hammer.\
  \ He has come to smash all the jars in the pantry for he has lost all sense of decorum.\
  \ And then an Angel of the Lord appears, all a-shimmer, and commands him to lay\
  \ down his hammer and leave the cluttered jars untouched. This is when the person\
  \ begins flapping about and twitching uncontrollably, for about thirty seconds,\
  \ in fear and shame, before fleeing the abandoned pantry. That happened on a Thursday.\n\
  The second example involves a peasant and a cow and many bees. It was a Saturday.\
  \ The peasant had trudged into the field to take a close look at the cow, for the\
  \ cow had been fractious and the peasant was concerned. Though unlettered, the peasant\
  \ had a goodly store of country wisdom and was confident that if the cow was sick\
  \ he would be able to identify the nature of its malady and cure it. Like many a\
  \ tragic hero in fiction, the peasant sought redemption for an enormity in his past,\
  \ an enormity committed due to a character flaw. Careful study of tragic heroes\
  \ will reveal that they often have such a flaw. One thinks of Coriolanus, for example,\
  \ or Dobson. Neither the nature of the peasant's fatal flaw, nor of the enormity\
  \ for which he sought redemption, need concern us here, for this is not a tragedy,\
  \ it is just an example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. In any case,\
  \ it is reportage rather than fiction. That being so, the reader is entitled to\
  \ hard facts, rigorously researched, and the winnowing out of all fluffiness. That\
  \ is why I have employed a Hooting Yard Fact-Checker so you can be absolutely sure\
  \ that what you read here is the pure and unvarnished truth. Obviously you need\
  \ to have confidence in the person charged with the fact-checking, and that is why\
  \ I fought hard to get someone for the job who I know can be relied upon. Yes, it\
  \ is easy to laugh at an ex-schoolteacher pushing sixty who still wishes to be known\
  \ as \u201CSting\u201D, but this was the man, remember, who first pointed out to\
  \ the world that \u201CRussians love their children too\u201D. It is just such acuity\
  \ of insight that makes him perfect for the job I have employed him to do, and for\
  \ which I pay him a pittance each month. \u201CSting\u201D has promised to set up\
  \ a separate Hooting Yard Fact Check website, so we can all look forward to that.\n\
  I ought to point out here that, just as you can rely on me (and \u201CSting\u201D\
  ) to provide you with big tough facts, so in return I expect a degree of attentiveness\
  \ from you. Toe-tapping, head-scratching, and sloshing out of the ears with some\
  \ sort of wax-crumbling fluid, these can surely wait until my report is done. That\
  \ is the bargain we strike.\nNow we've got that cleared up, like a rash, we can\
  \ return to the peasant and the cow and the bees. But wait! You will want to be\
  \ sure that they are bees, and not hornets, or wasps. Wait for a minute while I\
  \ fire off a quick instruction to \u201CSting\u201D to check up on that. Hmm. I\
  \ have just realised how apposite his absurd nickname is for such a task.\nOK. I\
  \ have sent my missive and imagine that, as I write, \u201CSting\u201D is checking\
  \ his encyclopaedias and databases and whatnot. Unless I tell you otherwise, you\
  \ can assume that the bees we are about to encounter in our second example of uncontrollable\
  \ flapping about and twitching are indeed bees.\nSo the peasant with the tragic\
  \ flaw trudged into the field to look at the cow, hoping to ascertain the nature\
  \ of its sickness. Because it was a Saturday, the field was muddier than usual.\
  \ The cow was standing more or less in the centre of the field, gazing at nothingness\
  \ in a cow-like way. Its hocks had lost their shine, and the cardboard tag stapled\
  \ to one of its ears was smudged. In this day and age, it is quite common for cows\
  \ to have pieces of cardboard or plastic stapled to their ears, serving a number\
  \ of purposes, and the staplers used are not so different from the staplers used\
  \ in offices up and down the land. \u201CSting\u201D told me that.\nAs he approached\
  \ the cow, the peasant tried to dredge from his brain some of the folk wisdom with\
  \ which it had been crammed since infancy. He remembered \u201CIf your cow is sick\
  \ on a Monday morning / Go and spit upon a spade just as the day is dawning\u201D\
  , but that was no use to him, as it was Saturday. He remembered \u201CCow, cow,\
  \ blotchy and stiff / Spray it with a bottle of Jif\u201D, but that particular spell\
  \ lost its efficacy when Jif products were renamed Cif as part of a marketing exercise\
  \ early in the 21st century. And he remembered \u201CYour cow is sick, it's got\
  \ bird flu / But the Russians love their children too\u201D. As a piece of countryside\
  \ lore this was useless, of course, as it did not suggest any remedies for the sick\
  \ cow, but it is evidence of the extent to which the terrific profundities spouted\
  \ by my fact-checking employee have entered the collective wisdom of the world.\n\
  Be that as it may, before the peasant got a chance to inspect the cow, a swarm of\
  \ bees came in from the west, and buzzed menacingly about his head. Cue his uncontrollable\
  \ flapping about and twitching, perfectly understandable in the circumstances. The\
  \ bees harried the peasant until he turned tail and fled the field on that Saturday\
  \ morning. The cow, by the way, had only a minor ailment, from which it recovered\
  \ without human intervention, although I understand that it is currently in a cow-based\
  \ twelve-step programme in an adjoining field. As for the peasant, he would have\
  \ to await a new challenge to redeem himself from the peccadillos of his past, whatever\
  \ they were.\nWe move on now, breathlessly but with vigour, to the third of our\
  \ examples of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. Forget pantries, forget\
  \ peasants, this is a case of unearthly sci-fi stuff, set on a spaceship roaring\
  \ through galaxies unimaginably distant, on a Tuesday evening. Captain Biff Bucklebim\
  \ is at the controls on the deck of the USS Milquetoast Jesuit. He is a bit like\
  \ Captain James T Kirk from Star Trek, but has a larger head and a speech impediment.\
  \ As he likes to joke, it has been no impediment to his rise through the ranks of\
  \ Starship Command, which has been meteoric. Captain Biff is still only twelve years\
  \ old, although such are the warps and wefts of intergalactic travel that he is\
  \ simultaneously ten thousand years old, and yet unborn, and akin to a god. Hard\
  \ to get your head round, I know, and probably too much of a challenge for \u201C\
  Sting\u201D, who is still working on those bees.\nThe USS Milquetoast Jesuit is\
  \ sponsored by L'Oreal, and is powered by light-reflecting booster technology, just\
  \ like Andi MacDowell's hair. Captain Biff is contractually bound to use various\
  \ L'Oreal hair products, but if he had his way he would smear his ginger mop with\
  \ grease from the engine room. He is that kind of captain. When danger threatens,\
  \ as it often does, he tousles his mop with one hand while punching the starship's\
  \ complicated control panel expertly with the other, all the while barking out commands\
  \ to his crew. His accent is a curious mixture of Wyoming, Luxembourg, and vampire.\
  \ He is extremely fond of Janacek's String Quartet Number One, \u201CThe Kreutzer\
  \ Sonata\u201D, and likes to have it played by the starship band at moments of high\
  \ peril. When they are otherwise engaged, for example if they have been beamed down\
  \ to a newly discovered planetoid to give an impromptu concert of Thomas Beecham\
  \ Lollipops, Captain Biff loses his rag and flies into a temper tantrum, with much\
  \ uncontrollable flapping about and twitching.\nI hope you have found these three\
  \ examples helpful. Please add your own in the Comments. And please note that as\
  \ soon as \u201CSting\u201D gets back to me about the bees, I will add his findings\
  \ here as a post scriptum.\n[2008-05-07]"
