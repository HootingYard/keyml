text: "It saddens me to report that weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has been caught red-handed\
  \ in an act of plagiarism. His verse \u201CThe Fountainhead\_: Homage \xE0 Ayn Rand\u201D\
  \ from his well-received recent collection A Series Of Homages To Female Right-Wing\
  \ Russo-American Postage Stamp Collectors was, it seems, lifted word for word from\
  \ this paragraph in Compound Words\_: A Study Of The Principles Of Compounding,\
  \ The Components Of Compounds, And The Use Of The Hyphen by Frederick W. Hamilton,\
  \ LL. D., published in 1918 by the Committee on Education of the United Typothetae\
  \ Of America:\n\u201C41. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which\
  \ should be hyphenated, and which do not fall under any of the above classifications.\n\

  \ consensus of opinion of a considerable number of good authorities from DeVinne\
  \ (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913).\u201D\nThe only change Dennis Beerpint makes\
  \ is to add an exclamation mark after \u201Cfountain-head\u201D, presumably to remind\
  \ himself to shout the word, triumphantly, at recitals.\n[2010-07-08]"
