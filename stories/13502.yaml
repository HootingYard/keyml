text: 'There may be a short interval of unearthly silence at Hooting Yard, during
  which time Mr Key is engaged in the important business of concocting, for your delight,
  a paperback book. If all goes well, this will be available from Lulu in time for
  you to purchase multiple copies as Christmas gifts for your nearest and dearest
  and for anybody else you feel compelled to present with a Christmas gift, whomsoever
  they may be. Personally, I always feel the need to give a gift to the newsagent''s
  cat. I never do, because it is a very stupid cat and would neither understand nor
  appreciate any gift I might give it, but every year I feel I ought to. Thus are
  my Christmases ruined, as I toss and turn and bite my pillow, racked with catguilt.
  Your Christmas, on the other hand, will be one of unsurpassed joy, as you clutch
  the latest Hooting Yard paperback to your bosom, weeping with gratitude.
