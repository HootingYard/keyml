  \ mock the countless websites devoted to mystic woo in all its forms. But today\
  \ I had what platitudinists would term a \u201Cwake up call\u201D. At Past Life\
  \ Analysis, you will find a simple \u201Canalysis program\u201D to answer the question\
  \ \u201CWho were you in your last life?\u201D It looks idiotic, and I do not recommend\
  \ reading the Disclaimer, but when I entered my birthdate I was flabbergasted to\
  \ get this result:\nYour past life diagnosis:\nI don't know how you feel about it,\
  \ but you were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were a fictional athlete,\
  \ a sprinter and pole-vaulter named Bobnit Tivol, and you won many tin medals under\
  \ the guidance of a cantankerous chain-smoking coach called Old Halob.\nYour brief\
  \ psychological profile in your past life: Seeker of cakes and celery pie. You could\
  \ have had great insight into ancient Etruscan soap-making techniques. Others perceived\
  \ you as a pioneering prophet of Edward De Bono's revolutionary \u201CSix Hats Thinking\
  \ System\u201D, even though you only had two hats.\nThe lesson that your last past\
  \ life brought to your present incarnation: You fulfil your lesson by taking well-earned\
  \ naps. You came to this life to learn to brim with compassionate intensity whenever\
  \ you contemplate the spindly inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage.\nDo you remember now?\n\
  To which the answer is\_: Great Heavens to Betsy, I do!\n[2007-10-17]"
