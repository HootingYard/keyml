text: "Whenever I come upon the phrase \u201Cover-egging the pudding\u201D, I want\
  \ to know precisely what sort of pudding is being talked about, with a recipe where\
  \ possible. I have been known to ask the question aloud, so keen am I to know. If\
  \ I am out and about, on a bus for example, or sitting on a municipal park bench,\
  \ my sudden cry of \u201CYes, yes, but what kind of pudding?\u201D can disconcert\
  \ those who overhear me. I have never, in these circumstances, received a satisfactory\
  \ reply to my question, but that is hardly surprising. People just don't seem to\
  \ know as much about puddings as they used to. I am not sure why that is. It could\
  \ be part of the same regrettable civilizational decline which has seen Received\
  \ Pronunciation disappear from our radio broadcasts and television programmes. You\
  \ can bet that a 1930s bus passenger or a 1950s municipal park bench occupant would\
  \ have turned to face me and said, \u201CEggy pudding, I expect, old chap\u201D\
  , clearly enunciating every last syllable.\nI give eggy pudding merely as an example.\
  \ Remember that the presence of eggs, even too many eggs, in a pudding does not\
  \ necessarily indicate that the pudding itself is an eggy one. It might be a plum\
  \ pudding, a suet pudding, or My Lady Kent's Pudding, to name but a lovely trio\
  \ of puddings. There are others.\nWhat bothers me, what has me shouting my head\
  \ off on a bus or a bench, or elsewhere, is the laziness of writers who trot out\
  \ the phrase \u201Cover-egging the pudding\u201D without thinking. I would not for\
  \ a moment dare compare myself with George Orwell, but he and I have one thing in\
  \ common, which is that we like to keep count of our eggs. Indeed, I would go further\
  \ than the author of Shooting An Elephant. I like to keep count not only of my own\
  \ eggs, but of other people's eggs, and of fictional eggs, and of metaphorical eggs.\
  \ I am Alfred Hitchcock's worst nightmare. The point is, if I am told that a pudding\
  \ has been over-egged, I want to know by how many eggs the recipe has been exceeded,\
  \ and to know that I need to know the identity of the pudding. Is that a crime?\n\
  In this day and age, it probably is. After all, there are council officials reading\
  \ this who think \u201Cegg\u201D might mean \u201Cfor example\u201D in Latin. They\
  \ might well turf me out of my bus seat or bench and take me away to a compulsory\
  \ brain-sloshing workshop, where I will learn that the counting of eggs is pernicious\
  \ and the identification of puddings is antisocial. Until that day, I shall continue\
  \ to demand an answer to my question, because I want to know about the eggs, and\
  \ the puddings, and I make no excuses for being a seeker after knowledge and enlightenment.\n\
