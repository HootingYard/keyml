  \ Miss Hathorn's splendid adaptation of A Recipe For Gruel in 2014. But what is\
  \ this I find, lurking in a remote corner of Het Internet? Why, it is a film entitled\
  \ Creekside Artists, made by Endwell Productions as long ago as 2006\u20137, the\
  \ soundtrack of which is a direct recording of Mr Key babbling away on the radio\
  \ about Dobson, Marigold Chew, squirrels, and seagulls. I had no idea this existed.\
  \ I suppose it also counts as one of my rare forays into the world of ART.\n\n[2016-09-03]"
