text: "On a cold wet afternoon in November 1965, Athol and Bruce and Judith and Keith\
  \ let it be known that the carnival was over. The cat was out of the bag. I was\
  \ but a tot at the time, with only half a dozen summers behind me, but I knew this\
  \ was a call to action. If I did not do something, where would it end?\nFirst things\
  \ first. I decided to put the cat back in the bag. It was a cloth bag, pink and\
  \ green with a scattering of yellow dots, like the dawn rising on a buttercup-splattered\
  \ meadow, with a draw-string fastener. My mother used it for keeping her buttons\
  \ in\u2014so many buttons!\u2014until I tipped them out near the fireplace. I picked\
  \ up the bag, drew it open to its full extent\u2014impressive forward-planning for\
  \ one so young!\u2014and went in search of the cat.\nI waylaid Pontius\u2014that\
  \ was the name of the cat \u2014by the wainscot in the parlour, picked him up by\
  \ the scruff of the neck, and tried to shove him back into the bag. But, like most\
  \ cats, Pomtius was not tractable, and he struggled in my grasp, flailing, and clawing\
  \ savagely at my face. Had a passing snapper photographed the scene, it would have\
  \ resembled Neon Park's cover design for the Mothers of Invention album Weasels\
  \ Ripped My Flesh, although that picture was not executed until 1970, it would have\
  \ shown a six-year-old boy rather than an adult male and a cat rather than a weasel,\
  \ and would most likely have been black-and-white rather than full colour. Most\
  \ of my memories of that time are monochrome, when I call them to mind, which is\
  \ more and more often these days.\nHowling, I dropped Pontius, who skittered off\
  \ at high speed towards the catflap and the open air. I also dropped the bag. Clutching\
  \ at my bloody cheek, I went in search of my mother and bandages.\nRestarting the\
  \ carnival would have to wait. Alackaday, I was soon distracted by other matters\u2014\
  a tumbler of milk, snakes and ladders, picking up buttons\u2014and I quite forgot\
  \ about the carnival. Only today, more than half a century later, have I remembered\
  \ that it is up to me to get it started again. I will, I will, after I have taken\
  \ a nap.\n[2019-04-28]"
