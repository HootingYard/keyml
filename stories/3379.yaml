  \ himself with Spotify. Not only that, but he has offered to share with Hooting\
  \ Yard readers some of his so-called \u201CPebblehead's Picks\u201D.\nSo here is\
  \ the first one. Those of you who are already Spotifyists can simply copy the code\
  \ below and paste it into the \u201Csearch\u201D silo hub at the upper left of the\
  \ Spotify screen:\nspotify:user:pebblehead:playlist:3SNwkyCdDlxKEPJfBHXnZY\nPebblehead\
  \ writes: \u201CI am not going to tell you in advance what this is. Just copy and\
  \ paste and hit play, and listen through to the end. Recorded and performed less\
  \ frequently than some of the composer's more popular works, it is, in my view,\
  \ twenty-five minutes of transcendent genius.\u201D\nPebblehead knows whereof he\
  \ speaks.\n[2009-11-05]"
