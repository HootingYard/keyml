text: "It escaped my attention the other day, but the piece Fatso And Slosher was\
  \ the three-thousandth potsage [sic] at Hooting Yard. Or rather, it was the three-thousandth\
  \ potsage in what I still think of as \u201Cnew format\u201D Hooting Yard, beginning\
  \ in January 2007 and replacing the old format used from 2003 to 2006. This, then,\
  \ is potsage 3003.\nJohn Ruskin liked to number the paragraphs in some of his books\u2014\
  notably the mad autobiography Praeterita\u2014and I ache, slightly, that I did not\
  \ take the decision to number the potsages here way back when. (The same can be\
  \ said of the Resonance104.4FM radio shows, of which there are now untold oodles.)\
  \ Of course, I could delve into the innards of the archive and edit each and every\
  \ potsage to give it its assigned Bl\xF6tzmann\_Number, but I do not have the patience\
  \ to do so, and the benefits would be negligible, other than to satisfy a numerical\
  \ fancy.\nQ\u2014Should numerical fancies be satisfied, all else being equal?\n\
  A\u2014There is no definitive answer to this question. On the one hand, Bl\xF6tzmann\_\
  applied numbers to absolutely everything, fanatically, even when there was only\
  \ one of them, like some of the exhibits in Sir Thomas Browne's Museum Clausum.\
  \ On the other hand, Dobson never numbered anything, allegedly because he never\
  \ learned to count. It was said of the out of print pamphleteer that \u201C[he]\
  \ did not even know how many feet he had, which is why so many spare boots were\
  \ found in his closet\u201D.\nHad I bothered to number the potsages, an exciting\
  \ activity might have been devised, let us call it Hooting Yard Sortilege. By plucking\
  \ a tile from a pippy bag containing three thousand tiny bakelite tiles numbered\
  \ from one to three thousand, the plucker would be led to a specific potsage, contemplation\
  \ of which would provide guidance to the supplicant. What I would suggest is that\
  \ those of you who wish their lives to be directed and governed by Hooting Yard\u2014\
  which I imagine is every single one of you\u2014should print a paper copy of the\
  \ entire archive, carry out snippage with scissors to separate the potsages, and\
  \ number them accordingly. Then make a pile of them and do the pippy bag / bakelite\
  \ tile business.\nWhile you lot are doing that, I shall proceed onwards towards\
  \ the four-thousandth potsage, with the wind at my heels, and a look of beatific\
  \ stupidity on my face.\n[2014-08-24]"
