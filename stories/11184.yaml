text: "\u201CKnitting And Catastrophe In The Cinema\u201D. Who could resist a talk\
  \ with such a title? Certainly not me, which is why I pranced majestically through\
  \ the south London streets in freezing temperatures yesterday evening to go and\
  \ listen to Jonathan Faiers explain all.\nUnfortunately, Dr Faiers turned out to\
  \ be an academic, so his talk\u2014which contained some interesting and intriguing\
  \ snippets\u2014was couched in dreadful brain-numbing postmodern gobbledegook. I\
  \ realise that to carve out a career in modern academia you have to talk and write\
  \ like that, but how one yearns to hear a simple, straightforward sentence! Instead,\
  \ it's all \u201Cdiscourses interrogating notions of the Other\u201D, blah blah\
  \ bollocks. I think \u201Cinterrogate\u201D, in its various forms, popped out of\
  \ Dr Faiers\u2019 mouth half a dozen times in little more than twenty minutes. I\
  \ would happily have subjected him to a proper interrogation, tied to a chair in\
  \ a secret police basement with a Klieg light shoved in his face.\nThings were not\
  \ helped by the fact that he was unable to master the technology to show us the\
  \ film clips with which he meant to illustrate his blather. These would have included\
  \ scenes from The King Of Comedy (Martin Scorsese, 1983), Breakfast At Tiffany's\
  \ (Blake Edwards, 1961), Rosemary's Baby (Roman Polanski, 1968), and Double Indemnity\
  \ (Billy Wilder, 1944). You see what I mean? It could have been very interesting\
  \ indeed.\nIn spite of all, I do applaud Dr Faiers for his title. \u201CKnitting\
  \ And Catastrophe In The Cinema\u201D deserves its place in any list of highly amusing\
  \ academic studies, alongside the one I devised thirty years ago, in tandem with\
  \ my then colleague, the journalist and television person Tracey MacLeod. We planned\
  \ to insert, in a bibliography, reference to a paper entitled \u201CTopiary And\
  \ Miscegenation In Contemporary Cinema\u201D. Alas, it never appeared, for reasons\
  \ I cannot now recall.\n[2013-03-26]"
