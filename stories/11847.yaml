text: "Kenya correspondent Bill Hatworn was one of the very greatest letter-writers\
  \ of the twentieth century. Although most of his correspondence has already been\
  \ gathered in the forthcoming Collected Letters Of Bill Hatworn, new items continue\
  \ to come to light, including this unsigned and undated example, sent to an unknown\
  \ recipient:\nMeet me at the fireworks factory. I'll be wearing red. You in your\
  \ shoes, and me at the end of my tether. Speak to me\u2014fourteen words. You can\
  \ make them up. I will listen, but I won't swim in your muddy waters. Truth, or\
  \ grit, or something foreign to my senses\u2014you had better see me right re: my\
  \ expenses. I paid through the nose and it hurt me much, but where I goes is such\
  \ and such.\n[2013-08-15]"
