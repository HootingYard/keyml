text: "This is a transcript of a handwritten piece read today on Hooting Yard On The\
  \ Air on ResonanceFM. If you do not already keep your bakelite wireless tuned in\
  \ to the station twenty four hours a day, for god's sake get a grip!\nIt occured\
  \ to me to write something on the bus on the way to the studio, to give this week's\
  \ show a really contemporary feel. I know that Hooting Yard listeners rightly expect\
  \ a programme that has its finger on the pulse of the times, that is truly up to\
  \ the minute. Well, this week it certainly is, because what I am reading to you\
  \ was written within the past hour.\nAnd I am reading it with some difficulty, actually,\
  \ because a bus journey does not lend itself to the practice of exquisite copperplate\
  \ handwriting. I am trying to make sense of what can only be described as a semi-legible\
  \ scrawl. Buses bump and clatter and shake, and at times it is akin to being a sock\
  \ or a napkin in a tumble drier.\nGod, this is dull. Let me turn to another, non-bus-related\
  \ topic.\nRecently I referred in passing to my Flemish cheesecloth suit, and as\
  \ a result I received letters from several listeners who, showing great good sense,\
  \ sought my advice on matters of style and fashion, of dash and \xE9lan. Strikingly,\
  \ no fewer than four of these letters concerned the wearing of hats at a rakish\
  \ angle.\n\u201CDear Frank,\u201D wrote one listener, somewhat over-familiarly,\
  \ given that I have no idea who he is, \u201CCan you tell me how best to calculate\
  \ the exact angle at which I should wear my hat, or titfer, to maximise its rakishness?\u201D\
  \nWell, for that correspondent, and for the others who raised this important issue,\
  \ I am preparing a small pamphlet, not yet in print, which addresses the question\
  \ with more vigour and panache than I would guess have ever been attempted since\
  \ people began wearing hats, caps, bonnets, Tam o\u2019 Shanters, berets, fezzes,\
  \ and all sorts of other headgear, which as you are probably aware was an immensely\
  \ long time ago, back in what we often call the mists of time, and certainly before\
  \ you were born. By my reckoning, it took several centuries from the first wearing\
  \ of a hat to the insight that to tilt said hat at a rakish angle lent the wearer\
  \ a certain cachet among the other members of their tribe, or what, following Hazel\
  \ Blears, we would now call their community.\nOf course, there were many false starts.\
  \ Some angles are simply not rakish, and never will be, but they were tried and\
  \ tested, often with the use of protractors and sextants and astrolabes, and we\
  \ should be grateful to those tireless but flawed hat angle experimenters, for without\
  \ their work we would doubtless still be going about our modern gleaming city streets\
  \ wearing our hats at ludicrously unrakish angles. Some people still do, of course,\
  \ including one or two of my fellow-passengers on this bus. I think it is my duty,\
  \ once my pamphlet is in print, to carry a carton of them with me where'er I roam,\
  \ handing out free copies to the insufficiently rakish.\nEnd of bus journey now.\
  \ I shall lay down my pen, and speak to you soon.\n[2008-09-18]"
