text: "In the reign of William III, there resided at Ipswich a family which, from\
  \ the number of peculiarities belonging to it, was distinguished by the name of\
  \ \u2018the Odd Family\u2019. Every event remarkably good or bad happened to this\
  \ family on an odd day of the month, and every member had something odd in his or\
  \ her person, manner, or behaviour. The very letters in their Christian names always\
  \ happened to be an odd number; the husband's name was Peter, and the wife's name\
  \ Raboh: they had seven children, all boys, viz, Solomon, Roger, James, Matthew,\
  \ Jonas, David, and Ezekiel. The husband had but one leg, his wife but one arm.\
  \ Solomon was born blind of one eye, and Roger lost his sight by accident. James\
  \ had his left ear bit off by a boy in a quarrel, and Matthew was born with only\
  \ three fingers on his right hand. Jonas had a stump foot and David was hump-backed.\
  \ All these, except the latter, were remarkably short, while Ezekiel was six foot\
  \ one inch high at the age of nineteen The stump-footed Jonas and the hump-backed\
  \ David got wives of fortune, but no girls in the borough would listen to the addresses\
  \ of their brothers. The husband's hair was as black as jet, and the wife's remarkably\
  \ white; yet every one of the children's hair was red. The husband was killed by\
  \ accidentally falling into a deep pit in the year 1701; and his wife, refusing\
  \ all kinds of sustenance, died five days after him, and they were buried in one\
  \ grave. In 1703, Ezekiel enlisted as a grenadier; and although he was afterwards\
  \ wounded in twenty-three places, he recovered. Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas, and\
  \ David, it appears by the church registers, died in different places and were buried\
  \ on the same day, in 1713; and Solomon and Ezekiel were drowned together in crossing\
  \ the Thames in the year 1723. Such a collection of odd circumstances never occurred\
  \ before in one family.\nJohn Timbs, English Eccentrics And Eccentricities, Volume\
