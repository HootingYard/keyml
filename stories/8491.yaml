text: "In the annals of light entertainment, few acts have been as universally loved\
  \ as the Screaming Abdabs. It is curious, however, that as much as they were adored,\
  \ they were completely misunderstood. Many, if not most of their fans loved them\
  \ for all the wrong reasons. The misapprehension of what they were about niggled\
  \ certain members of the troupe, though others were content enough with the popular\
  \ adulation, and the rewards it brought in its train.\nThey began as circus performers,\
  \ under the direction of Maud Abdab, usually known as Old Ma Abdab. Contemporary\
  \ reports of their first appearances suggest that the act was fully formed from\
  \ the very beginning. Old Ma and her brood of little Abdabs would stand together,\
  \ in a line, in the middle of the big top, and scream their heads off for about\
  \ a quarter of an hour. It is difficult to give the flavour of the act in plain\
  \ prose without resorting to long strings of capital letters and exclamation marks.\
  \ EEEEKKKK!!!! and AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!! will have to do, I'm afraid, though they\
  \ fail to convey the sheer volume and blood-curdling terror of the Abdabs\u2019\
  \ screaming.\nEarly audiences seem to have believed that the Screaming Abdabs were\
  \ screaming in response to the circus clowns. This may indeed be the origin of the\
  \ clich\xE9 that clowns are in some ways disturbing and frightening. They are not.\
  \ The circus clown is simply a man or woman who cuts capers and cavorts and blunders\
  \ about while wearing bright baggy apparel and caked in makeup. Only a milquetoast\
  \ would be scared of them.\nWhether their audiences were composed of milquetoasts\
  \ and milksops or not, the Screaming Abdabs were an immediate hit. They were soon\
  \ enough too big for even the biggest of big tops to contain them, and they progressed\
  \ to the music hall. From the music hall they moved on to variety theatres, and\
  \ then to radio, television, and the big screen. Throughout, the act remained in\
  \ all essentials exactly the same. As Old Ma Abdab got old and doddery, and the\
  \ little Abdabs grew to adulthood and had tinies of their own, so the troupe replenished\
  \ itself. It remained a family affair.\nIt was once they were away from the circus,\
  \ and thus away from the supposedly frightening clowns, that the various misunderstandings\
  \ about their act began to proliferate. The point to recall is that Old Ma Abdab\
  \ made very clear the nature of the Screaming Abdabs in her memoir, where she wrote:\
  \ \u201CWe are just simple folk who stand in a line and scream our heads off.\u201D\
  \ So straightforward an explanation seems not to have satisfied many of their fans,\
  \ who devised all sorts of theories to account for their mass appeal.\nThe most\
  \ notorious was probably that of the French existentialist Jean-Luc Existent, who\
  \ bashed out innumerable essays and colour supplement feature articles and even\
  \ entire books. The gist of his theory is difficult to disentangle from the thicket\
  \ of clogged and unreadable texte in which he expounded it, over and over again.\
  \ At a guess, and with a headache, I would say that he saw, or heard, in the Screaming\
  \ Abdabs something akin to \u201Coriginal man, shouting his consonants\u2026 in\
  \ yells of awe and anger at his tragic state, at his own self-awareness and at his\
  \ own helplessness before the void\u201D. The quotation is from that terrible old\
  \ fraud, the American painter Barnett Newman, himself a great devotee of the Screaming\
  \ Abdabs. There is a story that a wealthy patron commissioned Newman to paint a\
  \ group portrait of the troupe, unaware that, as the critic Robert Hughes noted,\
  \ he \u201Chad no discernible talent as a draftsman\u201D and \u201Ca reductive\
  \ cast of mind\u201D. The patron was apparently not best pleased to be presented\
  \ with a large canvas painted a single shade of red, with a vertical yellow stripe\
  \ slightly off-centre.\nThe French pseud's theory, however, led many to take a similar\
  \ view of the Screaming Abdabs, seeing their screaming as somehow representative\
  \ of something other than pure unbridled screaming. What this \u201Cother\u201D\
  \ was varied according to the particular hobbyhorse of whoever was chucking their\
  \ ha'penny's worth into the critical pot. Echoes were found of Franz Kafka, Edvard\
  \ Munch, Sylvia Plath, E M Cioran, Samuel Beckett, Rolf Harris and Harold Pinter.\
  \ It is telling, I think, that when questioned, at length, by Russell Harty, Popsy\
  \ Abdab, a second generation Screaming Abdab, insisted she had never heard of any\
  \ of these people. While we must acknowledge that the purity of their screaming\
  \ is sui generis, I must reluctantly admit that the link with Pinter may carry some\
  \ weight, if only because the late playwright was occasionally mistaken for a member\
  \ of the Screaming Abdabs, for instance when he was thinking about American presidents\
  \ or having to deal with waiters, taxi drivers, and other representatives of the\
  \ little people.\nThe twenty-first century has, alas, not been kind to the Screaming\
  \ Abdabs. Old Ma Abdab is long dead, the most committed members of the troupe are\
  \ elderly and infirm, and the younger Abdabs seem more inclined to post videos on\
  \ YouTube rather than to engage in live performance. We shall not see, nor hear,\
  \ with our hands over our ears, their like again.\n[2012-02-29]"
