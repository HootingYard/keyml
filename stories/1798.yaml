text: "Pansy Cradledew has been reading The Law And Customs Relating To Gloves, Being\
  \ An Exposition Historically Viewed Of Ancient Laws, Customs, And Uses In Respect\
  \ Of Gloves, And Of The Symbolism Of The Hand And Glove In Judicial Proceedings\
  \ by James William Norton-Kyshe (Stevens & Haynes, London 1901). Among the fascinating\
  \ material in this book, she has drawn my attention to these glove-related nuggets\
  \ of interest:\nMusonius, a philosopher who lived at the close of the first century\
  \ of Christianity, among other invectives against the corruption of the age, says\
  \ \u201Cit is shameful that persons in perfect health should clothe their hands\
  \ and feet with soft and hairy coverings\u201D. (page 4)\nAbout Queens, we read\
  \ that Anne Boleyn was marvellously dainty about her gloves. She had a nail which\
  \ turned up at the side, and it was the delight of Queen Catharine to make her play\
  \ at cards without her gloves, in order that the deformity might disgust King Henry.\
  \ It is also an historical fact that Queen Elizabeth was extravagant, fastidious,\
  \ and capricious in the extreme about her gloves, and used to display them to advantage\
  \ in playing the virginal. (page 55)\nIt was considered unbecoming if not undignified\
  \ in olden days to wear gloves when visiting the royal stables. The reason given\
  \ seems strange, but it is an ancient established custom in Germany, that whoever\
  \ enters the stables of a prince, or great man, with his gloves on his hands, is\
  \ obliged to forfeit them by a fee to the servants. (page 83)\n[2009-02-14]"
