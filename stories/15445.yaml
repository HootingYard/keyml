text: "You will be pleased to learn that Mr Key has returned from his sojourn on foreign\
  \ shores, refreshed, revivified, and ready to shower you once again with sweeping\
  \ paragraphs of majestic prose. I am not going to tell you much, if anything, about\
  \ my jaunt, but I think it is worth noting that I met, on my travels, a man called\
  \ Dave, from Australia who, when young, used to dye chickens different colours.\
  \ It was not entirely clear to me whether he did this as a form of gainful employment,\
  \ or for his own entertainment. It might even have been art. I mention this because\
  \ it occurred to me that an Antipodean chicken-dyer could prove a useful recurring\
  \ character in the various doings recounted here at Hooting Yard. We shall see.\n\
  Oh, one more thing. I was startled to discover that Dave was unable to name the\
  \ four members of The Seekers. I have long believed\u2014with good reason\u2014\
  that it is the mark of any civilised person, and certainly of any civilised Antipodean,\
  \ that they can rattle off those names without even having to think, much as one\
  \ might list John, Paul, George, and Ringo (not forgetting Yoko, of course), or\
  \ Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, or Wynken, Blynken, and Nod. I have no doubt that\
  \ every single one of my readers will be as baffled as I was by Dave's inability\
  \ in this regard. Perhaps a lethal chemical constituent of the dyes used on those\
  \ chickens long ago bedizened his brainpans.\n\n[2017-07-20]"
