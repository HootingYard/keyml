text: "This, from Ptak Science Books, is simply magnificent:\n\nM Maid Fainting\n\
  For the millions of Americans who were newly affluent in 1925 but not affluent enough\
  \ to afford a fainting maid that they could attend to came the Maid Fainting Society\
  \ Inc of America.\_ Bonded in 15 states, MFSA sponsored overseas maids to faint\
  \ in good American homes.\_ They were hired out at $4/hour (a handsome hourly sum\
  \ in 1925), the fainting maids being allowed to keep half.\_ In 1926 a sub-cult\
  \ of Extra-Tall Fainting Maids was born (an example of which is pictured above),\
  \ and provided an income to thousands for several years.\_ (One of the last silent\
  \ films ever made, Fainting Maid Maiden, with Clara Bow, 1944, used this phenomenon\
  \ as a basis for its story; by that time however the craze had passed, the war was\
  \ on, and no one cared any more for silent films about fainting maids.)\n[2010-05-01]"
