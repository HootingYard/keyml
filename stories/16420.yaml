text: "Gus was pipped at the post. It was one of those huffington posts, recently\
  \ erected at strategic points across the land, by diktat. They were named in honour\
  \ of Puissance Huffington, the tiny orphan child who, by some inexplicable chain\
  \ of accidents, now reigns over our realm. Nobody expected frail little Puissance\
  \ to rule with an iron fist, but she does, and then some!\nLike so many citizens,\
  \ Gus had assumed that Puissance would be a benign queenlet. It was perhaps this\
  \ naivete which led to his undoing, when he entered a contest in the weekly children's\
  \ comic The Terrible Wrath Of Christ Our Saviour. Readers were asked to supply a\
  \ caption for a drawing which showed an innocent farmyard scene, typical of our\
  \ country. Mischievous Gus wrote something disobliging about a hen, unaware that\
  \ every single caption submitted to the comic would be scrutinised, personally,\
  \ by Puissance Huffington. She could not read, of course, so pressed into service\
  \ a man of letters who loitered somewhere in the bowels of the palace. When this\
  \ sickly one-legged fellow read to Puissance the words written by Gus, she was outraged.\n\
  \u201CI am very fond of hens,\u201D she is reported to have said, \u201CAnd I will\
  \ not have disobliging things said of them, no siree!\u201D\nAnd she told the man\
  \ of letters to aim his crutches in the direction of the Palace Git, conveying instructions\
  \ to have Gus arrested. And so within hours of writing his unwise words, Gus found\
  \ himself chained to one of the huffington posts in one of the less salubrious parts\
  \ of the country, populated for the most part by ne'er-do-wells, halfwits, and Corbynistas.\
  \ Eagerly, they pelted Gus with pips, as Puissance Huffington decreed.\nIn retrospect,\
  \ we can appreciate just how fortunate Gus was to have committed his crime in the\
  \ early days of the reign of Puissance. For her power made the little orphan child\
  \ ever more vindictive and cruel, and it was not long before she declared that miscreants\
  \ should be pelted, not with pips, but with plumstones.\n\n[2018-03-28]"
