  \ Yard. According to The Telegraph our plucky British honeybees are at risk from\
  \ swarms of killer hornets. The fiendish Vespa velutinae have reached France, where\
  \ \u201Cthousands of football-shaped hornet nests are now dotted all over the forests\
  \ of Aquitaine\u201D. We will be setting up a Hornet Patrol soon, so drop us a line\
