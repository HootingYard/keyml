text: "This piece first appeared on Thursday 19 March 2009.\n\nDixon went to Dock\
  \ Green. It was a small patch of grass, hardly a lawn, at the edge of the dock.\
  \ The dock itself was one where huge steamers came into port from faraway lands,\
  \ carrying all sorts of exotic cargo. The cargo was mostly packed into wooden crates,\
  \ which were winched from ship to dock by dockhands. When it was lunchtime, the\
  \ dockhands sprawled on the green, the small patch of grass, and prised the lids\
  \ off their Tupperwares and unscrewed the lids from their flasks. They ate their\
  \ bloater paste sandwiches and drank their tea and while they chewed and swilled\
  \ they talked to each other about the cargo they had winched ashore that morning.\
  \ The wooden crates usually had lettering stencilled on their sides and tops describing\
  \ what the crates contained. One might read FRUIT GUMS, another GIRAFFE BRAINS.\n\
  Leaning on a fence, smoking his pipe, Dixon listened carefully to the chitchat of\
  \ the dockhands. He used to be a policeman. Now he was a spy. His mission was to\
  \ find out what cargo had been winched ashore that morning and report back to his\
  \ spymasters. His spymasters were shadowy figures who sat behind a big desk in an\
  \ unlit room in a skyscraper in town. The room was unlit so that Dixon was unable\
  \ to see them with any clarity and thus recognise them and thus be able to identify\
  \ them at a later date if ever questioned.\nDixon could have just blundered around\
  \ the dock and read the stencilled lettering on all the crates but he preferred\
  \ to listen to the chitchat of the dockhands because he could not read. He used\
  \ to be able to, when he was a policeman, but he had lost the ability. One day,\
  \ one September day to be precise, he had been chasing a miscreant and lost his\
  \ footing in a gutter and banged his head, and after banging his head he forgot\
  \ everything he had ever known, even his own name, and where he lived, and how old\
  \ he was, and what he did for a living, and how to read. In short, he was an amnesiac.\n\
  One of the spymasters came to the clinic where Dixon had been put. To disguise his\
  \ identity, the spymaster wore a mask and modified his voice with an electronic\
  \ device. He offered Dixon a job at Dock Green. This day I am telling you about\
  \ was Dixon's first day. While he was leaning against the fence smoking his pipe\
  \ and listening to the dockhands, he forgot all about the unlit room in the skyscraper\
  \ and the shadowy spymasters who had sent him on his mission. He became very interested\
  \ in the fruit gums and giraffe brains and the winching mechanism and he walked\
  \ on to the ship to take a closer look.\nDixon was still on the ship when it steamed\
  \ out of port on its way to a far distant land to collect more cargo. One day, out\
  \ in the middle of one of those big oceans that make up so much of the planet's\
  \ surface, he received a bash on the head from a violent sailor. Then Dixon remembered\
  \ everything. He remembered he was a policeman, so he tried to arrest the violent\
  \ sailor for bashing him on the head. But the law of the land holds no sway at sea,\
  \ and the ship's captain locked him up in a cabin until they made landfall.\nThe\
  \ first land they came to was a tiny rock. The captain and the violent sailor took\
  \ Dixon by the arms and legs and shoved him off the ship on to the rock. It was\
  \ almost barren, encrusted with barnacles and other shelly denizens of the sea and\
  \ rocks, but there was a small patch of grass. Dixon dubbed it Dock Green and fashioned\
  \ a flag from his cravat and found a stick for a flagpole and planted his flag in\
  \ the grass. And he devised a fishing rod and a bow and arrows and a desalination\
  \ unit, for he was a resourceful policeman, and he ruled over his little kingdom,\
  \ where there was never a whiff of crime, for many, many years.\nNOTE\_: Younger\
  \ readers, and those unfamiliar with British television of decades past, may like\
  \ to know that an inaccurate adaptation of this story was the basis for a long running\
  \ television series.\n[2014-05-28]"
