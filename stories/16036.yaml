text: "\n\u2018Twas brillig, again, but the slithy toves were nowhere to be seen.\
  \ And that wasn't all. The borogoves were anything but mimsy, and the mome raths\
  \ ingrabe. It was the most baffling case yet to have landed on the desk of Detective\
  \ Captain Cargpan at the Pointy Town Police Station & Ice Rink.\nCargpan headed\
  \ immediately to St Bibblybibdib's church for Mass. He was a Roman Catholic so devout\
  \ that he bore the stigmata, though in his case the marks were made by human rather\
  \ than divine agency. He had had them tattooed on to his hands and feet and side.\
  \ The tattooist, more accustomed to ornamenting the flesh of hairy leather-clad\
  \ rock fans, had executed Christ's wounds in the form of heavy metal umlauts. As\
  \ a result, it looked as if Cargpan was displaying double stigmata, with the inference\
  \ that he had suffered more than Christ. When accused of such blasphemy, the world-weary\
  \ detective would reply \u201CPerhaps I have, perhaps I have\u201D.\nAfter Mass,\
  \ he went to confession. The priest, Father Tonguelash, was a keen student of the\
  \ human heart, and Cargpan often relied on his insight.\n\u201CI am sore perplexed\
  \ by this brillig case, Father,\u201D he moaned.\n\u201CMoan not, my child,\u201D\
  \ said the priest, \u201CFor was it not the lately deceased psychopathic philosopher\
  \ Manson who said \u2018No sense makes sense\u2019?\u201D\nArmed with this intelligence,\
  \ and twenty Hail Marys later, Cargpan returned to his desk at the Pointy Town Police\
  \ Station & Ice Rink. He immediately set about creating a filing system, of small\
  \ rectangular pieces of cardboard shoved, alphabetically into a lockable metal cabinet.\
  \ This was to be the artificial \u201Cbrain\u201D of the brillig case.\nIn the days\
  \ following, Cargpan went to Mass several more times, smoked hundreds of cigarettes,\
  \ and sat in his parked car next to the reservoir, gazing for hours and hours at\
  \ herons and egrets and grebes and little grebes and a Jubjub. He turned over and\
  \ over in his mind, in uffish thought, the words spoken by Father Tonguelash.\n\
  Somehow he knew that, as in a Scandinavian television series, the case would end\
  \ with him apprehending a supremely clever and well-resourced serial killer, whose\
  \ base of operations would be an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, within\
  \ which was a panoply of fearsomely complicated equipment and a fiendish plan laid\
  \ out, photographs and diagrams and documents pinned up and spread over an entire\
  \ wall, rather than kept neatly in a ring binder.\nBut before he could make the\
  \ arrest, Cargpan had to identify the malefactor. Who was his manxsome foe? He sat\
  \ by the reservoir as darkness fell.\nAnd then, several impossibly blood-soaked\
  \ murders later, on a frabjous day, the perp came whiffling and burbling through\
  \ the tulgey wood. Cargpan was there to nab him. It was his Father Confessor, Ninian\
  \ Tonguelash SJ!\nIn the next season of Cargpan, Detective Captain Cargpan is on\
  \ the case of the so-called \u201CSnark\u201D, a serial killer who also turns out\
  \ to be a (spoiler alert) Jesuit priest!\n[2017-12-06]"
