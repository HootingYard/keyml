  I have always loved books as physical objects, and eschewed their digital, electronic\
  \ counterparts. But having been given a Kindle Fire tablet as a birthday gift, I\
  \ have become\u2014of necessity\u2014a convert to the e-book. I can read again,\
  \ voraciously, without having to peer like a little mole.\nThus, in the last few\
  \ months, I've been splurging, my reading life as demented and enthusiastic as ever\
  \ it was. I've reread Beckett (Molloy) and Kafka (America), Henry Fielding and Mickey\
  \ Spillane, read Theodore Dalrymple's marvellous book on litter (Litter\_: The Remains\
  \ Of Our Culture), Melanie Phillips\u2019 memoir Guardian Angel, Francis Iles, Derek\
  \ Raymond, and James Hadley Chase, H P Lovecaft, William Hazlitt, and Sir Thomas\
  \ Browne, and am currently bingeing on Georges Simenon. What a wonder he is.\n[2019-04-24]"
