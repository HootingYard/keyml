  \ sun, and its pitiless battering heat. Proper Hooting Yard weather is an overcast\
  \ sky with a hint of drizzle. It may well be that this current mini-heatwave is\
  \ what has caused the lack of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose at your favourite\
  \ website. I am listless and enervated, possibly even neurasthenic.\nAnyway, at\
  \ times like this, I find it can be useful to spur myself back into action by reading\
  \ the titanic prose of past masters. Here is Thomas Nashe, from his final\u2014\
  and fabulous\u2014work, Nashe's Lenten Stuff (1599):\nThat good old blind bibber\
  \ of Helicon, I wot well, came a-begging to one of the chief cities of Greece, &\
  \ promised them vast corpulent volumes of immortality if they would bestow upon\
  \ him but a slender out-brother's annuity of mutton & broth, and a pallet to sleep\
  \ on, and with derision they rejected him, whereupon he went to their enemies with\
  \ the like proffer, who used him honourably, and whom he used so honourably that\
  \ to this day, though it be three thousand year since, their name and glory flourish\
  \ green in men's memory through his industry. I trust you make no question that\
  \ those dull-pated pennyfathers, that in such dudgeon scorn rejected him, drunk\
  \ deep of the sour cup of repentance for it when the high flight of his lines in\
  \ common bruit was oyezed. Yea, in the word of one no more wealthy than he was (wealthy,\
  \ said I? nay, I'll be sworn he was a grand-juryman in respect of me) those greybeard\
  \ huddle-duddles and crusty cumtwangs were struck with such stinging remorse of\
  \ their miserable Euclionism and snudgery, that he was not yet cold in his grave\
  \ but they challenged him to be born amongst them, and they and six cities more\
  \ entered a sharp war about it, every one of them laying claim to him as their own\n\
