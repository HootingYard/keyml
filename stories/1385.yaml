  \ this quotation from The Daily Telegraph Book Of Obituaries. It still makes me\
  \ laugh.\nSir Atholl Oakley (1900\u20131987) was a champion wrestler, an impresario\
  \ of giants, organiser of \u201Crugged holiday cruises\u201D and an authority on\
  \ Lorna Doone. His wrestling career began after he was beaten up by a gang of thugs.\
  \ He built up his physique by drinking eleven pints of milk every day, a regimen\
  \ designed by the giant wrestler Hackenschmitt, who later told Oakley that the quantity\
  \ of milk prescribed was \u201Ca misprint\u201D.\n[2009-01-10]"
