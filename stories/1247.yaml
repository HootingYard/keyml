text: "Old Farmer Frack usually cut his own hair, hacking at it with a pair of shears,\
  \ but one day he left his cows in the care of a hired urchin and strode to the nearest\
  \ village to seek out a barber. There was no barber in the village, so Old Farmer\
  \ Frack carried on along the lane until he came to another village. Here he found,\
  \ not a barber, but a hairdresser. Unlike many hairdressing establishments, which\
  \ are fond of punning names such as Hair Apparent or A Cut Above and so on and so\
  \ forth, this one was called simply Rudimentary Hairdressing For Peasants, which\
  \ suited Old Farmer Frack down to the ground.\nHe crashed in through the door, threw\
  \ himself into a chair, and as the mildly startled hairdresser tucked a sheet around\
  \ him, he bellowed that he wanted a \u201Cchop suey\u201D.\nThe hairdresser had\
  \ no idea what this mad old farmer was talking about and tried to explain that the\
  \ only haircut available was a rudimentary one suitable for a peasant.\nOld Farmer\
  \ Frack shouted that as far as he was concerned, a \u201Cchop suey\u201D was a basic\
  \ haircut, and commanded the hairdresser to get on with it.\nHairdressers are not\
  \ cows, however, and are much less tractable. This particular hairdresser took much\
  \ pride in her work, and was not about to embark upon a haircut the lineaments of\
  \ which she was ignorant. So she asked Old Farmer Frack to describe the \u201Cchop\
  \ suey\u201D. As farmers go, Old Farmer Frack was a highly intelligent man with\
  \ an acute visual sense and a more than serviceable vocabulary, but he was also\
  \ mad, so in reply to the hairdresser he blathered a scarcely intelligible farrago\
  \ of nonsense. So persuasive was his tone of voice, however, that the hairdresser\
  \ was spellbound and convinced that she actually had some understanding of what\
  \ he was saying. No sooner had he shut his trap than she hacked at his hair with\
  \ a pair of pruning shears, for all the world as if she had been practising the\
  \ \u201Cchop suey\u201D for years.\nOld Farmer Frack was well pleased with the result,\
  \ gave the hairdresser a generous tip in addition to the cost of the haircut, crashed\
  \ out through the door and wended his way jauntily back to his cows.\nSeveral days\
  \ later, stories appeared in the local newspapers reporting that \u201Can apparition\
  \ of the late novelist Anthony Burgess has been seen stalking the lanes of our bailiwick\u201D\
  .\nFor the awful truth was that Old Farmer Frack's \u201Cchop suey\u201D could easily\
  \ be mistaken for the preposterous Mancunian polymath's haircut, memorably described\
  \ by his biographer Roger Lewis as follows: And how are we going to describe his\
  \ hair? The yellowish-white powdery strands were coiled on his scalp like Bram Stoker's\
  \ Dracula's peruke, not maintained since Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off the\
  \ Turks in the Carpathian mountains in 1462. What does it say about a man that he\
  \ could go around like that, as Burgess did? Though he was a king of the comb-over\
  \ (did the clumps and fronds emanate from his ear-hole?), no professional barber\
  \ can be blamed for this. I thought to myself, he has no idea how strange he is.\
  \ What did he think he looked like? He evidently operated on his own head with a\
  \ pair of garden shears.\n[2008-12-29]"
