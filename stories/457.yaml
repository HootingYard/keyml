text: "\u201CFrance still produces abominable sulphurous State-made matches (the manufacture\
  \ of matches being a State monopoly). The label designs are sometimes poor and the\
  \ colouring crude\u2026 One of the earliest German labels, issued in 1835, illustrates,\
  \ by drawing, how to ignite the match by rubbing it on the box. Even the most ignorant\
  \ person knew how to light a match, and the label appears a very futile one.\u201D\
