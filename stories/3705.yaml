text: "\u201COdd names crop up in all Roussel's texts, and we know he had extreme\
  \ difficulty in arriving at each final choice. Leiris records that he sometimes\
  \ asked Eug\xE8ne Vall\xE9e, the overseer at the Lemerre printing house, to fill\
  \ in the blanks or initials he had left in the manuscript, but then invariably replaced\
  \ Vall\xE9e's suggestions with other names. La Seine contains an especially eccentric\
  \ range: Ernest Arson, Buss, Bopp, Burc, Bals, Roolf, Pauline Bux, Orry, Raga, Saerck,\
  \ \xC8che, Ren\xE9e Wunster, Lay\u2026 The manuscripts offer no indication as to\
  \ how he arrived at these names.\u201D\nFootnote in Raymond Roussel And The Republic\
