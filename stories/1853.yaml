text: 'Plump, crumpled, costive gumshoe Smedley Blavelpang was in a proper fix. It
  was the sort of fix private detectives tend to find themselves in. The wind had
  blown his hat clean away and his gun was jammed and he was trapped behind some bins
  in an alleyway and the rough tough thug he had been pursuing was closing in on him
  armed with an unjammed gun full of bullets. It looked like curtains for Blavelpang.

  He could hear distant sirens, but the cops would be speeding to a different crime
  in a different part of the picture-postcard country village where Blavelpang plied
  his lonely trade, a trade which often filled him with disgust at the iniquities
  of his fellow villagers. Sometimes he was actually physically sick.

  Ping! A bullet zipped past the bins and struck a piece of municipal statuary which
  had been uprooted from its spot outside the butcher''s shop and dumped in the alleyway.
  It was a steel and lead representation of Laika, the pioneering Soviet space dog.
  The statue was unpopular with the villagers, most of whom loathed the Soviet Union
  and canine life-forms and space travel in equal measure, probably because of the
  curriculum taught in the village community education hub. From infancy they were
  brainwashed by the fierce pedagogue who ran the place with, it was said, an iron
  fist in an even more iron glove. This man was as plump and crumpled and costive
  as our imperilled detective, a resemblance not accidental, for he was Blavelpang''s
  papa.

  The relationship between the two was fraught. The papa had always opposed Smedley''s
  decision to set himself up as a private eye, wanting him instead to join an anti-Soviet
  dog-strangling spacerocket-sabotaging pressure group. But the son followed his own
  lights, and now they had brought him to this dingy alleyway where he was likely
  to perish in a hail of bullets fired by the unjammed gun-toting rough tough thug.

  Is it really curtains for Smedley Blavelpang, or will he escape an undignified death
  behind some bins? Will this crisis force him to reconsider his life-choices and
  to conclude that his papa had been right all along? Will the thug''s gun suddenly
  jam too? Find out in the next episode of our exciting serial story!
