text: "The penultimate essay in Sabine Baring-Gould's 1869 collection Curiosities\
  \ Of Olden Times is entitled \u201CSortes Sacrae\u201D, wherein we find this:\n\u201C\
  It is not an uncommon case, now-a-days, for pious persons at times of great perplexity,\
  \ to seek a solution to their difficulties in their Bibles, opening the book at\
  \ random and taking the first passage which occurs as a direct message to them from\
  \ the Almighty\u2026\n\u201CThe 11th chapter of Proverbs, which contains thirty-one\
  \ verses, is often taken to give omen of the character of a life. The manner of\
  \ consulting it is simple; it is but to look for the verse answering to the day\
  \ of the month on which the questioner was born. The answer will be found in most\
  \ cases to be exceedingly ambiguous.\u201D\nElsewhere in the essay, Baring-Gould\
  \ suggests that such augury from the Bible is by no means reliable, but I know better,\
  \ and it was with trembling hands that I turned to Proverbs, Chapter 11, in the\
  \ King James Version of course, and read verse 29:\n\u201CHe that troubleth his\
  \ own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of\
  \ heart.\u201D\nThis, then, is the infallible omen of my life. Henceforth I shall\
  \ conduct all my affairs, sacred and profane, in accordance with these words. I\
  \ suggest all Hooting Yard readers do likewise, yea, unto the Last Trump. If you\
  \ are not sure how to follow the guidance as revealed unto you in Proverbs, several\
  \ years spent as an anchorite in a sea-bashed cave will sort you out good and proper.\n\
