text: "Those of us old enough to recall the days when the Osmonds were titans of pop\
  \ have probably blocked from our memories most of the mawkish drivel with which\
  \ they assaulted the charts. One song, however, remains indelibly lodged in our\
  \ brains. I speak of course of \u201CCrazy Horses\u201D, an unhinged classic unlike\
  \ anything else they ever recorded. The circumstances of its composition make for\
  \ an intriguing story, the details of which I have been able to exhume through a\
  \ process which I am afraid I really should not tell you about.\nIt is New Year's\
  \ Day 1972. In the White House, President Nixon is having breakfast with the First\
  \ Lady, the saintly Pat. In New York, the ex-Nazi officer Kurt Waldheim is preparing\
  \ to take the reins of the United Nations, succeeding U Thant as the new Secretary\
  \ General. Also in New York, a gang of half a dozen ne'er-do-wells is making final\
  \ preparations for the Pierre Hotel Heist, which will net them approximately four\
  \ million dollars from the hotel's safety deposit boxes. Across the Atlantic Ocean,\
  \ in Paris, the capital city of France, the entertainer Maurice Chevalier is facing\
  \ his last hours. He will not see the morrow.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Osmond family\
  \ homestead, the Osmond family is gathered around in a conclave. Pa and Ma Osmond\
  \ are sitting at either end of the table. On one side sit Alan, 22, Wayne, 20, and\
  \ Merrill, 18. Facing them on the other side are Jay, 16, Donny, 14, and Marie,\
  \ 12. The runt of the litter, Little Jimmy, 8, is squashed in at a corner between\
  \ Marie and Ma Osmond. All the males are wearing their Mormon underpants, as you\
  \ would expect. Pa Osmond has just finished reciting aloud a sensible and inspiring\
  \ passage from The Book Of Mormon. The mood around the table is equally sensible\
  \ and inspiring, yet also solemn.\n\u201CWell titans of pop,\u201D says Pa Osmond,\
  \ \u201CWhat are your plans for today?\u201D\nAlan pipes up.\n\u201CWell sir, I\
  \ was thinking it would be fun if I took Wayne and Merrill and Jay and Donny and\
  \ Marie and Little Jimmy over to the paddock.\u201D\n\u201CWhat is this paddock\
  \ of which you speak, son?\u201D asks Pa.\n\u201CWell sir, I have heard tell that\
  \ over beyond the salt flats past the temple there is a paddock. It might be fun\
  \ for us to go and investigate, to see what the paddockist keeps in his paddock.\u201D\
  \nPa Osmond rubs his chin thoughtfully.\n\u201CThis paddockist, who is he?\u201D\
  \n\u201CThat I don't rightly know, sir,\u201D says Alan, blushing slightly, \u201C\
  But perhaps while Wayne and Merrill and Jay and I look into the paddock, Donny and\
  \ Marie and Little Jimmy can question the paddockist as to his bona fides.\u201D\
  \nAt this, Ma Osmond interjects.\n\u201CI would have thought it more appropriate\
  \ that you older boys interrogate the paddockist and let the younger ones frolic\
  \ in the paddock.\u201D\n\u201CIf you say so, Ma,\u201D says Alan.\nPa Osmond thumps\
  \ his fist on the table.\n\u201CNo,\u201D he says, like the forceful patriarch he\
  \ is, \u201CYou should all interrogate the paddockist together, each firing at him\
  \ one judicious question chosen to winkle out of him his bona fides. Then you can\
  \ all go to the paddock together, to see what is in there.\u201D\n\u201CYes sir!\u201D\
  \ says Alan.\nBut Ma Osmond throws a spanner in the works.\n\u201CI like the plan\
  \ as far as it goes,\u201D she says, \u201CBut what if, upon their arrival, Alan\
  \ and Wayne and Merrill and Jay and Donny and Marie and Little Jimmy find that the\
  \ paddockist is already in the paddock? Then they will not be able to separate out\
  \ the questioning from the seeing. And I would aver that he is very likely to be\
  \ in the paddock. If I had a paddock out beyond the salt flats past the temple,\
  \ that's where I would be, and no mistake.\u201D\n\u201CGood point, Ma,\u201D says\
  \ Pa Osmond, \u201CThis is something of a pickle.\u201D\n\u201CI have an idea,\u201D\
  \ says Alan, his brow furrowing as he thinks, \u201CWhat if\u2026 what if we lured\
  \ the paddockist out of the paddock? Then we could fire our questions at him, establish\
  \ his bona fides, and, having done so, we could enter the paddock to see what he\
  \ keeps in it.\u201D\nMa and Pa Osmond look at each other from either end of the\
  \ table. Long years of Mormon marriage mean they are able to communicate without\
  \ speaking. Gazing into each other's eyes, they agree that Alan's suggestion is\
  \ flawless.\n\u201COff you go then,\u201D says Pa, \u201CAnd we shall gather in\
  \ conclave around this table upon your return, so you can tell Ma and I who the\
  \ paddockist is and what is in his paddock.\u201D\nLater that evening, the Osmonds\
  \ regather just as Pa decreed. This time Little Jimmy sits scrunched in a corner\
  \ between Pa and Jay. All the males are still wearing their Mormon underpants, as\
  \ you would expect.\n\u201CTell me first of the paddockist's bona fides,\u201D says\
  \ Pa.\n\u201CWell sir,\u201D says Alan, \u201COn our way to the paddock out beyond\
  \ the salt flats past the temple we devised the questions we would ask the paddockist.\
  \ Shall we run through them, each asking his, or in Marie's case, her, question?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI think that would be a fine idea,\u201D says Pa. Ma nods her assent too.\n\
  \u201COK, me first then,\u201D says Alan, \u201CHello there, paddockist, what is\
  \ your name?\u201D\n\u201CAre you a Mormon?\u201D says Wayne.\n\u201CAre you aware\
  \ we are titans of pop?\u201D says Merrill.\n\u201CAre you now or have you ever\
  \ been a member of the Communist Party?\u201D says Jay.\n\u201CWhat brings you to\
  \ these parts, stranger?\u201D says Donny.\n\u201CAre you mad and bad and dangerous\
  \ to know?\u201D says Marie.\n\u201CWhat is that unholy and terrifying whinnying\
  \ and snorting we can hear from within the paddock?\u201D says Little Jimmy.\n\u201C\
  A well-chosen set of questions designed to elicit replies sure to establish his\
  \ bona fides,\u201D says Pa Osmond, \u201CWhat were those replies?\u201D\n\u201C\
  We could not hear them sir,\u201D says Alan, \u201CFor he was a soft-spoken paddockist\
  \ and was drowned out by the unholy and terrifying whinnying and snorting we could\
  \ hear from within the paddock.\u201D\n\u201CAnd did you enter the paddock to find\
  \ out what it was that was making such a deafening din\u201D asks Ma Osmond.\n\u201C\
  No, Ma,\u201D says Alan, \u201CWe ran away as fast as our feet could carry us.\u201D\
  \n\u201CAll well and good,\u201D says Pa, \u201CWell, that's New Year's Day over\
  \ and done with. It is bedtime. Don't forget to include President Nixon and the\
  \ saintly Pat in your prayers.\u201D\nAnd the Osmonds troop upstairs one by one\
  \ to bed. And in the night, while Ma and Pa sleep soundly, Alan and Wayne and Merrill\
  \ and Jay and Donny and Marie and Little Jimmy toss and turn in the grip of terrible\
  \ dreams, dreams that will surely do cataclysmic and irreparable damage to their\
  \ fragile young psyches . . . unless, when they wake the next morning, they can\
  \ parlay those terrors into a pop song.\n[2012-07-21]"
