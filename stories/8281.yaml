text: "Every now and then, civilisations collapse. Usually this happens after a gradual\
  \ decline due to an immensely complicated set of factors which future historians\
  \ seek to understand and explain. Sometimes, the collapse is sudden, as when barbarian\
  \ hordes come sweeping o'er the plains on horseback, bringing ruin and desolation\
  \ in their wake. Barbarians have their part to play in gradual collapses too, just\
  \ not so dramatically.\nIn understanding why civilisations collapse, then, it would\
  \ be a great boon to historians were they able to sit down on a sofa with a barbarian\
  \ and have a chinwag. What were you thinking, as you swept across the plains on\
  \ horseback, accompanied by your horde?, the historian might ask. Was it your settled\
  \ intention to cause the collapse of any civilisation you happened upon, or was\
  \ its destruction an unforeseen consequence of your penchant for havoc and mayhem?\
  \ Were you pernickety in your choice of civilisations to sweep towards, or was it\
  \ a more haphazard process? Give me some insight into pillage. And so on.\nThe benefits\
  \ of such direct evidence from the mouths of barbarians have not been forthcoming,\
  \ partly because the barbarians involved are long dead, each and every man jack\
  \ of them, and partly because, being barbarians, they are, or were, incapable of\
  \ coherent speech. Barbarians, remember, merely grunt.\nTwo recent developments,\
  \ in different fields, promise to pull the rug from under this dispiriting state\
  \ of affairs. Actually, I am not sure \u201Cto pull the rug\u201D is the appropriate\
  \ metaphor, but ipsum dipsum, let it stand. First, separate investigations into\
  \ the reanimation of the dead, mediumistic communication with the ethereal realm,\
  \ shamanism, and s\xE9ance etiquette have coalesced to the point where it may well\
  \ be feasible to plop a long dead barbarian on to a sofa and actually engage him\
  \ in conversation. However exciting this prospect is\u2014and make no mistake, it\
  \ is!\u2014it is made somewhat less so by the fact that any such conversation is\
  \ likely to be one-sided, consisting on the one hand of searching, piercing questions\
  \ delivered in a series of well-turned phrases in a plummy baritone, and on the\
  \ other hand, of barbaric grunting.\nThat is why the second recent development may\
  \ prove so decisive. Boffins in Switzerland (where else?) are putting the finishing\
  \ touches to some kind of contraption that, fitted to the head of a grunting person\u2014\
  whether he be a barbarian or not\u2014and with wires and nozzles poking, variously,\
  \ into the mouth and the brain and certain glands, is able to \u201Ctranslate\u201D\
  \ the grunts into any of a dozen or so modern languages. I placed inverted commas\
  \ around the word \u201Ctranslate\u201D because it is not yet clear if the resulting\
  \ print-outs, created with biro-nib on a gelatine wafer attached to a docking hub\u2014\
  are, strictly speaking, what we would understand as translations of grunts in the\
  \ commonly accepted sense. But billions of Swiss currency units are being poured\
  \ into this research, so I expect it will come good in the end.\nThe implications\
  \ dizzy the mind. We will have, at first hand, the accounts of individual barbarians\
  \ as they describe the process of congregating in a horde, supplying themselves\
  \ with arms and victuals, mounting their horses, and sweeping o'er the plains to\
  \ loot and pillage and lay waste to sundry isolated villages on their implacable\
  \ way towards a more advanced civilisation, the collapse of which they will then\
  \ bring about, either deliberately or inadvertently. For the first time we will\
  \ be able to apprehend a grunting enhorsed barbarian raining death and terror where'er\
  \ he roams as a person, a person like you or me, subject to the same whims and pangs,\
  \ jumping through the same hoops, balancing upon the same ledge over the awful existential\
  \ abyss. The only difference between us is that we are quick and alive, breathing\
  \ in the air of the twenty-first century, and he is barbaric and dead and can but\
  \ grunt. But such fripperies ought not divide us. Already, even before the reanimation\
  \ of the dead, and improved mediumistic communication with the ethereal realm, shamanism,\
  \ and s\xE9ance etiquette, and the final tweakings to the contraption with poking\
  \ wires and nozzles and biro-nib and gelatine wafer and docking hub, human rights\
  \ lawyers and Guardian columnists and Occupy protesters are suggesting that it is\
  \ due time barbarians were allowed to play a full part in society, given the vote,\
  \ and a living wage, and, most importantly, legally protected from being offended\
  \ by the so-called civilised.\nFar too many people dismiss a dead grunting barbarian\
  \ on a sofa as a \u201Czombie\u201D, or similar pejorative description. However,\
  \ those who show such disrespect may temper their views when techniques for the\
  \ reanimation of the dead are perfected. For then, just one barbarian, reanimated\
  \ for the purpose of an historical chinwag, might seize control of the machinery\
  \ and bring back to life his entire horde. Then, in their inimitable barbaric fashion,\
  \ they will exact their own revenge.\n[2012-02-02]"
