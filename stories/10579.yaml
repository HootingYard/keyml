text: "\nIn choosing Justin Welby as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, the Church\
  \ of England has made a grievous mistake. Mea culpa. I blame myself. I ought to\
  \ have made it clear that I was available to take up the post. I don't doubt that\
  \ the appointments commission worked on the assumption that Hooting Yard kept me\
  \ far too busy. Thus by hiding my light under a bushel, I kept myself out of the\
  \ running. Welby it is, rather than Mr Key.\nSome readers may be under the impression\
  \ that I was, in any case, not qualified to take command of the see of Canterbury.\
  \ It is true that I am not now, nor ever have been, a member of the Anglican church.\
  \ Nor have I taken holy orders and served as a priest or vicar in any Christian\
  \ denomination. Nor am I a regular churchgoer. But I would argue that these objections\
  \ are mere fiddle-faddle. I was clearly the best candidate for the job. My fatal\
  \ error was not to make clear that I actually was a candidate. In the circumstances,\
  \ they can be forgiven for overlooking me. I shall not send thunderbolts crashing\
  \ about their ears in vengeance. Not just yet, anyway.\nThe raining of righteous,\
  \ holy thunderbolts upon the heads of the people would have been one of my chief\
  \ activities as archbishop. I think I am correct in saying that appointment to the\
  \ post confers upon the incumbent the ability to do so. That most, if not indeed\
  \ all, recent archbishops have refrained from casting thunderbolts is a matter of\
  \ sore regret. It is one of the reasons the Church of England is considered wishy-washy.\
  \ Well, that would not have been a term anybody would have dared use had I been\
  \ installed at Lambeth Palace!\nAfter donning the pointy mitre and golden robes,\
  \ my first act would have been to declaim my sermon on the plains of Gath. I would\
  \ have had the congregation kneeling and trembling and terror-struck, which in my\
  \ view is the only proper response. There would be none of that queasy smiling and\
  \ shaking of hands and hugging. No pap from me about \u201Cgentle Jesus\u201D. No,\
  \ it would be fire and brimstone, fear and penitence. All the so-called \u201Cissues\u201D\
  \ which get the present church entangled in endless hand-wringing blather\u2014\
  women bishops, gay vicars, blah blah\u2014would be forgotten, because the Anglican\
  \ communion, worldwide, would be marching to a different drum, a drum pounded, relentlessly\
  \ and violently, by Mr Key. I would call on sinners to repent, and if there was\
  \ the merest whiff of shilly-shallying, I would boom that stuff about the plains\
  \ of Gath into their ears, over and over again, until they damned well did repent.\
  \ With knobs on.\nObviously, once a week I would take time off from my episcopal\
  \ duties to pop into the Resonance studios to broadcast Hooting Yard On The Air.\
  \ The staff would just have to get used to bowing their heads at my approach, no,\
  \ not just bowing, prostrating themselves on their bellies upon my arrival, in fear\
  \ and trembling. I would wave my sceptre threateningly, and cast holy thunderbolts\
  \ crashing about the studio. I think we are going to have to wait a long time for\
  \ Justin Welby to do likewise. I hear he has never even appeared on Resonance. And\
  \ now he is the Archbishop of Canterbury! No wonder this country is going to hell\
  \ in a handcart.\nUnder my rule\u2014sadly now but a figment\u2014all those handcarts\
  \ would have been turned about and heading for heaven. The heaven in question would\
  \ be a peculiarly Hooting Yard kind of heaven. I would sit there, enthroned, casting\
  \ thunderbolts and sending forth bolts of lightning from my fingertips. Serried\
  \ ranks of seraphim and cherubim and ophanim and dominions and virtues and powers\
  \ and principalities and archangels and angels would surround me, chanting ethereal\
  \ chants, strumming on harps, and engaging in a variety of other angelic activities.\
  \ Meanwhile, the great mass of Anglicans, plus of course all those poor benighted\
  \ peoples across the earth of other faiths and none, would be gathered together\
  \ poring over the collected works of Dobson, miraculously back in print!, pointing\
  \ out flocks of birds in the sky, and picnicking upon sausages and smokers\u2019\
  \ poptarts and cans of special heavenly Squelcho!.\nUnrepentant sinners, meanwhile,\
  \ those who remained impervious to the power of my booming sermon on the plains\
  \ of Gath, would be consigned to the fiery pit. It is a pit too awful to contemplate,\
  \ fiery and sulphurous and pitch black, a pit surrounded by vast walls of iron and\
  \ lead, so thick, so high, that the signal from the Resonance radio mast cannot\
  \ pierce them. Next time you are tempted to sin, think of that. Think of an eternity\
  \ of spiritual agony where you are condemned to a pit where you can never ever hope\
  \ to listen to Hooting Yard On The Air, or indeed to any of the many enticing programmes\
  \ on Resonance. You will tread the path of righteousness, will you not?, to avoid\
  \ such a terrible fate.\nStill, I would not wish it to be thought that I am munching\
  \ sour grapes. I am even minded to wish Justin Welby well. And, as I say, I have\
  \ only myself to blame. As soon as beardy Rowan Williams announced he was stepping\
  \ down, I ought to have presented myself at Lambeth Palace, engarbed in golden robes\
  \ and a pointy mitre, and simply taken over. I could have locked the beardy one\
  \ in a janitor's cupboard and proclaimed that I was now in charge. It was an opportunity\
  \ missed, and one I shall regret for the rest of my life. But I will not regret\
  \ it as much as the Anglican communion. Those teeming millions of worshippers have\
  \ no idea what they're missing.\nPerhaps I should return instead to the faith of\
  \ my fathers. The Pope is an aged fellow, and he will have to be replaced sooner\
  \ or later. I should make myself ready to assume command of the Roman Catholic church\
  \ instead. Watch this space.\n[2012-11-10]"
