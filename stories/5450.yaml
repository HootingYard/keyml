  \ that big tough persons, wrestlers and dockside brawlers and such, have been known\
  \ to quake in their boots when reading it. When it originally appeared, some years\
  \ ago, it was voted the \u201Ctale most likely to disarm a ruffian bent on brutality\u201D\
  \ by the Association For The Disarming Of Brutes And Ruffians By Means Of Prose\
  \ And Verse (Registered Charity No. 2). This is a very worthy organisation which\
  \ Hooting Yard is pleased to promote. A percentage of the money we receive in donations\
  \ is diverted from the Fund For Distressed Out Of Print Pamphleteers to help the\
  \ Association continue its work, which, weirdly, is both valuable and invaluable.\
