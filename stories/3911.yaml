text: "There are certain impenetrable mysteries which tug at our imaginations and\
  \ allow us no peace of mind. I am sure I am not the only person to be kept awake\
  \ at night, tossing and turning, chewing the pillow, my brain fuming as I ponder\
  \ in perplexity for the umpteenth time whether, for example, Badge Man was a living,\
  \ breathing, armed maniac or merely a trick of the light, whether the Loch Ness\
  \ Monster truly exists or is just a figment in the minds of socially inept men in\
  \ anoraks who like to spend their time sitting in the lochside drizzle with Thermos\
  \ flask and binoculars, whether it is permissible simply to wipe over one's socks\
  \ when performing wudhu. These are all terrifically mysterious matters, and there\
  \ are many more, so many more it is a wonder we are not stunned into mental collapse.\n\
  Every now and then, we stumble upon some fragmentary clue which promises to shed\
  \ light where previously there has been only darkness, ignorance, and numbing stupidity.\
  \ One of the greatest puzzles gnawing away inside my head has long been to find\
  \ an answer to the question: what did Tiny Enid do, once she had grown up and was\
  \ no longer tiny? Though I am still unable to give a full account of her adult doings,\
  \ I can, today, say one thing with a modicum of confidence\u2014she dressed up as\
  \ a bat.\n\nThere remains some doubt whether this really is Tiny Enid. It may be\
  \ an impostor, or even a hallucination brought on by a surfeit of lampreys. I am\
  \ clutching at straws, dammit, but sometimes that is all we can do.\n[2010-02-15]"
