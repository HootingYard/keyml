  \ a sentiment which I wholeheartedly endorse.\n\nNOTE\_: The title of this postage\

  \ film of the same name\u2014\_though I am reminded that it contains antisemitic\
  \ Roman Catholic drunkard Melvin Gibson's finest screen moment. His family is terrified\
  \ at the prospect that the appearance of crop circles could be a harbinger for the\
  \ arrival of woefully unconvincing green scaly alien beings, so Mr Gibson says:\
  \ \u201CEverybody needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something\u201D. This\
