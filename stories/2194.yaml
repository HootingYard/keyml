text: "With my fife and my drum I wandered in the hills. I tooted my fife and I banged\
  \ my drum. This was why I was wandering in the hills, for I had been banished from\
  \ town. My tooting and banging unnerved the good burghers, and the bad burghers\
  \ too, and I was escorted to the town perimeter and shoved across the line. It was\
  \ an actual line, painted in whitewash, and regularly repainted wherever it lost\
  \ integrity through scuffing by bootsoles and the like. I was told plainly, by way\
  \ of an edict, that I could never again toot my fife or bang my drum within the\
  \ town, due to the unnervement I caused. I accepted this, and wandered up into the\
  \ hills.\nToot toot toot! Bang bang bang! Toot toot bang bang toot! Bang! I was\
  \ as happy as a sandboy, although I am not entirely sure what a sandboy is, unless\
  \ it be a remarkably happy boy made out of wet impacted sand by some beach-bound\
  \ Geppetto.\nI was happy in the hills until I was attacked by a flock of putti.\
  \ No one had ever thought to tell me that the sky above the hills was infested by\
  \ chubby curly-locked cherubs from the Italian Renaissance, some armed with bows\
  \ and arrows, and all blessed with the power of flight. Whenever I had seen pictures\
  \ of them, during my lessons, I understood them to be harmless. Mischievous, yes,\
  \ but in a playful way. It came as a shock to me to discover that they were demented\
  \ and malevolent, never a good combination. They also seemed to object to my tooting\
  \ on my fife and my banging on my drum. I took shelter in a recently-vacated bivouac.\n\
  You should always take care, in the hills, when occupying a vacant bivouac, to find\
  \ out if it has been wholly abandoned or if the person who built it is due back\
  \ shortly. That person might be large and menacing with hairy fists and wild eyes.\
  \ Many hill dwellers fit that description. I saw dying embers from a fire, and some\
  \ spat-out gristle from a sausage, neither of which told me whether or not I could\
  \ expect company. The putti continued to swoop in the sky above, ready to renew\
  \ their attack if they got the chance. I judged that, if a large hairy hill-person\
  \ were to return to claim his bivouac, I could frighten him off with tooting and\
  \ banging. Such ogres are usually averse to a din. But unless the putti flew away,\
  \ I was trapped. I could only hope their attentions might be distracted by a passing\
  \ goat or peasant. I wanted to wander, yet here I was stuck in a bivouac. To pass\
  \ the time, I tooted my fife and banged my drum.\nAbout an hour later, the maker\
  \ of the bivouac returned. It was not, as I had surmised, a large and ungainly hill-person,\
  \ but grumpy German film director Horst Gack. The putti swooped upon him as he approached,\
  \ the armed ones firing golden arrows at him, but he simply shouted at them and\
  \ waved his fist, as hairy as a hill-person's fist, and they dispersed, with babyish\
  \ squeaks. I wondered why I had not thought to use Gack's simple tactics. But then,\
  \ the presiding genius of the Cinema of Belligerence had a guttural shout and an\
  \ aggressive fist-brandishment beyond compare.\nHe was unconcerned that I was occupying\
  \ his bivouac. Indeed, as soon as he saw my fife and my drum he questioned me closely\
  \ about them. He was a very intense man, as you might expect. As he fried sausages\
  \ over the rekindled fire, he told me that a fife and drum soundtrack would suit\
  \ the film he was working on, here in this bivouac, a seven-hour black-and-white\
  \ documentary about hillside goats and ogres. He explained that he had just been\
  \ out and about shooting raw footage of a goat-versus-ogre wrestling bout. I did\
  \ some tooting and banging for him, and he seemed pleased, though it was difficult\
  \ to tell given his grim demeanour. He gave me one of his sausages.\nLittle did\
  \ I know, as darkness fell upon the hills, that six months later I would stand on\
  \ stage accepting an award as runner-up in the Most Belligerent Soundtrack award\
  \ at a film festival in \u1E7Alm. Curiously, the trophy itself was a statuette of\
  \ a putto, curly-locked and chubby and armed with a bow and arrow. I took it home,\
  \ to my new home, just outside the town perimeter, and I put it on my mantelpiece,\
  \ and every now and then, as the fancy took me, I smashed it to smithereens with\
  \ a hammer, and then glued it back together. Now, when I wander in the hills tooting\
  \ my fife and banging my drum, the putti leave me be.\_\n[2009-04-04]"
