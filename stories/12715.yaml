text: "The recent death of Gabriel Garcia Marquez reminded me of the circumstances\
  \ that led me to read One Hundred Years Of Solitude, thirty-odd years ago\u2014\
  so long ago that, with my puny memory, I have forgotten the book entirely.\nI was\
  \ at university at the time. I had a friend, a fellow student, Stephen, who lived\
  \ in a house bought for him by his wealthy parents, and I rented a room in it one\
  \ summer. Stephen, being a good leftie, was somewhat ashamed of his economic privilege\
  \ and always referred to the \u201Clandlord\u201D, without divulging that this was\
  \ his father.\nOne day he found me reading a J. P. Donleavy novel, I can't recall\
  \ which one, and hectored me for wasting my time on trash. I should read, he said,\
  \ only great works of literature, such as, to pluck a title at random, One Hundred\
  \ Years Of Solitude. I was touched that he had my intellectual improvement at heart\
  \ and, shortly afterwards, I did indeed read Marquez's novel. I have to admit that,\
  \ all these years later, I have fonder memories of Donleavy.\nStephen and I lost\
  \ touch after university, but it has always amused me that this keen upholder of\
  \ cultural standards went on to become the television producer who created such\
  \ intellectually stimulating fare as Wife Swap. Stephen Lambert\u2014for it is he\u2014\
  may have cared deeply that I did not waste my time on trash, but it seems not to\
  \ have bothered him that he besmirched the cultural life of the entire nation.\n\
