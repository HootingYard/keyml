text: "\u201CThe principal function of Biblical exegesis\u201D, wrote Dobson in jaunty\
  \ mood one morning, \u201Cis for me to look with disdain upon the minnows who have\
  \ trod these paths before me.\u201D\nIt's hard to know whether the pamphleteer was\
  \ being deliberately muddle-headed with his image of walking minnows, but as I said,\
  \ he was in a jaunty mood, and at such times his prose could be perplexing. There\
  \ is no doubt, however, about the sincerity of his view that he had an unrivalled\
  \ grasp of the Bible. He did not write all that much about the holy book, but he\
  \ never lost an opportunity to pour scorn on scholars of the past such as Theodore\
  \ of Mopsuestia, Ludolph of Saxony, Pelagius, Tirinus of Antwerp, Manuel Sa, indeed\
  \ more scholars than you could shake a stick at, were you minded so to do. Dobson,\
  \ incidentally, was perhaps over-fond of shaking a stick at people or things of\
  \ which he disapproved, and attached an infant's rattle to one of his sticks the\
  \ better to make his point. His point was not always clear, either to him or to\
  \ the object of his stick-shaking, and eventually he was able to suppress this aspect\
  \ of his behaviour by attending a long course of therapy in a mountainous sanatorium\
  \ where the air was pure, the porridge was plain, and the calisthenics were invigorating.\n\
  The finest of Dobson's exercises in Biblical scholarship is his pamphlet The Four\
  \ Horsemen Of The Apocalypse\u2026 Or Were They? (out of print). The title is a\
  \ tad puzzling, but not for long, for in the very first sentence Dobson states his\
  \ case. \u201CI avow,\u201D he wrote \u201Cthat there were no horsemen of the Apocalypse,\
  \ nor, if there had been, were they four in number.\u201D In the sixty pages that\
  \ follow, he argued that a combination of mistranslation, forgery, and carelessness\
  \ had altered the original text, so that \u201Cfour\u201D was correctly \u201Ctwo\u201D\
  , and \u201Chorsemen\u201D was properly Englished as \u201Ccows\u201D, or possibly\
  \ \u201Cbees\u201D.\nChallenged by the local papal nuncio after publication as to\
  \ how two cows or two bees could symbolise famine, war, pestilence and death, Dobson\
  \ countered with a theological sally, probably the greatest of his sallies, theological\
  \ or otherwise. Sadly, there is no record of what he said, for Marigold Chew's recently-purchased\
  \ Boswellite tape recorder was out of order, having been placed too close to the\
  \ toaster that morning, and consequently smothered in a particularly toothsome marmalade.\n\
