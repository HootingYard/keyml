text: "Speaking of fishmongers, as we were (sort of) yesterday, this piece first appeared\
  \ in 2008. It was prompted by Rayner Heppenstall's observation that in one of his\
  \ poems, \u201CMr [T. S.] Eliot so oddly bids us to pray for fishmongers\u201D.\n\
  \u201COh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and plaice\u201D\
  \ is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer. This has the distinction\
  \ of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you will rarely\
  \ hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that, within the rolling\
  \ cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish, both edible and inedible,\
  \ are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial monomaniac named\
  \ Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger, nor indeed did he live\
  \ in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears\
  \ were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if they had been stuck to\
  \ his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by\
  \ a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders. Nine times out of\
  \ ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock's case it had precisely\
  \ the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain\
  \ after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and the mongering\
  \ of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged\
  \ version of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer in their services. But not many.\n[2015-04-23]"
