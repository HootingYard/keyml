text: "The Grauniad asks some of those who worked with him to share their memories\
  \ of the late Ken Russell. Among them, Glenda Jackson, who recalls:\nAs a director\
  \ he never said anything very specific. He'd say, \u201CIt needs to be a bit more\
  \ \u2026 urrrgh, or a bit less hmmm\u201C, and you knew exactly what he meant.\n\
  That's so true, isn't it? Paying due attention to the ellipsis, Hooting Yard has\
  \ been on a constant mission to be a bit more \u2026 urrrgh, and a bit less hmmm,\
  \ and we shall redouble our efforts in memory of the great man, until it's entirely\
  \ \u2026 urrrgh and there is not \_a trace of hmmm whatsoever.\n[2011-11-29]"
