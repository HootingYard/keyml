text: "When I was young, I was keen to study the fantastic architecture of the burning\
  \ cities. I enrolled in a college run according to Bl\xF6tzmannist principles. We\
  \ were taught to build scale models of the more outlandish buildings, from paper\
  \ and cardboard and gum, and to set fire to them and watch them burn, keeping a\
  \ safe distance. Viewed through heavy duty hectorscopes, from behind the potted\
  \ begonias and chrysanthemums in our workroom, the effect was astonishing. One could\
  \ imagine oneself standing, windswept, upon the tor, watching from that high peak,\
  \ with its glistening mere, the city in flames far below.\nAnd when it was reduced\
  \ to ashes and dust, what then? What then? Had we really been upon the tor, we would\
  \ have no city to return to. As the smoke dispersed, would we have trooped down\
  \ the far side of the tor and set out for new, undiscovered lands, to build and\
  \ burn anew? Pimply students, we need not risk such adventure. We took our brooms\
  \ and dustpans and swept up the ashes and then we left the workroom, laughing and\
  \ babbling, heading across the lawn, with its glistening pond, for the cafeteria.\n\
  And as we gobbled and drank, the college janitor locked up his cupboard, hung his\
  \ keys on the hook in the porch, and took the bus to the foot of the tor. Up he\
  \ trudged to the top, and he sat by the glistening mere, and looked upon the city,\
  \ and he wept.\n[2010-03-26]"
