text: "\nBefore reading the following, gaze at the picture above for a goodly amount\
  \ of time. You may wish to enlarge it to poster size, print it out, and pin it to\
  \ your noticeboard or wall.\nThe photograph shows a boffin and a mouse. Also shown\
  \ is certain arcane laboratory equipment, and a stencilled panel marked SPEC. NO.\
  \ 40642. It is not clear whether this designation refers to the equipment, the mouse,\
  \ or the boffin. Let us not bother our little heads about it.\nAt first glance,\
  \ it appears that the boffin is studying the mouse, and making notes in a ringbound\
  \ notepad, presumably appertaining to the mouse. The mouse is encased within some\
  \ kind of lidded laboratory bowl, for which I do not doubt there is a specific proprietary\
  \ name, of which I am tragically ignorant. The bowl is attached by a tube to the\
  \ arcane laboratory equipment and also, by wire, to something else, unseen, out\
  \ of camera shot. We might spend all day lost in conjecture about precisely what\
  \ that might be.\nWe might, but we won't, because we have other matters to attend\
  \ to. Though it is a racing certainty that the above summary is correct, and that\
  \ the boffin is indeed studying the mouse, there is an alternative possibility,\
  \ albeit an unlikely one. Consider again that the boffin is quite clearly making\
  \ notes. It could be that she is not a boffin but an amanuensis, and is actually\
  \ taking dictation from the mouse. Though the general run of mice are not gifted\
  \ with human speech, this mouse might be an exception. Or it may be that the boffin-amanuensis\
  \ is gifted with an understanding of mouse squeaks, and is able to transcribe them\
  \ for the benefit of other humans not so gifted. As I say, this is unlikely, even\
  \ outlandish, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility.\nI would dearly love\
  \ to see what is written in that notebook.\nOn purely pictorial evidence, we would\
  \ have to swat aside my foolish mouse-dictating-to-amanuensis scenario, if only\
  \ because of the power relations implicit in the photograph. The mouse is trapped\
  \ in the bowl, whereas the boffin can presumably wander off and skitter away to\
  \ do something else, in the laboratory or outside it. Lord knows what high jinks\
  \ she might get up to when not making notes about a mouse in a bowl!\nThere is also\
  \ the indubitable fact that the boffin is much, much bigger than the mouse. Humans\
  \ almost always have the upper hand in any interaction with mice, simply on account\
  \ of the size difference. When they are so tiny and we so huge, the matter of intellect\
  \ doesn't come into it. Even if mice were hyperintelligent, and humans dumb as oxen,\
  \ we could still overpower them physically. At least, let us hope so!\nOf course,\
  \ both the scenarios I have outlined, the almost certainly correct one and the harebrained\
  \ one, may be equally flawed. What if\u2014it is always worth asking what if?\u2014\
  the object of study is the boffin herself, or her interaction with the mouse? It\
  \ may be that the wire we see trailing out of the picture leads, not to some other\
  \ piece of arcane laboratory equipment, but back, under the work bench, out of our\
  \ sight, and is connected to the boffin. It may be, too, that the lidded bowl in\
  \ which the mouse is trapped is but a miniature mousy model of a much bigger lidded\
  \ bowl, in which both boffin and mouse are trapped. We may imagine similar tubes,\
  \ similar wires, protruding or feeding in to this uberbowl, calibrated and monitored\
  \ by higher boffins, one of whom is making notes in a ringbound notepad. Those notes\
  \ might pertain to the boffin only, or to the boffin and the mouse.\nThere is a\
  \ further possibility which scarcely bears thinking about, for it is all too terrifying.\
  \ What if\u2014again, what if?\u2014the higher boffins are not humans but mice?\
  \ Hyperintelligent mice, either gigantic ones from some far distant space age planet\
  \ of hyperintelligent giant mice set on conquest of the Earth, or a teeming throng\
  \ of thousands upon thousands of mouse-sized mice, whose very numbers serve to give\
  \ them an advantage over puny humankind? The object of their study might be to ascertain\
  \ how well, or ill, the boffin treats the mouse in its little lidded bowl. Her treatment\
  \ of the mouse will determine how the invading giant space mice thereafter treat\
  \ the human inhabitants of the conquered planet. Boy o boy, this is world-shuddering\
  \ stuff! The fate of millions, billions, may depend on just what the boffin does\
  \ next. If, having finished her notes, she removes the lid from the bowl and places\
  \ in it a little excelsior for the mouse to snuggle in for a rummage and snooze,\
  \ humanity may survive until the morrow. But if she cackles and pipes into the sealed\
  \ bowl, through the tube, poison gas to fell the mouse, then we are doomed, doomed.\n\
  There is a personal story here, too. Did the boffin realise, when she woke up that\
  \ morning, that she held the fate of humankind in her hands? No doubt such a thought\
  \ was the furthest thing from her mind as she tucked into her breakfast of boffins\u2019\
  \ vitamin-enriched poptarts. Later, as she took her white lab coat out of its locker\
  \ and pulled it on, was she daydreaming of her boyfriend Dan and their imminent\
  \ Alpine hiking holiday? And then . . . and then she stepped into what she thought\
  \ was a common or garden laboratory but was in fact a giant lidded bowl, watched\
  \ over and studied by hyperintelligent intergalactic space mice, armed with ringbound\
  \ notepads!\nThere may be further interpretations of the picture, convincing or\
  \ otherwise, which readers may wish to add in the comments. Meanwhile, I think it\
  \ is up to every one of us to decode precisely what is meant by that mysterious\
  \ stencil, SPEC. NO. 40642.\n[2012-09-20]"
