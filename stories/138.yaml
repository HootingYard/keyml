text: "Such a hullabaloo there was when they discovered Dobson's brain had been stolen!\
  \ One cub reporter called it the hullabaloo to end all hullabaloos. Initially beside\
  \ herself, Marigold Chew soon grew to appreciate the peace and quiet\u2014the unhullabaloo\u2014\
  in the house itself, where Dobson lay perfectly still, as if asleep, on a mattress.\
  \ She painted and sang and fed the squirrels in the garden. Occasionally she tiptoed\
  \ into the room where Dobson lay sprawled, and examined the sutures on his skull.\
  \ The police scientist agreed with her that it looked like a professional job. Detective\
  \ Captain Cargpan was convinced that the pamphleteer's brain was being kept in a\
  \ jar within a ten mile radius, and waited patiently for a ransom note. There was\
  \ further hullabaloo when a picture was sent to the Daily Screech, purporting to\
  \ show the brain on a platter, but painstaking analysis showed that it was just\
  \ a grey lump of dough. Some wondered if a heroic pooch would find Dobson's brain\
  \ while rummaging in a hedgerow, in a curious foreshadowing of the theft and recovery\
  \ of the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966, a year later. Marigold Chew listened to her\
  \ Xavier Cugat LPs and tended her hollyhocks and pasted cuttings into her scrapbook.\
  \ Detective Captain Cargpan filled his pipe with untreated Uruguayan tobacco and\
  \ paced up and down the garden path, praying for rain. He believed that a torrential\
  \ downpour would flush out the brain thieves. Time passed, and the hullabaloo died\
  \ down, and the cub reporter on the Daily Screech was embedded with a different\
  \ police force investigating a different case. And then, despite the weather remaining\
  \ balmy and sun-battered, one Thursday morning the postie came prancing along the\
  \ lane carrying a package. Detective Captain Cargpan let Marigold Chew unwrap it,\
  \ for she was deft where he was a butterfingers. She said \u201CGosh!\u201D as she\
  \ folded aside the last layer of blotting paper to reveal the pamphleteer's brain.\
  \ It was rather muddy, as if it had been kept in a ditch, but she rinsed it thoroughly\
  \ under the garden spigot and handed it to the police scientist, who scampered upstairs\
  \ and reinserted it into Dobson's head. No one ever did find out who had stolen\
  \ it, or where it had been stored, or whether any experiments had been carried out\
  \ on it. Detective Captain Cargpan pursued the case for another month or two, but\
  \ he was a maverick, so his manner of conducting his investigations was highly idiosyncratic,\
  \ and passeth all understanding.\n[2007-03-27]"
