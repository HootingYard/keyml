text: "The other day I very belatedly installed a programme that provides statistics\
  \ on this site, telling me how many visitors have alighted here, which posts they\
  \ have looked at, and so on. The most amusing feature is of course the list of search\
  \ terms, typed into Google or some other engine, which have brought the innocent\
  \ and unwitting to the big iron gates of Hooting Yard. I am preparing a post on\
  \ this topic, which should appear in the next few weeks.\nMeanwhile, however, I\
  \ was startled by one item in today's list of \u201Csearch terms people used to\
  \ find your blog\u201D. It is this:\nis frank key will self? hooting yard\nWell,\
  \ to whomsoever typed that, the answer is a resounding: No, of course not.\nAlthough\
  \ I would like to add that towards the fag end of last year, I went to see an art\
  \ installation called\_Seizure. It was located in a derelict and abandoned housing\
  \ estate in southeast London and, because it had gained rather a lot of publicity,\
  \ I thought it would be a good idea to arrive early to avoid being at the end of\
  \ a long and straggly queue. On the morning of my visit, however, the rain was teeming\
  \ down and Pansy Cradledew and I were only the second people to arrive. Ahead of\
  \ us was a family group, and I recognised among them the tall lugubrious figure\
  \ of Will Self. Shortly thereafter, I discovered that my cigarette lighter was kaput.\
  \ So I asked Mr Self for a light. In the downpour, he twice tried unsuccessfully\
  \ to light my cigarette, grumbled miserably about lighting his own cigarette first\
  \ and, having done so, proceeded to light mine. I said thank you, and he carried\
  \ on moaning to his family about the rain. So, although I am not Will Self, he did\
  \ light my cigarette in a downpour.\n[2009-02-25]"
