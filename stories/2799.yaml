text: "\nI recently posted a quotation from Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601), like Dobson\
  \ an (almost) out of print pamphleteer. I think it will be a good idea for me to\
  \ read his complete works, which include The Anatomy Of Absurdity, Nashe's Lenten\
  \ Stuffe, An Almond For A Parrot, and Have With You To Saffron Walden\u2014the latter\
  \ title alone filling me with glee. There is thus a chance that Hooting Yard will\
  \ get clogged with further Nashe quotations, but I am confident readers will enjoy\
  \ them.\n[2009-08-04]"
