text: "The usual pronunciation of vase, in this country, is as a rhyme with mars.\
  \ In the United States, it is more common for vase to rhyme with lace. Growing up\
  \ on an Essex council estate with a Belgian mother whose native tongue was Flemish,\
  \ however, I learned to rhyme vase with jaws.\nThis was but one example of my mother's\
  \ idiosyncratic English. She spoke of the old films we loved to watch as being \u201C\
  in white and black\u201D, and regularly deployed a sort of guttural expostulation\
  \ my sister still refers to as \u201Cthe Flemish sound\u201D. This was used to express\
  \ a vast swathe of emotions, from surprise to incredulity to contempt to disgust\
  \ to \u2026 well, pretty much any response.\nThe word chasm is one that we probably\
  \ encounter more in written than spoken English. My mother pronounced it with a\
  \ soft ch, as in chase or chicken. So I did too, on the rare occasions I said it\
  \ aloud. I only learned the correct, hard c pronunciation in my late teens, when\
  \ I was reading a passage aloud in an English class at school and my teacher raised\
  \ an amused eyebrow. He gently corrected me when I finished reading.\nMany years\
  \ have passed, but I still find myself drawn inexorably to the pronunciations I\
  \ learned at my mother's knee. And, intriguingly, my sister finds herself increasingly\
  \ using \u201Cthe Flemish sound\u201D as she grows older.\n[2016-03-06]"
