text: "\u201Cmy swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid\
  \ effluvia upon nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people's nerves\
  \ are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials,\
  \ to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound of villainous\
  \ smells, in which the most violent stinks, and the most powerful perfumes, contended\
  \ for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours,\
  \ arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank arm-pits,\
  \ sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations,\
  \ Hungary-water, spirit of lavender, asafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal\
  \ volatile; besides a thousand frowsy steams, which I could not analyse. Such, O\
  \ Dick! is the fragrant ether we breathe in the polite assemblies of Bath; such\
  \ is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the pure, elastic, animating air of the\
  \ Welsh mountains.\u201D\nTobias Smollett, The Expedition Of Humphry Clinker (1771)\n\
