text: "One twentieth-century Thursday, under a leaden sky, the balletomane Nan Kew\
  \ was gadding about the boulevards of Pointy Town when she encountered the Swiss\
  \ dramaturge Rolf Turge, accompanied by his deputy dramaturge Bob Dep.\nCue much\
  \ mwah! mwah! kissing of both air and cheeks, immediately after which Nan Kew, balletomane\
  \ that she was, began babbling excitedly about a new ballet she had seen only the\
  \ other day, a work of contemporary urgency in which the Hungarian toxic sludge\
  \ disaster was interpreted in the form of ungainly cavorting and the tooting of\
  \ piccolos.\n\u201CI agree it is both urgent and contemporary,\u201D Rolf Turge\
  \ managed to interrupt after ten minutes or so, \u201CBut it lacks the even greater\
  \ contemporaneity and hectic urgency with which a dramaturge, particularly a Swiss\
  \ one, would imbue it.\u201D\nBob Dep remained silent, for unlike many a deputy,\
  \ he was not facetious.\n\u201CEven were I to concede that so unimprovable a ballet\
  \ could be improved,\u201D said Nan Kew, \u201CSurely an indigenous Hungarian dramaturge\
  \ would out-turge one from Switzerland, no?\u201D\n\u201CMight I suggest,\u201D\
  \ said Rolf Turge, \u201CThat so ballet-bedizened is your balletomane brain that\
  \ the grand heroics of Swiss dramaturgy fall outwith your pond of competence?\u201D\
  \nHad they not been such fast pals, Nan Kew might have taken offence at this. As\
  \ it was, she made a mental note to ponder, next time she could concentrate on something\
  \ other than the ballet for a few minutes, Rolf Turge's curious choice of the image\
  \ of a pond to represent her area of knowledge and expertise.\nBob Dep, who was\
  \ skilled in the telepathic arts, chuckled and butted in.\n\u201CPonder ponds as\
  \ you like, Nan Kew, but the guvnor's usage merely reflects his, and my, current\
  \ preoccupation, which is the pond plays of Maud Wasp, the waspish playwright.\u201D\
  \n\u201CHave any of them been adapted as ballets?\u201D asked the balletomane, predictably.\n\
  \u201CNot as such,\u201D said Bob Dep. If examined, this could be seen as an enigmatic\
  \ statement, but though he was telepathic, the deputy was as enigmatic as he was\
  \ facetious, which is to say not at all.\nNan Kew was about to resume her seemingly\
  \ endless blathering about the Hungarian toxic sludge disaster ballet, but before\
  \ she could do so Swiss dramaturge Rolf Turge blurted out a dramatic expostulation.\n\
  \u201CLook!\u201D he cried, \u201CA hole has been dug in the road, by some agency\
  \ unknown to us, though we might surmise it to have been a fellow with a spade.\u201D\
  \nHe pointed, as only a Swiss dramaturge could, with an elegant beringed finger\
  \ at the hole, and both Nan Kew and Bob Dep peered where he pointed.\nThe two gentlemen\
  \ and the lady then contemplated the length of dug-up pipeline exposed by the digging.\
  \ At that very moment, the astonishingly tall Renaissance man Peter Blegvad was\
  \ passing by, and he executed a drawing of the scene, helping to make it vivid for\
  \ us.\n\nBut not, perhaps, as vivid as we would like. The original drawing was fanatic\
  \ with detail of Nan Kew, Rolf Turge, and Bob Dep, so much so that one might have\
  \ mistaken it for a hyperrealist linocut by noted hyperrealist linocutter Rex Hyper.\
  \ But when Peter Blegvad showed the finished drawing to the trio, they became strangely\
  \ fractious, and insisted that he obscure their features. Reluctantly, he did so,\
  \ as you can see.\nUnbeknownst to Peter Blegvad, the balletomane and the dramaturge\
  \ and the deputy dramaturge were each of them on the run from the Pointy Town police\
  \ force, following a series of crimes against the performing arts. How one might\
  \ commit such crimes is a mystery, as Mrs Robert Fripp might put it. Maud Wasp would\
  \ put it more waspishly, were anyone to ask her opinion. But nobody did, for she\
  \ lived in an ivory tower, with her pet wasp Martin, in an atmosphere of Jacobean\
  \ tragedy.\n[2010-10-10]"
