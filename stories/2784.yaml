text: "\u201CThere is a superstitious belief that swans cannot hatch their eggs unless\
  \ a storm is raging, the sky mad with lightning bolts and thunderclaps. I suspect\
  \ this is true, for on the countless occasions I have gone blundering into swans\u2019\
  \ nests, I have never seen eggs hatching, and the weather has invariably been balmy,\
  \ for that is the kind of weather I prefer when blundering about among the nests\
  \ of swans.\u201D\nFrom Quite A Few Things I Know About Swans by Dobson (out of\
