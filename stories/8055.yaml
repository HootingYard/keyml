text: "In a comment on my piece in today's Dabbler, Jonathan Law very helpfully tells\
  \ us that Rudyard Kipling was named after his parents\u2019 favourite reservoir.\
  \ It was on the banks of Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire, says Mr Law, that they met\
  \ and courted and it was here, conceivably, that the poet was conceived. \u201C\
  Clearly,\u201D he adds, \u201Cthis name-your-child-after-a-favourite-reservoir business\
  \ is an excellent custom and one that should be adopted by all who trust that their\
  \ offspring will go on to literary immortality.\u201D I would go further, and suggest\
  \ that it should be adopted by all, irrespective of any future literary achievement,\
  \ or lack thereof.\nI hesitate to say that the government should take a lead on\
  \ this, but some kind of concerted national effort will be needed. The first step\
  \ will be a voluntary agreement among publishers to make bonfires piled high with\
  \ copies of all their existing \u201Cbaby names\u201D books and restock the shelves\
  \ of our bookshops and libraries with \u201Creservoir names\u201D compendia. It\
  \ will probably be a good idea, however, to retain the current cover designs, usually\
  \ involving photographs of cute gurgling infants, in order to reinforce the message.\n\
  That should be simple enough, but the next stage may prove more difficult. Before\
  \ we can proudly claim to live in a land where all newborn babies are named after\
  \ their parents\u2019 favourite reservoirs, those parents will first of all actually\
  \ have to have a favourite reservoir. It is surprising just how many people do not.\n\
  As you know, I always like to back up my assertions with evidence, even if that\
  \ evidence comes from what our Belgian pals call Het Internet rather than from ancient\
  \ dusty leather-bound books. In this case, I searched Google for \u201Cmy favourite\
  \ reservoir\u201D, eliciting just 675 results, many of which can be discarded because\
  \ they refer, on closer inspection, to \u201Cmy favourite reservoir dog\u201D, which\
  \ is a different matter entirely. Restricting my search to sites based in the UK,\
  \ which after all is the land where I want my programme to be put into effect, yields\
  \ a mere 44 results, though I am pleased to say there do not seem to be any dogs\
  \ clogging up and thus distorting the data. But this hardly bodes well, does it?\n\
  That is why I speak of concerted national effort, and why our community education\
  \ hubs, as I think they are called, have such an important part to play. Before\
  \ prospective parents can choose a favourite reservoir, they will need to familiarise\
  \ themselves with as many reservoirs as possible. And while it is one thing to read\
  \ lists of reservoir names in the new-style baby name books, nothing beats direct\
  \ experience. That is why I recommend compulsory reservoir-bank picnicking opportunities\
  \ for youngsters, even before they are old enough to procreate. It is to be hoped\
  \ that by spending as much leisure time as possible hanging around on the banks\
  \ of reservoirs, when the time comes to go a-wooing and a-courting, no other possible\
  \ location will even enter their little heads.\nGiven the vagaries of British weather,\
  \ it is perhaps too much to hope that all babies in future will be conceived upon\
  \ the banks of reservoirs, as it is rumoured was the case with Rudyard Kipling.\
  \ Nevertheless, a few judicious and sensitively-worded guidelines could be incorporated\
  \ into sex education lessons, and perhaps some semi-permanent tents could be erected\
  \ on the banks of our reservoirs, supplied with mattresses and warm blankets. In\
  \ order that they do not spoil the view, such tents should probably be concealed\
  \ behind clumps of reservoir-bank shrubbery, where that is present, or otherwise\
  \ camouflaged, where it is not.\nThis seems to me an eminently practical plan of\
  \ campaign, and one which will reinvigorate the national spirit. In the meantime,\
  \ any prospective parents reading this can make a start by studying this list of\
  \ reservoirs and making due arrangements to visit each of them in turn. That way\
  \ you can plump for your favourite before your squalling infant comes triumphantly\
  \ into the world.\n\nRudyard Lake\_: a reservoir in Staffordshire\n[2012-01-06]"
