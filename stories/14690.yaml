text: "And the Lord said \u201CGather ye wool, and using needles thou shalt knit the\
  \ wool into the form of a chicken. And thou shalt stuff the chicken with kapok and\
  \ place it upon thy mantel. But the chicken shall lay no eggs, nor shall it cluck,\
  \ for it is a false chicken, of kapok and wool, and an abomination unto the eyes\
  \ of the Lord. And it shall be cast down from thy mantel, and unravelled, and the\
  \ kapok stuffing scattered, yea, upon the four winds, and the wool strewn across\
  \ many fields on thy father's land. Thus sayeth the Lord, regarding false chickens,\
  \ and other counterfeit poultry.\u201D\nThe Book Of Ipsy Dipsy Doo, chapter 5,891\n\
