text: "Several years ago we took a long hard look at the well-known story in which\
  \ the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. So compelling was our analysis that\
  \ there was general agreement, in both vulpine and canine circles, and more broadly,\
  \ that no further light could possibly be shed on the matter, at least not in our\
  \ lifetimes.\nBut lo! What is this? Writing from the fair land of Denmark, Jacob\
  \ Thoegersen has added a comment to the original potsage [sic] which, frankly, blows\
  \ the whole thing up a fresh spout. (I don't think that is a common phrase, or even\
  \ means anything, but it damned well ought to become part and parcel of our parlance,\
  \ daddy-o.) To ensure Mr Thoegersen's contribution does not lie neglected in the\
  \ archives, here is his comment in full:\nI thank you for your review, my dearest\
  \ Mr. Key, which I think\u2014in broad strokes\u2014sums up the most pertinent questions\
  \ to students of the story, the \u2018pillars\u2019 of our discipline.\nI think\
  \ you will agree with me also that many of the factual questions you raise will\
  \ in time be answered upon careful scrutiny of video documentation now published\
  \ (or is that \u2018leaked\u2019 one might speculate) about the incident:\nhttps://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/C16czVIWEAADzgj.mp4.\n\
  I advise all people to see the video and form their own opinions, but in my eyes,\
  \ the dog appears to be standing, it is of a light brown (cappuccino?) colour, and\
  \ the fox does indeed appear to be in a somewhat playful mood\u2014if \u2018playful\u2019\
  \ and \u2018mood\u2019 can be properly applied to canines.\nOf more interest, perhaps,\
  \ to students of the story is the new insights the video give about the performance\
  \ of the actual jump. How many of us, for instance, had in our mental reproduction\
  \ of the scene envisioned the fox *landing* on the dog. If I am not much mistaken,\
  \ the photographic evidence of this occurring will spawn much renewed interest,\
  \ will force us to rethink many interpretation we had come to accept as self-evident,\
  \ and, we may hope, open up entirely new avenues of research into the psychological\
  \ implications of the story.\nMy personal analysis on the history of studies in\
  \ the dog-and-fox story is that the community can be roughly divided between parabelists,\
  \ historist and omenists\u2014of course proposing this meta-theory will infuriate\
  \ many if not all scholars in the field, but alas, so is my burden\u2026:\nParableists\
  \ see the story as a parable, to be read for its symbolic and moral implications\
  \ (far too many and multiform to mention here\u2014not least because the emergence\
  \ of the video, I think we all must now agree, renders the entire avenue of thought\
  \ untenable). To parableists (or the agniostics if you prefer) it is irrelevant\
  \ whether the event actually occurred or not; the story has very real social and\
  \ human significance today irrespectably. Historists see the incident as an actual\
  \ occurrence of the past; omenists, on the other hand, see it as prophetic vision\
  \ of a future, possibly, messianic event (not unlike the less well researched story\
  \ of the lamb lying down with the lion published in a much inferior literary piece\
  \ of drivel whose name momentarily slips my mind but which may be familiar to your\
  \ readers).\nThe new video evidence should feed much renewed interest in the two\
  \ latter schools of thought: Is this the final proof that the quick brown fox did\
  \ indeed jump over the lazy dog\u2014and when and where did this then happen..?\
  \ Or is this the sign that Armageddon is upon us? I think we all agree that we are\
  \ living in intensely interesting\u2014what could be traumatizing\u2014times. I\
  \ for one shall sleep little while this new evidence is being scrutinized in labs\
  \ and offices around the world.\nAs to the implications for our field as such, I\
  \ believe this could be the time that lay people, average Janes and average Joes\
  \ around the world, realize that we are not, emphatically not, crackpots and monomaniacs.\
  \ Our studies have very serious and very real implications for the future of mankind.\
  \ I foresee a future of even more specialized journals and conferences, and perhaps\
  \ even an international newspaper dedicated to fox-and-dog'ology. I foresee a future\
  \ where any serious national newspaper worthy of its name will have a daily section\
  \ or a weekly supplement on current trends and new findings on a par with their\
  \ treatment of business, culture, weather, TV and politics. I foresee in other words,\
  \ brothers and sisters, a future where we will receive the same media coverage as\
  \ our colleagues and rivals in dogs-on-skateboard'ology. I have always held that\
  \ an important component in their media flair was the constant outpouring of new\
  \ photographic evidence which is only too eagerly lapped up (if you will excuse\
  \ the pun) by newsrooms.\nThese are exciting times, Mr. Key, and I trust you will\
  \ follow the development closely in your show. You have always been a leading light\
  \ in independent coverage of the news the people really want to know about.\nUPDATE\
  \ TO THE UPDATE\_: Mr Thoegersen has now added a further, perhaps even more compelling,\
  \ comment.\n[2017-01-13]"
