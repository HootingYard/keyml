text: "The greatest parenthesis in literature has already been written, and will never\
  \ be improved upon. It is from Lolita, where Nabokov writes: \u201CMy very photogenic\
  \ mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three.\u201D\n\
  But one must always be on the lookout for superb phrases, or complete sentences,\
  \ in parentheses, and there is a fine example in today's Guardian. Into her review\
  \ of The Woman Who Shot Mussolini by Frances Stonor Saunders, Lucy Hughes-Hallett\
  \ drops this marvel: \u201C(Rumour had it he kept a tortoise in his sporran.)\u201D\
  \n(One day I must set to work on an anthology of great parentheses.)\n[2010-02-27]"
