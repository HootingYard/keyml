text: "Like Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet, I am beautiful and clean and so very very\
  \ young. Well, that is not exactly the case. I am unprepossessing, faintly grubby,\
  \ and middle-aged. But then, Tony Hadley is no spring chicken either, if not quite\
  \ as old as me. But, all else being equal, and notwithstanding brute reality, and\
  \ both having my cake and eating it, I think I can justly claim to have beauty and\
  \ cleanliness and youth, in comparison with certain others. A one hundred year old\
  \ toad, sitting in a bog, for example. Put me next to that toad\u2014on a dais,\
  \ so I remain unsullied by bog-filth\u2014and I think you would have to agree that\
  \ if one of us is beautiful and clean and so very very young, it is certainly not\
  \ the centenarian toad. We will not invite Tony Hadley into the line-up.\nToads\
  \ do not feature largely in the Spandau Ballet story. Indeed, they do not feature\
  \ at all. I have read the literature, all of it, repeatedly, far beyond what is\
  \ reasonable, and I can tell you there is not a toad to be found anywhere, not in\
  \ The Spands\_: Harbingers Of Pop, nor in Ooh Ooh Ooh, This Much Is True, nor in\
  \ The Spandau Ballet Pop-Up Picture Book, nor in any of the other several dozen\
  \ volumes under which my bookshelf creaks. This is, I think, a great pity.\nMuch\
  \ would be explained were we to learn that the Kemp brothers, or Tony Hadley himself,\
  \ kept, as a child, a pet toad. (I know there were a couple of other Spands, but\
  \ nobody remembers who they were, or cares, other than their immediate families.)\
  \ Ask me to explain what, precisely, would be explained, and I will make a fastidious\
  \ gesture with my hands, and snort, and arrange my features into a withering look\u2014\
  a look that withers.\nDid Googie Withers ever listen to, say, Chant No. 1? It is\
  \ one of the greatest regrets of my life that I did not grab the opportunity to\
  \ ask her this question before she died, a couple of years ago, at the age of ninety-four.\
  \ Not that I had the opportunity. I never met her. But I could have ferreted about\
  \ for an email address or contact details, and put my query. I feel sure Googie\
  \ would have replied.\nOf course, I have other regrets, many, oh!, many. And in\
  \ all honesty, it is probably not true to say that the Withers/Chant No. 1 regret\
  \ is among the most heart-wrenching of them. Not really. When I said it was, I suppose\
  \ I was just trying to lend myself airs. It's a common failing, but I shouldn't\
  \ make excuses. I know that now. And I know it because I have spent untold hours\
  \ listening, at top volume, to the point where the neighbours complained to the\
  \ police, to the entire Spandau Ballet discography, including out-takes and demos,\
  \ on a loop, while gazing at large high definition hyperrealist pictures of toads,\
  \ with a magnifying glass. You should try it some time. If there is a better way\
  \ of clearing one's head of cobwebs and faff, I don't know what it is.\n[2013-05-15]"
