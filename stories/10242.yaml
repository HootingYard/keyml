text: "In his fascinating new book, beardy intellectual gadfly Slobodan Gadfly posits\
  \ a world in which the game of ping pong does not exist. He then proceeds to \u201C\
  invent\u201D it through the power of imagination. It would be easy to dismiss the\
  \ work as pointless pseudointellectual twaddle, and many critics have adopted precisely\
  \ that line. Here, for example, is Rolf Gutentag, writing in The Pingpongist:\n\
  Seldom have I read such a blithering farrago of drivel. My cat could write a more\
  \ sensible book than this. In fact, he has done. Meat In Jelly, Daytime Naps, And\
  \ The Torture Of Birds is available now from all good bookshops. But I digress.\
  \ Even if we accept Mr Gadfly's preposterous premise of a ping pong-less universe,\
  \ must we be subjected to page after page of his strenuous mental groping towards\
  \ some sort of fully-imagined tabletop-based indoor sport played with bats and lightweight\
  \ balls? As if that were not piffling enough, there is further piffle in store,\
  \ in the shape of an entire chapter devoted to a wholly imaginary scoring system\
  \ which turns out, on close inspection, to be identical to the actual scoring system\
  \ used in actual games of ping pong in the actual world.\nGutentag is positively\
  \ enthusiastic in comparison to Seebohm \u201CNot Susan\u201D Sontag, writing in\
  \ The New Pingpongist:\nNever, ever, in all my days, have I read such a blithering\
  \ farrago of drivel. As soon as I finished reading it, I burned it. Then I went\
  \ out to the bookshop where I had bought it and burned all the copies they had in\
  \ stock. Then, for good measure, I burned down the bookshop. As the flames licked\
  \ the sky, I held in one hand a ping pong bat and in the other hand a ping pong\
  \ ball, and when the fire brigade arrived, with bells clanging, I challenged every\
  \ man jack of them to a game of ping pong. Look!, I was saying, the game exists!\
  \ Why pretend it doesn't and then try to imagine it? The fire brigade could only\
  \ nod in agreement, thus proving the utter futility of Gadfly's thesis.\nI cannot\
  \ help but think that Messrs Gutentag and Sontag are missing the point of the book.\
  \ Quite what that point is I am not sure myself, but I have neither the time nor\
  \ the inclination to worry my little head about such niceties. And it is indeed\
  \ a little head, not much bigger than a ping pong ball, on account of certain mishaps\
  \ in the maternity ward where I was born. I am often asked if life has presented\
  \ me with insurmountable difficulties due to my tiny, white, and almost spherical\
  \ head, and my invariable answer is \u201Cno, it has not\u201D, for I carry myself\
  \ with aplomb and meet the astonished gazes of those I encounter with a steely gaze\
  \ of my own. If they continue to gaze, or to prod me with their fingers as if I\
  \ were a circus freak, I take from my pocket the ping pong bat I always carry about\
  \ my person and I thump them smartly on the head with it, several times.\nI do not\
  \ think it is necessary to understand the point of Mr Gadfly's book to enjoy it.\
  \ I would go further, and say it is not necessary to understand the point of any\
  \ book to enjoy it. What, after all, is the point of Rolf Gutentag's cat's book?\
  \ Does it give us new insights into feline life? It does not. Does it, more importantly,\
  \ tell us of a cat's approach to the game of ping pong? It does not. Indeed, save\
  \ for one passage in which the cat-narrator chases a ping pong ball around a confined\
  \ space, in a state of frenzy, there is no mention of ping pong at all. This absence,\
  \ or lacuna, makes it a highly unusual book, at least in my experience. And that,\
  \ perhaps, is the point.\nAnd as much as I enjoyed the cat's book, so I enjoyed\
  \ Slobodan Gadfly's. The opening chapter, in which he paints a vivid picture of\
  \ a universe in which ping pong does not exist, and never has existed, is a tour\
  \ de force. It is a world very much like our own, in almost every particular. It\
  \ even has a few people in it like myself, with ping pong ball-size heads, though\
  \ of course we are not described as such, for in this alternative universe without\
  \ ping pong, there are of necessity no ping pong balls. Gadfly has to invent them,\
  \ just as he has to invent the bat and the net and the rules and the scoring system.\
  \ And invent them he does, each in turn.\nHe does not spare us the details of his\
  \ mental agony. There are false starts, wrong turnings, red herrings, and mind-bogglingly\
  \ stupid decisions. In chapter four, for example, Gadfly recounts his struggle to\
  \ imagine a ping pong ball. As yet, he has no concept of either the bat or the net\
  \ or the rules or the scoring system. He has not even arrived at the idea that the\
  \ game might be an indoor one played on a tabletop. Indeed, he has not even thought\
  \ of the game. At this stage, his only concern is the ball\u2014in his parallel\
  \ universe, a wholly new type of ball which he challenges himself to bring into\
  \ existence. Laughably, the first ping pong ball he conceives is the size and shape\
  \ and texture of a medicine ball. It is not absolutely identical to a medicine ball,\
  \ of course, for they already exist in his ping pong-less world.\nWhile I was reading\
  \ this chapter, with its tragic undertone, I could not help but become engulfed\
  \ by my own imaginings. I wondered what my life would be like if, instead of having\
  \ a ping pong ball head, I had a medicine ball head? It was easy enough to posit\
  \ a slightly different maternity ward mishap that could have had such an outcome\
  \ for my head. But I found it far more difficult to picture how different things\
  \ would have been for me. Would I still go about with a ping pong bat in my pocket,\
  \ ready to strike the impolite? And if I did not, how would I deal with such people?\
  \ Trying to fathom the answers to these questions made me all the more admiring\
  \ of Slobodan Gadfly's great act of imagination, in inventing, from nothing, the\
  \ game of ping pong.\nHooting Yard Rating\_: Seventeen stars.\nYou may also enjoy\_\
