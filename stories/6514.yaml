text: "Upon Pang Hill, there is a plaque, battered and burnished and copper and commemorative,\
  \ affixed to a stone marking the spot once occupied by the Pang Hill Plop Pit, the\
  \ pit into which generations of tinies from Pang Hill Orphanage plopped things discarded\
  \ and abandoned. Incessant rainfall in those parts meant that there was forever\
  \ a puddle at the bottom of the pit, and the presence of the puddle meant that when\
  \ a thing discarded or abandoned was tossed into it, the thing made a plop as, tossed\
  \ and falling, it landed in the puddle. Oft times the depth of the puddle was such\
  \ that the plopping thing was wholly submerged under the rainwater. Sometimes, when\
  \ rainfall was light, was but a drizzle, much of the puddle water would leach into\
  \ the muck, and the puddle become shallow, and then the thing discarded or lost\
  \ would remain visible, to those who looked, until a storm came, and the puddle\
  \ level rose, and the waters covered the tossed-away abandonee.\nOnce a week, on\
  \ Thursday mornings, the Pang Hill Plop Pit became a bubbling fizzing fuming frothing\
  \ gaseous pit. The Orphanage Janitor emptied into it numerous pailfuls of nigh-impossibly\
  \ corrosive acid, which dissolved all the items tossed and plopped into the puddle\
  \ during the previous seven days. By dusk on Thursdays the acid had done its work\
  \ and further rainfall served to dilute the puddle and it ceased to bubble and fizz\
  \ and fume and froth.\nWe have a record of all that was tossed away to plop into\
  \ the Plop Pit, for the orphans were charged to maintain log books. Here are some\
  \ telling extracts, from a recent compilation published by the Pang Hill Orphanage\
  \ Documentary Archive. I have obliterated the dates, through a lack of pernicketiness.\n\
  Orphan Carstairs. Chucked into the plop pit several lobster pots of no further use\
  \ since the imposition of the revised sea creature protocol.\nOrphan Brandt. Up\
  \ bright and early that day, feeling awful, and out to take a turn by the Pang Hill\
  \ Plop Pit, and tossed into it cheesecloth trousers rent in many places following\
  \ bramble bush and hornets mishap.\nOrphan Cuddy. Into the pit plopped wrench, awl,\
  \ adze, cutters and pincers.\nOrphan Furbelow. Dun flap o\u2019 tarp, eggs o\u2019\
  \ larks, talc \u2018n\u2019 seed sprinkler, Jap keg lid, sconce \u2018n\u2019 punnet.\
  \ All thrown into the Pit o\u2019 Plops, all sank in the puddle, to be forgot.\n\
  Yet due to the log books, nothing is forgotten. Tossed away, plopped into the pit,\
  \ discarded and abandoned and eaten by the janitor's acid, every last item is granted\
  \ immortality. The orphans themselves have perished, the long line of janitors too,\
  \ the Orphanage crumbled to ruin, even the battered and burnished and copper and\
  \ commemorative sign hangs from a single rusty nail and will one day fall and be\
  \ buried in the muck. Pang Hill itself will be flattened by tectonic shifts or cataclysm.\
  \ The sound of the plops, though, travels on, across unimaginable distances, in\
  \ space and time, and with it the memory of all that was discarded, of all that\
  \ was abandoned, of all things.\n[2011-04-27]"
