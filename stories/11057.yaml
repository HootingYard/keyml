text: "One of my uncles was a hedger who had his own ditch, and another uncle was\
  \ a ditcher who laid claim to a hedge. That's the thing about being a peasant, it\
  \ can be mightily confusing. When I was a tot I always used to get the hedger uncle\
  \ and the ditcher uncle mixed up. Their brother\u2014my father\u2014tried to teach\
  \ me which was which, though his pedagogical methods were rather unusual. He seemed\
  \ to believe I might learn to tell a hedger from a ditcher by penning me in a pig\
  \ sty among the many pigs from dawn till dusk, with slate and chalk, and a sort\
  \ of metal harness on my head, a contraption he had beaten out of a broken churn.\n\
  My father, you see, unlike his brothers, was a peasant with ideas. Few if any of\
  \ them were sensible ideas, nor were any of them the fruits of rustic wisdom, handed\
  \ down through the ages. No, my father's ideas sprang fully-formed into his head.\
  \ It was an odd head, a bit too large for his body, plum-coloured, and topped with\
  \ an extravagant bouffant that might better have suited a maestro of the opera house.\
  \ Somebody had once told my father that his head had to be a bit too big in order\
  \ to contain comfortably his gigantic brain. That they were joshing him never occurred\
  \ to Papa. He really believed, in the absence of any X-rays or probes or scans,\
  \ that he had an enormous, and concomitantly powerful, brain.\nWhen he died I took\
  \ it upon myself to remove the brain from his skull, using a saw, and I discovered\
  \ it to be no bigger than the average adult human brain. If anything, it veered\
  \ towards the smaller size. I put it in a jar filled to the brim with brine, screwed\
  \ the cap on tight, and then released his body to the priest for burial, but not\
  \ before gluing the top of his head back on to conceal evidence of my unauthorised\
  \ sawing.\nHe was the first of the brothers to go, so when I held a little wake,\
  \ after the funeral, both my uncles, the hedger with the ditch and the ditcher with\
  \ the hedge, were present. They were leaning against the pig sty fence, glugging\
  \ grog from tin beakers, and muttering to each other in their guttural barbaric\
  \ peasant argot. It made no sense to me, as one of my father's mad ideas had been\
  \ to bring me up to speak as if I were a person of consequence in the world. Thus\
  \ my speaking voice, in addition to my slate and chalk and my metal head-harness,\
  \ marked me out from my fellows and made of me something of an oddball.\nNow that\
  \ Papa was dead I felt I should get to know my uncles better, or at least well enough\
  \ to tell the one from the other. I thought they might be interested to see the\
  \ brain in the jar, so I took it from the shelf in the barn where I kept it and\
  \ approached them at the pig sty fence.\n\u201CHello, uncles,\u201D I piped up,\
  \ in my hi-falutin voice, \u201CLook what I've got here!\u201D\nThey turned, the\
  \ hedger and the ditcher, from gazing at the pigs to gazing at me. In their eyes\
  \ I saw thousands of years of stupidity and rustic ignorance, and at once I knew\
  \ I would never be able to make myself understood to them. The hedger, or possibly\
  \ the ditcher, grunted, and the other belched.\n\u201CThis is Papa's brain,\u201D\
  \ I said, waving the jar in front of them, \u201CYou see, it was not so huge after\
  \ all.\u201D\nThen they both spat into their beakers, and each mussed my hair, or\
  \ as much of it as they could muss through the metal harness, and they trudged away,\
  \ the one to his hedge or ditch and the other to his ditch or hedge.\nOh, it was\
  \ all so long ago. I think of them now, my uncles, as I slump at my desk in my ivory\
  \ tower, surrounded by fat dusty books in incomprehensible languages, and up there,\
  \ on a high shelf, sits the jar of brine containing my father's brain. It has shrivelled\
  \ over the years, until it is a tiny thing, a tiny thing indeed.\nNOTE\_: I suddenly\
  \ recall that I wrote an earlier piece with the title\_Hedger And Ditcher, which\
  \ is also preoccupied with my father. It is worth noting that the fathers in both\
  \ pieces are wholly fictional, and if they bear any resemblance to my real father\
  \ at all, it is a lopsided resemblance born in my brain.\n[2013-02-23]"
