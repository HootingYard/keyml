text: "At Mustard Plaster, a splendid recipe for bubble and squeak by Christopher\
  \ Smart:\n\u201CTake of Beef, Mutton, or Lamb, or Veal, or any other meat, two Pounds\
  \ and an half, or any other Quantity; let it lay in Salt, till the saline Particles\
  \ have lock'd up all the Juices of the Animal, and render'd the Fibres too hard\
  \ to be digested; then boil it over a Turf or Peat Fire, in a Brass Kettle cover'd\
  \ with a Copper Lid, till it is much done. Then take Cabbage (that which is most\
  \ windy, and capable of producing the greatest Report) and boil it in a Bell-Metal\
  \ Pot till it is done enough, or if you think it proper, till it is done too much.\
  \ Then slice the beef, and souse that and the Cabbage both in a Frying-Pan together,\
  \ and let it bubble and squeak over a Charcoal Fire, for half an Hour, three Minutes,\
  \ and two Seconds. Then eat a Quantum sufficit, or two Pounds and a half, and after\
  \ it drink sixteen Pints of fat Ale, smoak, sleep, snoar, belch, and forget your\
  \ Book.\u201D\n[2010-11-02]"
