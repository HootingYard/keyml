text: "\u201CPeople who are only aware of Jabir (or Geber as he was known in the medieval\
  \ West) as the name of an early scientist, may not be aware of what richly bizarre\
  \ treasures are to be found in his strangely diverse writings: sperm is a crucial\
  \ ingredient in the elixir of life; bird sperm is needed for producing a man with\
  \ wings; the effigy of a Chinaman in bed will keep one awake at night; a picture\
  \ of a man killing snakes done in magical ink will actually kill snakes; there is\
  \ a fish called \u201Cthe doctor of the sea\u201D that carries a stone in its head\
  \ that has the power to cure all ills; putrefied hair generates serpents; demons\
  \ can be usefully trapped in statues. In the monumental Jabir ibn Hayyan: Contribution\
  \ \xE0 l'histoire des id\xE9es scientifiques dans l'Islam, Paul Kraus (1904\u2013\
  44), a genius who committed suicide at an early age, surveyed the Jabirian corpus,\
  \ which covered sexology, alchemy, the art of warfare, the manufacture of talismans,\
  \ artisanal techniques, religious polemic, grammar, music, invisible inks, the artificial\
  \ generation of human beings and much else.\u201D\nFrom this book review.\n[2008-01-30]"
