text: "On Thursday morning, BamBam went haywire. That is all I am prepared to say\
  \ on the subject. You may have questions, such as who or what is BamBam?, what is\
  \ the etymology of the word haywire?, and so on, but quite frankly it is not up\
  \ to me to spoonfeed you. I fail to see why you should not do your own research\
  \ into these matters, thus freeing me for more important tasks, such as taking a\
  \ well-earned nap, smoking a gasper while gazing out of the window, or stuffing\
  \ my gob with a pile of Smokers\u2019 Poptarts. Any of those choices would be a\
  \ better use of my time than telling you about BamBam going haywire.\nOh please\
  \ please Mr Key!, I hear you wail, Do tell us more! To which I reply, certainly\
  \ not. At most, I might give you some pointers to help you conduct your own research.\
  \ For the etymology of the word haywire, I can think of no better reference source\
  \ than the Oxford English Dictionary. Oh, wait, I can think of a better source\u2014\
  Dobson's pamphlet Everything You Ought To Know About Hay, And Words Beginning With\
  \ Hay- (out of print). In fact I am surprised not to have recommended this pamphlet\
  \ to you before. It is the most haycentric of all Dobson's works, and its first\
  \ edition, of ten Gestetnered copies, actually had a cover to which strands of real\
  \ hay were affixed, with glue. This had the unfortunate effect of partly obscuring\
  \ the title, with the result that the pamphlet sold even fewer copies than was usually\
  \ the case.\nIf you do your research thoroughly, you will probably be exhausted\
  \ by the time you are fully conversant with the word haywire. Your head will be\
  \ so crammed with new and exciting information that there will be no room left to\
  \ add anything at all. That being so, it seems rather pointless for me to tell you\
  \ where you could discover further information about BamBam. Nevertheless, there\
  \ will always be two or three scallywags who don't know when to stop, who will plough\
  \ on regardless. Such persons are very exasperating, like hyperactive tots, and\
  \ should not be encouraged. I find the best way to deal with them is to administer\
  \ a dose of Ox-Stun, a proprietary tranquiliser more commonly used to stun oxen,\
  \ at such times as one needs to stun oxen, which, depending on circumstances, can\
  \ be every Thursday morning or once in a blue moon.\nNow, everybody sing along\_\
  : Blue moon, You saw me standing alone Without a dream in my heart Without a love\
  \ of my own\u2026\n[2014-10-03]"
