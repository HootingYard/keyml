  \ most spectacular monuments [in Kensal Green cemetery] is the \xC2\xA33,000 tomb\
  \ of Andrew Ducrow, an Egyptian extravaganza that The Builder dismissed as \u2018\
  ponderous coxcombry\u2019. Ducrow (1793\u20131842) was a showman, \u2018the Colossus\
  \ of Equestrians\u2019, who wrestled with lions, re-enacted scenes from Napoleonic\
  \ battles, and could lift four or five children using nothing more than his teeth.\u201D\
  \nWe are not told if the children in question were pious Victorian orphans, but\
  \ I expect they were.\n[2007-07-20]"
