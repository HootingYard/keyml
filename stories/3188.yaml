text: "Christians have their seminaries, and Muslims their madrassas\u2014but where\
  \ is the school for the aspirant Aztec fundamentalist? I speak of myself, of course.\
  \ Home study is all very well, and I have tried to be diligent, but in the absence\
  \ of a collegiate setting, I am falling prey to the lure of rival, and surely heretical,\
  \ faiths.\nThis little complaint was occasioned by my stumbling upon an account\
  \ of a Mayan rebirthing ceremony. True Aztec believers, even the most wishy-washy,\
  \ should guard against falling into the Mayan embrace. And yet\u2026 is there not\
  \ something irresistible in this Times report of 2001?\nThe ceremony took place\
  \ at dusk. Mr Blair and his wife, wearing bathing costumes, were led to the Temazcal,\
  \ a brick-coloured pyramid on the south end of the beach\u2026 Ms Aguilar told the\
  \ Blairs to bow and pray to the four winds as Mayan prayers were read out. Each\
  \ side of the building is decorated with Mayan religious symbols: the sun and baby\
  \ lizards representing spring and childhood; a bird to signify adolescence, summer\
  \ and freedom; a crab to represent maturity and autumn; and a serpent\u2014the most\
  \ sacred in the Mayan Indian culture\u2014to symbolise winter and transformation\u2026\
  \nWithin the Temazcal, a type of Ancient Mayan steam bath, herb-infused water was\
  \ thrown over heated lava rocks, to create a cleansing sweat and balance the Blairs\u2019\
  \ \u2018energy flow\u2019.\nMs Aguilar chanted Mayan songs, told the Blairs to imagine\
  \ that they could see animals in the steam and explained what such visions meant.\
  \ They were told the Temazcal was like the womb and those participating in the ritual\
  \ must confront their hopes and fears before \u2018rebirth\u2019 and venturing outside.\
  \ The Blairs were offered watermelon and papaya, then told to smear what they did\
  \ not eat over each other's bodies along with mud from the Mayan jungle outside.\n\
  The prime minister, on holiday just a month before the 11 September attacks, is\
  \ understood to have made a wish for world peace.\nBefore leaving, the Blairs were\
  \ told to scream out loud to signify the pain of rebirth. They then walked hand\
  \ in hand down the beach to swim in the sea.\nQuoted in How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered\
  \ The World\_: A Short History Of Modern Delusions by Francis Wheen (2004). Elsewhere\
  \ in this splendid book, we are reminded that Margaret Thatcher was a devotee of\
  \ mystical \u2018electric baths\u2019.\n[2009-09-25]"
