text: "A couple of years ago I had reason to mention a crevasse wanker. Today, while\
  \ solving the Guardian crossword, I was reminded of that rather more charming figure\
  \ of the mountaineering world, Gertrude Chumpot, known as the crevasse poppet (16\
  \ down, 3 down). Gertrude earned this soubriquet because she was a sort of one-woman\
  \ mountain rescue service, adept at saving the lives and limbs of hapless mountaineers\
  \ who, not looking where they were going, plummeted down crevasses to what would\
  \ otherwise have been certain death.\nOne of the great mysteries of the crevasse\
  \ poppet was the manner in which she effected her rescues. Eschewing the usual kit\
  \ of ropes and pitons and whatever else is used by standard mountain rescue teams,\
  \ she employed a form of inexplicable mesmerism. Standing at the edge of a crevasse\
  \ wherein languished a moaning ninny who had fallen in some minutes earlier, Gertrude\
  \ would make enigmatic sweeping movements of her arms while babbling gibberish and\
  \ gazing at the sky. By this means, she somehow levitated the nitwit out of the\
  \ crevasse. At least, that is what she told the Commission of Inquiry when it was\
  \ considering whether to prosecute her for witchcraft. She was such a charming poppet\
  \ that the case was dropped.\nThe crossword is particularly ingenious because it\
  \ is littered with references to her story. The chairman of the Commission, for\
  \ example, was an unromantic taciturn Lett (23 across, 1 down, 24 across), named\
  \ Arpad Klingklang. Arriving for the first session on his horse (9 across), he gave\
  \ a press conference where he stated that he was ready to burn Gertrude Chumpot\
  \ immediately, given that in his view it was a clear case of possession (11 across)\
  \ by Old Nick (10 across). The crevasse poppet had only been on the witness stand\
  \ for a few minutes, however, before the Lett was like a moonstruck calf, hopelessly\
  \ in love. Soon enough, he called proceedings to a halt, put all the paperwork through\
  \ a shredder (5 down), and was persuaded to take a rest cure (26 across) at a seaside\
  \ resort (7 down), where he spent his time drinking caf\xE9 noir (8 across), dancing\
  \ the habanera (20 across) with various ladies (22 across), and poring over erotica\
  \ (17 across). In an attempt to rid him of his Gertrude-mania, the staff fed him\
  \ a diet of gruel containing bits of leek (2 down) and locust (22 down).\nThere\
  \ are several Alpine folk songs about the crevasse poppet, usually yodelled to the\
  \ accompaniment of an alpenhorn. If you listen to them you will probably need to\
  \ take a rest cure yourself.\n[2014-10-22]"
