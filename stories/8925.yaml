text: "After four nervy months, [Gladstone] came close to proposing at the Coliseum\
  \ on a moonlit January evening. A few days later he did it instead by letter. It\
  \ was not a proposal to sweep a young girl off her feet.\n\u201CI seek much in a\
  \ wife in gifts better than those of our human pride, and am also sensible that\
  \ she can find little in me,\u201D he wrote, in a single long-winded sentence, \u201C\
  sensible that, were you to treat this note as the offspring of utter presumption,\
  \ I must not be surprised: sensible that the life I invite you to share, even if\
  \ it be not attended, as I trust it is not, with peculiar disadvantages of an outward\
  \ kind, is one, I do not say unequal to your deserts, for that were saying little,\
  \ but liable at best to changes and perplexities and pains which, for myself, I\
  \ contemplate without apprehension, but to which it is perhaps selfishness in the\
  \ main, with the sense of inward dependence counteracting an opposite sense of my\
  \ too real unworthiness, which would make me contribute to expose another\u2014\
  and that other!\u201D\nOn receiving the letter Catherine pleaded for time, no doubt\
  \ hoping it would give her the opportunity to work out exactly what Gladstone meant.*\n\
  *\u201DHe really was a frightful old prig,\u201D wrote Clement Attlee\u2026 on reading\
  \ this letter in a biography of Gladstone, \u201CFancy writing a letter proposing\
  \ marriage including a sentence of 140 words all about the Almighty. He was a dreadful\
  \ person.\u201D\nfrom The Lion And The Unicorn\_: Gladstone vs Disraeli by Richard\
