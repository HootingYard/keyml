text: "A letter to The Times, from \u201CC.L.S.\u201D, 16th August 1871:\nSir,\u2014\
  On Monday last I had the misfortune of taking a trip per steamer to Margate. The\
  \ sea was rough, the ship crowded, and therefore most of the Cockney excursionists\
  \ prostrate with sea-sickness. On landing on Margate pier I must confess I thought\
  \ that, instead of landing in an English seaport, I had been transported by magic\
  \ to a land inhabited by savages and lunatics. The scene that ensued when the unhappy\
  \ passengers had to pass between the double line of a Margate mob on the pier must\
  \ be seen to be believed possible in a civilized country. Shouts, yells, howls of\
  \ delight greeted every pale-looking passenger, as he or she got on the pier, accompanied\
  \ by a running comment of the lowest, foulest language imaginable. But the most\
  \ insulted victims were a young lady, who, having had a fit of hysterics on board,\
  \ had to be assisted up the steps, and a venerable-looking old gentleman with a\
  \ long grey beard, who, by-the-by, was not sick at all, but being crippled and very\
  \ old, feebly tottered up the slippery steps leaning on two sticks. \u201CHere's\
  \ a guy!\u201D\_ \u201CHallo! You old thief, you won't get drowned, because you\
  \ know that you are to be hung,\u201D etc., and worse than that, were the greetings\
  \ of that poor old man. All this while a very much silver-bestriped policeman stood\
  \ calmly by, without interfering by word or deed; and myself, having several ladies\
  \ to take care of, could do nothing except telling the ruffianly mob some hard words,\
  \ with, of course, no other effect than to draw all the abuse on myself. This is\
  \ not an exceptional exhibition of Margate ruffianism, but, as I have been told,\
  \ is of daily occurrence, only varying in intensity with the roughness of the sea.\
  \ Public exposure is the only likely thing to put a stop to such ruffianism ; and\
  \ now it is no longer a wonder to me why so many people are ashamed of confessing\
  \ that they have been to Margate.\n[2009-05-06]"
