text: "You don't expect to find a cad in a grotto. But that is exactly what I discovered\
  \ during a spot of seaside spelunking many years ago. I had abseiled down a cliff,\
  \ having been told by my colleague Dennis Pivot that there was, at its foot, partly\
  \ submerged under water, a grotto which, he thought, was the portal to a magnificent\
  \ and extensive system of caves never before explored.\n\u201CWhat makes you think\
  \ that, Dennis?\u201D I had asked him, as we ate sausages in a seaside cafeteria.\n\
  \u201CClues strewn in various rare manuscripts of olden times,\u201D he said. When\
  \ I pressed him for further details, he pretended to be chewing on a piece of gristle,\
  \ then gagged, spat into a napkin, and keeled over. It was a convincing performance,\
  \ and at the time I had absolutely no idea he was dissembling.\nI hired some kit\
  \ and headed for the cliff. It was a squally day. Gulls were screaming their heads\
  \ off. My ears are oversensitive to certain bird shrieks, so I stuffed them with\
  \ cotton wool. Then I abseiled like the abseiling expert I am down the cliff face.\
  \ What with the cotton wool and my cushioned helmet I couldn't hear a thing. At\
  \ the bottom of the cliff, I swung myself into the grotto. I unfastened myself from\
  \ my abseiling rope and stood for a moment or two, knee deep in sloshing seawater,\
  \ to catch my breath. That is when I saw the cad.\nHe came looming out of the Platonic\
  \ shadows at the back of the grotto, a dapper fellow in spite of the cheapness of\
  \ his suit. Like many a postwar cad, he bore a striking resemblance to the actor\
  \ Terry-Thomas (1911\u20131990).\n\u201CHello old chap!\u201D he said, \u201CI say,\
  \ you couldn't see your way to loaning me a few bob, could you? Had a run of bad\
  \ luck on the old gee-gees, you know how it is.\u201D\nI couldn't hear a word he\
  \ said, and gestured to indicate as much. Then I took off my helmet and prised the\
  \ cotton wool out of my ears and asked him to repeat himself. After he had done\
  \ so, I explained that I never carried cash when abseiling, for fear it might fall\
  \ from my pocket into the merciless sea.\n\u201CDrat!\u201D, he said, and then offered\
  \ to place some bets for me if I met up with him at Waterloo Station on the following\
  \ Thursday and forwarded him several hundred pounds.\nI promised to think about\
  \ it, though in truth my puritanical ways made it very unlikely that I would ever\
  \ get embroiled in any form of gambling.\n\u201CTell me something,\u201D I said,\
  \ \u201CYou seem to be familiar with this grotto. I've been led to believe it leads\
  \ to a magnificent and extensive system of caves never before explored. Is that\
  \ indeed the case?\u201D\n\u201CI haven't got the foggiest,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  Only been here a couple of weeks, haven't quite got my bearings.\u201D\nThis surprised\
  \ me. I had always thought it a characteristic of cads that they were quick to grasp\
  \ the possibilities of whatever circumstances they found themselves in. I put this\
  \ to him, without actually calling him a cad. By way of reply, he changed the subject.\n\
  \u201CI say, you couldn't loan me those bits of cotton wool, could you? I'm being\
  \ driven crackers by the shrieking of those damnable gulls.\u201D\nI was reluctant\
  \ to relinquish my makeshift earmuffs, and told him so. I still cannot remember\
  \ how he managed to wheedle them out of me, nor how he convinced me to let him try\
  \ on my abseiling harness, which, having donned, he attached to the rope dangling\
  \ at the grotto's opening, whereupon he rapidly ascended, leaving me alone. The\
  \ sloshing seawater was now up to my waist.\nThere was nothing for it but to make\
  \ my way deeper into the grotto, in the hope of discovering a magnificent and extensive\
  \ system of caves never before explored. But was my colleague Dennis Pivot right,\
  \ or was he talking twaddle, as he so often did?\nOn this occasion, I am relieved\
  \ to report, he was bang on the money. I spent several days clambering about underground,\
  \ the first man to see, oh!, such wonders!\nBut when Thursday came I determined\
  \ to find my way back to the grotto and then, somehow, up the cliff face. I remembered\
  \ I had an appointment to meet the cad at Waterloo Station, and though I had no\
  \ intention of giving him several hundred pounds to bet on the horses on my behalf,\
  \ I dearly wanted to retrieve my abseiling harness and rope and cotton wool.\nWhen\
  \ I got to the grotto, the tide was in, and the sloshing seawater came up to my\
  \ neck. Without my abseiling gear, I knew I could not hope to scale the cliff, so\
  \ I decided to plunge ahead and make a swim for it. There was a terrible risk that\
  \ I would be dashed to pieces on the rocks. Luckily, I managed, by dint of advanced\
  \ swimming techniques, to steer my way through the tremendous currents, and by midday\
  \ I was panting on a shingle beach. I was exhausted and sodden and had numerous\
  \ tiny crustacean beings snagged in my hair, but I was alive.\nStopping only for\
  \ a reviving cuppa in a seaside cafeteria, I caught a train to Waterloo Station.\
  \ And there, on the concourse, waiting for me, I spotted the cad. I squelched towards\
  \ him.\n\u201CThere you are, old bean,\u201D he said, \u201CHave you got a wodge\
  \ of the folding stuff?\u201D\n\u201CNo I have not!\u201D I cried, \u201CI am of\
  \ puritanical bent and I never bet on the horses. I have come for my abseiling harness\
  \ and rope and my cotton wool, with which I entrusted you in the grotto.\u201D\n\
  \u201COf course, old boy, of course,\u201D he said, a gleam of mischief in his eyes,\
  \ \u201CI put them in a locker for safe keeping. Here\u2014\u201C and he handed\
  \ me a key\u2014\u201CNumber 666. Be seeing you!\u201D And he scarpered.\nI asked\
  \ a railway person where the lockers were, and went straight to them. I inserted\
  \ the key into the lock of locker number 666, and opened it. There was no sign of\
  \ my harness, my rope, and my cotton wool. Instead, what I found in the locker was\
  \ the thing that, had I but known, I would have dropped as surely as one drops a\
  \ burning potato, for it led to my utter ruin in this world, and my damnation in\
  \ the world to come.\n\nTerry-Thomas, for younger readers who may not know what\
  \ a postwar cad looked like\n[2014-03-24]"
