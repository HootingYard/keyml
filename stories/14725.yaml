text: "One of my favourite Hooting Yard characters is Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb.\
  \ He made his first appearance long ago in the last century, in The Immense Duckpond\
  \ Pamphlet:\nThe next day all hell broke loose. Early in the morning, as Blodgett\
  \ polished the outside spigots, an ogre or wild man hove into view atop the southern\
  \ hills. Its progress towards the House was implacable. It stamped through the bracken,\
  \ vaulted the ha-ha with a single bound, negotiated the massive basalt wall with\
  \ surprising elegance, and sprang towards the terrified Blodgett, whirling its hirsute\
  \ arms alarmingly and making disgusting guttural noises. It was matted with filth.\
  \ Flies, gnats, and tiny things emitting poisonous goo crawled all over its flesh.\
  \ It seemed to be decomposing. It drooled. It picked up Blodgett, sank its fangs\
  \ into his skull, and hurled him aside. Pausing momentarily to spit out particles\
  \ of Blodgett's head, it smashed its way through the wall of the House, oblivious\
  \ to the fact that there was an ajar door three feet to its right. Once inside the\
  \ House, its rage seemed to increase. It rushed wildly from room to room, obliterating\
  \ the furniture, tearing up floorboards, destroying chandeliers, bashing holes into\
  \ walls and ceilings, sucking the wallpaper off the walls. It chewed up banister\
  \ rails and regurgitated them, disgorging them with such force that each rail acted\
  \ as a lethal projectile. At least one of the urchins was impaled as a result. Five\
  \ minutes after the ogre's arrival much of the lower part of the House lay in ruins.\
  \ Small fires were starting, but they were doused by water spurting from uprooted\
  \ taps. Euwige and Jubble were still sprawled in the Bittern Room when the ogre\
  \ eventually came upon them. It let out an inhuman cry. It picked at its sores.\
  \ It became becalmed. Fixing it with a bemused stare, Jubble rose to his feet. \u201C\
  You know, there might still be some grog left,\u201D he said, \u201CWould you care\
  \ for a drop?\u201D The ogre pounded its fists against its own head. Then it blinked,\
  \ shuddered, twitched. Jubble pushed a tin mug of grog into its paw. It gulped the\
  \ sweet muck down greedily, then threw the mug back at Jubble, missing his ear by\
  \ a whisker, as they say. Something in its manner seemed to change. By now, blind\
  \ Euwige too was on her feet. She sniffed at the violent pongs emanating from the\
  \ ogre, then stepped towards it. \u201CThank heaven! You have come!\u201D she said,\
  \ \u201CJubble, meet my dear friend Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb! He comes from\
  \ a far country, and his brain is hot.\u201D\n[2016-06-15]"
