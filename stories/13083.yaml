text: "Oi!, writes Tim Thurn again, this time without even the small courtesy of addressing\
  \ me by name, Not only do you neglect to issue warnings about bat-gods, but now\
  \ you are making wild and unhinged assumptions about your readers, or at least about\
  \ me. The other day you had the gall to \u201Creassure\u201D me regarding the bat-god\
  \ Slosher by pointing out that he is only ever seen in the vicinity of marshes,\
  \ \u201Cwhere he\u2014[i.e., me]\u2014 is unlikely to practise his picnicking\u201D\
  . And what do you know of my picnicking proclivities, eh?\nAs it happens I often\
  \ go a-picnicking at a particularly dreadful and eerie marsh, out beyond the Blister\
  \ Lane Bypass and the Grimpen Mire mosh pit. Incidentally, if you ever feel compelled\
  \ to disport and cavort with spastic exuberance, in mud, I wholeheartedly recommend\
  \ this mosh pit. I am told by the OED that spastic may cause offence, but that is\
  \ not my intention. I am using the word merely to indicate the kind of uncoordinated\
  \ flailing about with which persons commonly comport themselves in mosh pits\u2014\
  at least, the persons and mosh pits of my acquaintance, of which there are oodles.\n\
  Just because I mentioned my picnic praxis of hoisting a placard and sounding a picnic-klaxon\
  \ upon entering a field upon a picnic bent, that is not to say that a field is my\
  \ exclusive choice of picnic spot. Far from it. There is an old \u201Cpop\u201D\
  \ number called something like Wherever I Lay My Hat, That's My Home. Some years\
  \ ago I wrote a frankly autobiographical version, retitled Wherever I Lay My Picnic\
  \ Blanket, That's My Picnic Spot. Over several verses I described some memorable\
  \ past picnics in a variety of settings, including a field, the aforementioned dreadful\
  \ and eerie marsh, a buttercup-splattered meadow, bosky hillsides, mountaintops,\
  \ shores of lake and sea, haunts of coot and hern, multi-storey carparks, aerodrome\
  \ hangars, the Blister Lane Bypass, the mosh pit at Grimpen Mire, Loopy Copse, the\
  \ occasional pier and jetty, a bus shelter in Plovdiv, and the inside of my own\
  \ head. That last one was a dream-picnic, ruined by a swarm of hornets.\nI was so\
  \ pleased with my song that I cobbled together a band to perform it and booked time\
  \ in a recording studio. Interestingly, this was the first time my glockenspielist,\
  \ Midge Ure, had ever set foot in a studio. At least I think he said his name was\
  \ Midge Ure, though I may have misheard him. We pressed several hundred copies of\
  \ the \u201Cwaxing\u201D, in coloured vinyl, and I still have most of them in a\
  \ cardboard box under a spare picnic blanket in a cupboard.\nPlease let me know\
  \ if you would like me to write a series of lengthy guest postages for you. I could\
  \ cover all aspects of the infinitely intriguing world o\u2019 picnics, in exhaustive\
  \ detail. And I can promise you now there would be no mention of Slosher! (fingers\
  \ crossed).\nYours picnicly, Tim Thurn\n[2014-08-23]"
