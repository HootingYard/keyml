text: "The first one ashore was Captain Miles Coverdale, a man all too aware that\
  \ he shared his name with the first translator of the Bible into English.\nThe second\
  \ man ashore was Corporal William Tyndale, who had absolutely no idea that he shared\
  \ his name with the first man to translate the Bible into English from the original\
  \ Greek and Hebrew.\nThe third ashore was Cornet James Version, known to all and\
  \ sundry as\u201CKing\u201D James Version.\nAs dawn broke, the Captain, the Corporal\
  \ and the Cornet stood, panting and brine-drenched, on the glittering sands. They\
  \ took their firearms from the rubber sacks in which they had carried them ashore,\
  \ and cocked them. Yonder, in the trees and bushes, savages could be lurking. This\
  \ was an uncharted land, the first they had spotted from the periscope of their\
  \ submarine in all their months at sea, months that would turn to years, for the\
  \ submarine was on a five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out\
  \ new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no submarine manned by a Captain\
  \ and a Corporal and a Cornet had gone before.\nThere was a sudden rustling in the\
  \ trees and bushes beyond the shoreline sands. Instinctively, Captain Miles Coverdale\
  \ aimed his ray gun and fired. It was his way, to shoot at the first sign of movement\
  \ and worry about the consequences later. That was why he was the Captain. As the\
  \ foliage burst into flames, he pranced forward, taking further blasts, signalling\
  \ for the Corporal and the Cornet to follow him.\nAbove, in the sky, birds shrieked.\n\
  Just before they reached the burning trees and bushes, a figure stepped out to confront\
  \ them, a figure unlike any they had seen before. It was indubitably a man, but\
  \ what manner of man? His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries\
  \ beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly\
  \ whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery\
  \ eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which\
  \ they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. The Captain\
  \ was in no doubt.\n\u201CWatch out, men!\u201D, he cried, \u201CThis is one of\
  \ those savages I warned you about!\u201D\n\u201CShall we kill it immediately, in\
  \ cold blood?\u201D asked the Corporal.\n\u201CWait, I think it is about to grunt\
  \ some unholy savage babbling,\u201D said the Cornet.\nAnd indeed, the strange figure\
  \ held up a hand as if in greeting, and shook charred leaves and twigs from its\
  \ hair, and its watery eyes fixed the trio of submariners in a mesmeric gaze. Its\
  \ voice, when at last it spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression\
  \ and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\n\u201CBibite unusquisque aquam\
  \ cisternae suae donec veniam et tollam vos,\u201D it said.\n\u201CCrikey! What\
  \ was all that about?\u201D asked the Corporal.\n\u201CIf I am not mistaken,\u201D\
  \ said the Captain, \u201CIt is speaking Latin. It said something along the lines\
  \ of \u2018Drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take\
  \ you away\u2019\u201D.\n\u201CActually,\u201D said Cornet \u201CKing\u201D James\
  \ Version, \u201CNow you mention it, I am quite thirsty. Permission to glug from\
  \ my cistern, Captain?\u201D\nCaptain Miles Coverdale assessed the situation in\
  \ a twinkling, as he had been trained to do back at Captaincy Training School. While\
  \ keeping a beady eye on the savage, he commanded his men to take the cisterns from\
  \ their satchels and to glug away. Mid-glug, the Cornet had a sudden thought, and\
  \ piped up.\n\u201CCaptain,\u201D he said, \u201CThe savage said that when we had\
  \ drunk each from his own cistern he was going to take us away. Where do you think\
  \ he's going to take us to?\u201D\nBut even as he spoke, the savage came lumbering\
  \ forward, and it swept the three of them up, and it carried them off into the trees\
  \ and the bushes, they were swept away, they were swept away and gone. Birds continued\
  \ to shriek in the sky, and the glittering sands were again deserted as before,\
  \ and just offshore the submarine lay bobbing on the water, and waves crashed over\
  \ it, and as the years passed it rusted and broke in pieces and one by one the pieces\
  \ sank to the bottom of the sea, and became nooks for crabs and lobsters and other\
  \ beings of the deep, and no trace was ever found of the Captain and the Corporal\
  \ and the Cornet.\n[2011-11-23]"
