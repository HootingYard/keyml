text: "A vulture was hacking at my feet. I punched it in the throat and it flew away,\
  \ up to a corner of the cage, where it perched, furious. I was furious too. I let\
  \ myself out of the cage, clanging the door behind me, and went straight to the\
  \ bandagerie. It was shut, which made me more furious. I took a plum from my pocket,\
  \ ate it quickly, and threw the stone at a whinchat. I missed, but the act of throwing\
  \ calmed me down.\nLeaving a trail of blood from the wounds in my feet, I crossed\
  \ the site to my cabin. I was about to go in when the hooter hooted, deafeningly.\
  \ We are trained to stand absolutely still, chin up, hyper-alert, all wax removed\
  \ from our ears, to await whatever announcement\u2014or command, or diktat, or ukase\u2014\
  will follow. When at last the sound of the hooter died, I heard the grating voice\
  \ of Grandma Pipstraw ordering me\u2014me!\u2014to report immediately to her at\
  \ the k\xF6zpont. It was the first time I had ever heard my name spoken aloud by\
  \ Grandma Pipstraw, and I felt a curious admixture of pride and terror.\nI sprinted\
  \ to the k\xF6zpont as fast as my vulture-hacked feet would allow. The security\
  \ git scanned the identity number tattooed on the side of my neck, and shoved me\
  \ along a passageway to the inmost hub. Grandma Pipstraw was sitting on her musnud,\
  \ knitting. She looked up at me, and I saw reproach in her half-blind eyes.\n\u201C\
  We have CCTV footage of you punching Geraldine the vulture in the throat,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201CWhat have you got to say for yourself? Actually, don't answer\
  \ that. You will only whine, and I can't stand whining. So a vulture hacks at your\
  \ feet? What do you expect? Birds are savage, wild creatures. A woodpecker will\
  \ peck you, if you are made of wood. A swan can break your arm, according to Tim\
  \ Henman. A vulture will hack at your feet. Deal with it. But you do not punch Geraldine\
  \ in the throat. You're fired. The security git will escort you, roughly, off the\
  \ premises. Now, begone from my half-blind sight!\u201D\nAnd that is how I lost\
  \ my job as an Aviary Assistant at Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo.\nUnemployed, penniless,\
  \ and hopeless, I wandered from seaside resort to seaside resort, jostling with\
  \ seagulls as we scavenged for scraps. Then one night, when the seagulls were asleep,\
  \ I was rummaging in a municipal seaside dustbin and I found a discarded copy of\
  \ Dobson's pamphlet Things To Do When You Have Been Dismissed From Your Job At A\
  \ Zoo (out of print). I wondered what qualified the twentieth century's greatest\
  \ pamphleteer to expound on the subject. As far as I was aware, Dobson had never\
  \ been employed by a zoo in any capacity. So I approached his text with a measure\
  \ of caution.\nI was bowled over. The prose was hysterical and jarring, but Dobson\
  \ really seemed to know what he was talking about. Over forty closely-typed pages,\
  \ he suggested two \u201Cthings to do\u201D for somebody in my predicament. I can't\
  \ remember the first one, possibly because I did not understand it, but the second\
  \ suggestion was absolutely brilliant. I will not quote the pamphleteer directly,\
  \ on legal advice, but the gist of it was \u201Crun away and join a circus\u201D\
  .\nI tossed the pamphlet back into the dustbin and I ran away, oh how I ran!\nSome\
  \ weeks later, I eventually arrived, panting, at a Big Top pitched in a mud-stricken\
  \ field on the outskirts of Pointy Town. While running, I had had plenty of time\
  \ to devise a circus act which, I was sure, would see me welcomed with open arms.\
  \ Before going into the tent, I brushed my hair and removed all the wax from my\
  \ ears. Then I pranced through the tent-flap and presented myself before the circus\
  \ ringmaster, who went by the name Baruch Spinoza.\n\u201CHello!\u201D I chirped,\
  \ \u201CI would like to join your circus!\u201D\n\u201CI see,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  Who are you and what is your circus act?\u201D\n\u201CI am Little Minnie Pipstraw,\
  \ The Amazing Vulture-Puncher,\u201D I said, \u201CI punch vultures in the throat\u201D\
  .\n\u201CThat sounds highly entertaining,\u201D said the ringmaster, \u201CYou're\
  \ hired\u201D.\nI would like to say that I was an instant success at Baruch Spinoza's\
  \ Big Top, but in truth it took several years to perfect my act. Initially, I had\
  \ a great deal of difficulty finding an available vulture, and had to make do with\
  \ a toy one made of marzipan. My punching technique, with my dainty little fist,\
  \ won the crowds over, and when I upgraded to a papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 vulture, the\
  \ applause was thunderous.\nIt so happened that one muggy summer's day, we pitched\
  \ our circus tent in a mud-stricken field slap bang next to Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely\
  \ Zoo. I could not resist paying a visit. Though years had passed, the same security\
  \ git stood on guard at the gate. He did not recognise me. When I tried to enter,\
  \ he stopped me.\n\u201CThe zoo is shut,\u201D he said, \u201CGrandma Pipstraw passed\
  \ beyond this mortal realm last week. She became hopelessly entangled in the ravels\
  \ of wool she was knitting, with fatal results. We shall not see her like again.\
  \ To pay her funeral costs, we are selling off the zoo animals and aviary birds\
  \ at bargain bin prices. Can I interest you in anything?\u201D\nOf course, I jumped\
  \ at the chance to buy a real live vulture for 35p. I took it back to the Big Top,\
  \ happier I think than I had ever been. Goodbye marzipan and papier-m\xE2ch\xE9\
  ! From this day on Little Minnie Pipstraw, The Amazing Vulture-Puncher really would\
  \ be amazing!\nBut in my glee and excitement, there was one thing I had not accounted\
  \ for. It is a signal fact, at least in this work, that vultures have a sort of\
  \ hereditary memory, passed down from parents to hatchlings. Thus, a hurt inflicted\
  \ on a vulture will be \u201Cremembered\u201D by that vulture's offspring, and their\
  \ offspring, and their offspring, yea unto every generation. And Dennis, my bargain\
  \ bin 35p vulture, was a direct descendant of Geraldine.\nThat night, in the Big\
  \ Top, I pranced into the ring with Dennis by my side. As the crowd gawped, I punched\
  \ him in the throat with my dainty fist. He flew away, up into a corner of the tent,\
  \ where he perched on a tall circus pole. And there came swimming into his vulture-brain\
  \ the inherited memory of his great-great-grandmother, Geraldine, also punched in\
  \ the throat, years ago, by Little Minnie Pipstraw, whose feet she was hacking,\
  \ as any vulture would hack. Dennis was furious. He fixed his vulture-gaze on me,\
  \ standing in the ring below accepting the wild applause of the circus crowd, and\
  \ he swooped. He descended upon me at dazzling speed, and plunged his beak down\
  \ my throat, a vulture avenged. Falling back, I was relieved to feel him drowning\
  \ irretrievably in my blood, which was filling every depth, flooding every shore.\n\
  The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Tania and James\
  \ Stern. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-03-03]"
