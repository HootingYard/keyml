text: 'Like the leaf clings to the tree, oh! my darling cling to me, for we are like
  creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind! Wild is the wind! Wild it is! As wild
  as the wind in The Wind starring Lillian Gish. This wild wind howls across the desolate
  tarputa, so you must cling to me, my darling, and I must cling to these railings,
  and our clingings, yours to me and mine to the railings, will prevent us being blown
  away, like specks of dust in the wild wind.

  I cling to the railings surrounding the huge cement hollyhock that is the only landmark
  for miles and miles across the desolate tarputa. It is the work of the noted cement
  hollyhockist Sidney Hock, though the railings are municipal. When unveiled, so many
  moons ago, it was painted, all green and pink and crimson, with emulsion, but the
  relentless wild wind has stripped it of its paint and now it is a bare cement hollyhock
  towering on the tarputa, a handy landmark where such as we can arrange our assignations.
  For we are like creatures of the wind.

  Sidney Hock placed other cement hollyhocks in other locations, but this one is his
  masterpiece. That is why it is protected by railings. They are stout and strong,
  the railings, the better to withstand the wild wind. I cling to them now, as you
  cling to me, as the wind roars. We cannot hear each other speak, but what use is
  speech?

  The cement hollyhockist was himself a mute, by dint of some unfathomable hysteric
  blot upon his brain. From the age of ten, after a picnic, not a word was heard from
  his mouth. He had a great feeling for the tarputa, for its desolation, for the wild
  wind that roars across it, flattening everything except the enormous cement hollyhock
  which looms above us as we cling. Here we can conduct our assignations safe from
  the prim and priggish villagers in their broad-brimmed hats and black frock-coats.
  We shall not skulk in alleyways and shadow. Out here on the tarputa, in the howling
  wind, we cling, me to the railings and you to me, like the leaf clings to the tree.
