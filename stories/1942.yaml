text: "I sat bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night and realised that I am\
  \ dissatisfied with the word \u201Cpost\u201D to describe an individual blog entry.\
  \ Henceforth, at Hooting Yard, what was once a \u201Cpost\u201D will be known as\
  \ a \u201Cpostage\u201D. That, by way of preamble to this:\nIn a comment on yesterday's\
  \ Gubbinsy postage, Georgy Riecke wrote: Punchy, Zippy, Bangy, Crashy\u2014aren't\
  \ they the names of characters from the infamous Belgian kid's TV show \u2018War\
  \ Zone\u2019? A mean-spirited bunch, make no bones about it, but they're embarrassingly\
  \ photogenic and would sell a corpse for a bride if you paid them in jellybeans.\
  \ Mr Riecke is almost, but not quite, correct. Punchy & co are indeed characters\
  \ from a Belgian television programme, ostensibly designed for children, but it\
  \ is not called \u201CWar Zone\u201D and they are not mean-spirited. The adjective\
  \ that best suits these characters is, I think, \u201Cbewildering\u201D.\nPunchy\
  \ is an intricately-constructed puppet of wire and cardboard and straw and sandpaper\
  \ and tin foil and rubber bands. Zippy is a tea strainer the handle of which has\
  \ been punched through the top of a bag of icing sugar. Bangy is a rag. Not a rag\
  \ doll, merely a rag, and a singularly grubby one at that. Crashy is a piece of\
  \ special effects digital wizardry and takes one's breath away, if one is the sort\
  \ of person to have one's breath taken away by special effects digital wizardry.\
  \ Not all of us are. Some of us are more likely to be breathtaken by, oh, I don't\
  \ know, the unbridled energy of Boswell's London Journal, or, in a different register,\
  \ the sixteen Revelations Of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich.\nCertainly Julian's\
  \ classic text inspired Gus Van Der Vim, the creator of Punchy and Zippy and Bangy\
  \ and Crashy. In fact the entire series of shows, screened between 1972 and 1976,\
  \ is a thickly-disguised adaptation of the first Revelation, the one with the hazelnut.\
  \ Although none of our bewildering quartet resembles a squirrel visually, there\
  \ is something of the squirrel in the personality of Punchy, if a puppet can be\
  \ said to have a personality as such. Perhaps what it has is, rather, a puppetality.\
  \ That being so, it allowed Van Der Vim to express his frankly hysterical response\
  \ to the First Divine Revelation in the form of a weird, knockabout, psychedelic,\
  \ baffling, and occasionally creepy children's television programme, in which pursuit\
  \ of a hazelnut is the starting point of each show.\nThe fact that the programme\
  \ was cancelled by Belgian television executives in 1976 has led many soi disant\
  \ cultural commentators to argue that it was a victim of punk's Year Zero. Jon Savage\
  \ and others, who have forged careers based on their real or counterfeit presence\
  \ at early Sex Pistols gigs, like to claim that Gus Van Der Vim was ousted from\
  \ Flemish children's television because he had long hair and wore Lennonite granny\
  \ glasses. The truth, as ever, is more mundane, but what it is, that shining truth,\
  \ is clouded in the mystical mists of which Julian of Norwich gave us such a majestic\
  \ account, an account which gives due prominence, in the First Revelation at least,\
  \ to the hazelnut.\n\_\n[2009-02-28]"
