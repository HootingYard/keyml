text: "Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, was an intermittent diarist. At certain\
  \ periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal.\
  \ At other times he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings, and there are\
  \ also whole stretches where he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist. Surprisingly,\
  \ there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant texts into a published\
  \ edition. Here, however, is Dobson's diary entry written sixty years ago to the\
  \ day, on the first of January 1953:\nCabbage stalks in swans\u2019 blood for breakfast.\
  \ Then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. Stopped to\
  \ gaze at cows\u2014the cows gazed back. Spent untold hours slumped at my escritoire\
  \ struggling with my pamphlet in progress, Farming With Gnomes. The problem is I\
  \ know little about farming and even less about gnomes. Why, then, asked my inamorata\
  \ Marigold Chew, did I choose the topic in the first place? She fails to grasp the\
  \ intricate workings of what I have decided to dub \u201CDobson Praxis\u201D, a\
  \ praxis that itself may be the subject of a future pamphlet.\nWhen the time came\
  \ to sharpen my pencil I could not find the pencil sharpener, so instead I picked\
  \ up this week's copy of The Listener and read a fascinating article about a buff-breasted\
  \ sandpiper. From a careful reading\u2014and rereading\u2014I deduced that this\
  \ is some sort of bird, though what it is doing hanging around at a sewage works\
  \ is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight I am by no means certain\
  \ that I would choose to wallow in sewage when I could take wing and fly to, oh\
  \ I don't know, somewhere less noisome and noxious.\nActually, I note that the writer\
  \ calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable\
  \ type of farm for gnomes. I shall have to embark upon further research.\nPig innards\
  \ and peas for supper.\n\n[2013-01-01]"
