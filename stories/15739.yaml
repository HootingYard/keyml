text: "Another thing I found in my recent rummage was a small batch of cuttings from\
  \ the legendary Factsheet Five magazine. Indefatigable editor Mike Gunderloy was\
  \ a generous reviewer of my (now) out of print Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets\
  \ and books. Here are some of his observations:\n\nHouse Of Turps. A curious and\
  \ delightful little booklet. Key writes in a sort of manic academic style, tracing\
  \ the life of the obscure chemist-chieftain Slobodan Curpin as he staggers through\
  \ the early days of the scientific revolution. Experimental windsocks, poultice-making,\
  \ and a civilisation beneath the Arctic ice all make perfect sense here. Much better\
  \ than the usual dreary textbook treatment of this sort of thing. Maddeningly sensible\
  \ and discordant at the same time.\nThe Immense Duckpond Pamphlet. More bizarre\
  \ prose from the fevered mind of Frank Key. This is a sort of murder mystery, replete\
  \ with an ogre who proves to be a detective, soup recipes, signs from bizarre pubs,\
  \ potato science, and even duckponds. Frank has a style all his own, which most\
  \ of us could not approach even with the use of large quantities of illicit drugs.\n\
  Twitching And Shattered. This is a collection of many of Frank's shorter works,\
  \ including the infamous \u201CTales of Hoon\u201D and his series of dustjackets\
  \ for forthcoming books. It also contains the wildly funny \u201CSome Lesser-Known\
  \ Editions Of The Bible\u201D, an exercise in parodied scholarship that had me rolling\
  \ on the floor. I like Frank's writing quite a bit. He has a perfectly deadpan style\
  \ that can string together the most utter nonsense and make it fascinating. Personally,\
  \ I find this style delicious, whether Frank is writing of mysterious foreign agents,\
  \ trips to Iceland, or bicycles and earwigs. If you're fond of relatively sophisticated\
  \ and curious humour, you too should own a copy.\nAh, those were the small press\
  \ days, in the pre-www world. Now you get the outpourings of my allegedly \u201C\
  fevered mind\u201D absolutely free, on an almost daily basis. That being so, remember\
  \ you can always send a donation by hitting that Paypal link over to your right\
