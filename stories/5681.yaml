text: "In three days\u2019 time, the Hooting Yard website will be seven years old,\
  \ and I am disconcerted, on trawling back through the archives, to note that every\
  \ Yuletide season has passed without the appearance of what one would have thought\
  \ was essential, a Hooting Yard Christmas Gift Guide. God alone knows how you lot\
  \ have coped! Anyway, following an exclusive commercial tie-in with the most gorgeous\
  \ department store in the known universe, Hubermann's, I can now rectify this terrible\
  \ omission. Here, then, are five superlative gifts, available at bargain bin prices\
  \ from a bin outside the bargain bin basement of Hubermann's \u201Cbeacon\u201D\
  \ store in Pointy Town.\nJumbo Sack O\u2019 Agricultural Waste Matter. The perfect\
  \ gift for the peasant in your life. A mind-numbingly gigantic burlap sack absolutely\
  \ cram-packed with noisome slurry and farm filth.\nWandering Mendicant's Collapsed\
  \ Lung, Preserved In Jelly. Surgically removed by top doctors from the corpse of\
  \ a wandering mendicant, this collapsed lung has been expertly preserved in special\
  \ jelly. Is what it says on the jar.\n\u201CTwo-In-One\u201D Marionette. Made from\
  \ old coathangers, rags, and solidified puff pastry, this fascinating puppet looks\
  \ just like Yoko Ono until you turn it round and tweak it a bit, when, voila! you\
  \ have a lifelike Bernard Cribbins doll! Hours of fun with two of your favourite\
  \ non-fiction characters. (Provide your own string.)\nGrow Your Own Marsh. Transform\
  \ your living room into an eerie marsh, complete with mephitic vapours, inexplicable\
  \ darting lights, and pipe-smoking marsh sprites. Simply sprinkle the contents of\
  \ the sachet on to your carpet and watch it dissolve, before sinking up to your\
  \ armpits and flailing hopelessly, just like Sabine Baring-Gould!\nThe Radiating\
  \ Lance Of Saint Poppo. If you have any Belgian Catholics in your family, they will\
  \ treasure this miniature plastic toy lance, radiating fire from heaven just like\
  \ the lance of Saint Poppo (977\u20131048), one of the first Flemish pilgrims to\
  \ the Holy Land.\n[2010-12-11]"
