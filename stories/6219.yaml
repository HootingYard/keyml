text: 'Mention of Dr Charlotte Bach''s tragically unrealised Aztec board game summoned
  to memory a family favourite from my childhood. Overseas Jesuit was a board game
  in which one rolled the dice and moved one''s counter across various dark and benighted
  continents, converting the heathen hordes by fire and sword. So simple were the
  rules that the game was suitable for even the tiniest young Catholic.
