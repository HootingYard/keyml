text: "Oh look! A letter has arrived in the post:\nDear Mr Key\_: I have long been\
  \ an avid reader of your witterings, but this is the first time I have felt compelled\
  \ to write to you. My name is Keith Potger. Last week, two days short of my eighty-first\
  \ birthday, I learned that I share my name with one of The Seekers, the Antipodean\
  \ folk/pop sensations of the 1960s, with whom you seem to be (over)familiar. I found\
  \ it surprising that nobody had ever pointed this out to me before, but there you\
  \ go, dimpus dempus, as they used to say, in Latin, or Dog Latin, or Pig Latin,\
  \ or one of the Latins, if memory serves, and it may not, given my advancing years.\n\
  The reason I am writing to you is born of concern. As I said, I have been reading\
  \ your stuff for a long time, and I have until now considered you perhaps the most\
  \ sensible writer on the planet, if not in the known universe. Many is the time\
  \ I have whacked my ancient mother on the head, to wake her from her stupor, just\
  \ so I could recite to her, yelling as loudly as possible into her ear-trumpet,\
  \ one of your matchless sentences, so full of wisdom and moral rigour.\nBut now,\
  \ I am sad to say, I fear you may be teetering on the delusional. You seem to think\
  \ that every civilised person knows the names of The Seekers. I pride myself on\
  \ being an incomparably civilised man, in spite of recent unfortunate piddle-stains\
  \ on my trousers, and until last week I did not know the names of any of them. It\
  \ is only because of the far-fetched coincidence that I share Keith Potger's name\
  \ that I now know one. And yet I am quite well-informed about 1960s pop sensations\
  \ in general, having committed to memory the Bernard Levin List. Indeed, when I\
  \ am not shouting your sentences at my ancient mother, I am shouting that list at\
  \ her, in short bursts, into her ear-trumpet, in an attempt to stimulate her catastrophically\
  \ fading brain-integuments.\nI am minded to observe, however, that should you persist\
  \ with the absurd fancy that everybody knows The Seekers, my mother appears a mental\
  \ colossus in comparison. This could be merely the top of a slippery slope for you,\
  \ Mr Key. I note that you also seem to believe that everybody can reel off the names\
  \ John, Paul, George, and Ringo (plus Yoko), barely without thinking. What in the\
  \ name of heaven are you blathering on about? John Paul\u2014without the comma in\
  \ between\u2014is the name of a pair of late twentieth-century pontiffs of the Holy\
  \ Apostolic Roman Catholic Church. As for the other three names, in that context\
  \ they are frankly incomprehensible, and you have obviously made two of them up.\
  \ I screamed all five names repeatedly into my mother's ear trumpet, and the dear\
  \ woman showed not a flicker of recognition. This, for me, is the acid test.\nSpeaking\
  \ of the ancient Mrs Potger, I must end this letter now to go and attend to her.\
  \ The cup affixed under her chin to collect her drool is almost full, so I must\
  \ empty it into the drool-vat in the pantry.\nPlease try to get a grip, Mr Key.\
  \ It will be a tragedy if you lose your marbles.\nEver yours,\nKeith Potger (not\
  \ a Seeker)\n[2017-07-21]"
