text: "\u201CThe problem is not the sheep. The problem is irresponsible shepherds.\u201D\
  \ Thus spake\u2014on the radio this morning\u2014a spokesman for the majestically-named\
  \ Irresponsible Shepherding Task Force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently, that rustic\
  \ paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities,\
  \ allow their sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.\nPersonally, I am not surprised\
  \ to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating. Sheep are highly neurasthenic\
  \ creatures who spend their entire lives in a state of fretfulness and nervous tension,\
  \ and as a result they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why, as has been\
  \ observed by several country persons, a sheep's ambition in life is to die.\n[2016-08-05]"
