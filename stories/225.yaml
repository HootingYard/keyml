text: "Mr Key is currently a-moanin\u2019 and a-groanin\u2019 and generally feeling\
  \ sorry for himself, laid low by a seemingly endless series of colds. Perhaps it\
  \ is the same one, punctuated by brief periods of what passes for being hale and\
  \ hearty in these parts. Anyway, to the accompaniment of much snuffling, here are\
  \ a couple of items from the papers that deserve preservation in the Hooting Yard\
  \ Crate O\u2019 Press Cuttings.\nFirst, this report was issued by the Associated\
  \ Press in Amsterdam: A Dutch newspaper said yesterday it had received anonymous\
  \ threats to kill several of its journalists if the paper published its annual herring\
  \ review. There is more, but I think that first sentence is sufficiently arresting.\
  \ Perhaps the journalists would be better engaged doing something uncontroversial,\
  \ such as publishing cartoons of \u201Cthe prophet\u201D Mohammed\u2026 so long\
  \ as they don't include one of him munching on a herring, of course.\nNext, the\
  \ new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, has this to\
  \ say, in today's Guardian: \u201CWhat's the trellis on which the plant can grow?\
  \ We create the trellis\u2026 but we need to make sure the trellis is not getting\
  \ in the way of people being excellent.\u201D Trellis metaphors are always to be\
  \ applauded, in all contexts, at all times, and this one is especially welcome,\
  \ for I feared the worst. Youthful Mr Purnell, in his past life at the BBC, was\
  \ a bright-eyed acolyte of the preposterous John Birt, a man who sees an arrow and\
  \ calls it a \u201Cdirectional pointing device\u201D.\nI am now going to go and\
  \ be excellent, unless my trellis is in the way.\n[2007-07-06]"
