text: "From his exile in a pompous land, reader Mike Jennings very kindly alerts me\
  \ to a newly published film studies textbook from the University of \xDClm:\n\n\
  The title translates as Oi Mate! Are You Looking For A Punch In The Face?\_: Horst\
  \ Gack and the Cinema of Belligerence. The first study dedicated to the visionary\
  \ director of \u201CGoats and Ogres: A Film from the Hillsides\u201D, \u201CRevenge\
  \ of the Pig\u201D and \u201CThe Fatal Duckpond\u201D. This thumping tome collects\
  \ together essays by some of the most incisive and rigorous minds of Teutonic academia.\
  \ Unfortunately all the contributors have chosen to remain anonymous following reports\
  \ that Horst Gack's mysterious wife and collaboratrix Primrose Dent is \u201Cnot\
  \ best pleased\u201D with the book. We know not why, but then she is an international\
  \ woman of mystery, so her motivations and manias are forever hidden from the public\
  \ gaze.\nWhat is most startling about the book is that it completely avoids the\
  \ sort of obfuscatory postmodernist verbal diarrhoea that besmirches so many academic\
  \ texts these days. The formidable German intellects who have turned their brainpower\
  \ towards the films of Horst Gack do so in prose so plain and simple it can be understood\
  \ by tiny tots. This passage, from an essay entitled \u201CThe Use Of Smudged Camera\
  \ Lenses In Revenge Of The Pig\u201C, is typical. It was translated for Hooting\
  \ Yard by our old pal Fatima Gilliblat:\n\u201CSee the pig. See the pig in black\
  \ and white. See the pig blurred. See the pig go from the sty to the barn. See the\
  \ clouds louring. See the rain falling. Hear Horst Gack cry \u201CCut!\u201D Hear\
  \ Primrose Dent cry \u201CNo, don't cut yet!\u201D Hear a kerfuffle. See the camera\
  \ fall off its tripod. Hear imprecations and threats. See Horst Gack stomp off to\
  \ lock himself in his trailer. See the pig emerge from the barn and roll in the\
  \ muck. See Primrose Dent channelling the spirit of Leni Riefenstahl. See the rain\
  \ continue to pour down relentlessly until darkness falls.\u201D\n[2010-04-25]"
