text: "The other day I was scuttling, as one does, across the floors of silent seas.\
  \ There is no light down there, and it was cold and very wet. But that's the bottom\
  \ of the sea for you. It's no picnic\u2014though I've had my fair share of picnics\
  \ in the cold and wet. I recall one particular childhood picnic where the lid was\
  \ left off the marmalade jar, and soon enough it contained half marmalade, half\
  \ rainwater. I was an inquisitive child. I screwed the lid back on the jar and shook\
  \ it, violently, until the two substances, the marmalade and the rainwater, were\
  \ mixed together.\nYears later, I wrote a book about this experiment, called Marmalade\
  \ And Rainwater. Some of you may know of it. It was a bestseller, and won several\
  \ prestigious awards, including the Prix Poubelle. With the money I received for\
  \ that, I was able to buy an Alpine chalet with its own private funicular railway.\n\
  Success prompted the idea that I could mine my memories of childhood picnics for\
  \ further books. I began work on a fictionalised account of one such picnic, provisionally\
  \ entitled Sausages And Wasps. But I couldn't make it work. After every few pages\
  \ I would grow exasperated and despairing, and scrunch up what I'd written and toss\
  \ it down a waste chute. I realised that I was temperamentally incapable of writing\
  \ about this picnic, even in the guise of fiction, because it had taken place on\
  \ a hot dry sunny day, whereas what spoke to my imagination was the cold wet picnic.\n\
  It seems, though, that readers prefer their literary picnics dry and sunny. My second\
  \ book, More Marmalade And Further Rainwater, was a complete flop, selling fewer\
  \ than a dozen copies and winning no prizes whatsoever. It did not take long before\
  \ I faced financial ruin, so I decided to sell up and move elsewhere. But I made\
  \ the foolish mistake of selling the funicular railway first. This meant I was unable\
  \ to go to and from the Alpine chalet without paying a hefty fare for each journey\
  \ to the new owners, a family of goatherds unparalleled in their rapacity.\nHow,\
  \ then, did I get from my high Alpine home to where I am now, lingering in the chambers\
  \ of the sea? Ah, that will be the subject of my next book, a non-picnic-based memwa.\
  \ I am taking my time over it. There will be time, there will be time for a hundred\
  \ visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea. And I shall spread\
  \ my toast with a mixture of marmalade and rainwater.\n[2017-08-11]"
