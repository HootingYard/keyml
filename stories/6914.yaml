text: "On May 13 1988 I was amused to read a report in The Daily Telegraph that the\
  \ Royal Society for the Protection of Birds had erected a mesh fence to keep bird-fanciers\
  \ away from a colony of little terns on Great Yarmouth beach, whose numbers had\
  \ grown from 20 pairs to 70 pairs in three years.\nOn August 2 1990 I was interested\
  \ to read a report in The Daily Telegraph as follows:\n\u201CBritain's biggest breeding\
  \ colony of little terns, on Great Yarmouth Beach, Norfolk, where 201 pairs were\
  \ nesting, has been largely wiped out by two hedgehogs and a kestrel.\u201D\nKestrels,\
  \ of course, are fanatically protected by all the high-tech and paramilitary resources\
  \ of the multi-million pound RSPB, which on this occasion seems to have been hoist\
  \ with its own petard, as they say. It is hard to know with whom we should sympathise\
  \ most in this tale: the ordinary bird-fanciers, who were kept away from fancying\
  \ little terns by a mesh fence put up by the superior bird-fanciers of the RSPB\
  \ bureaucracy, or the unfortunate little terns, condemned to twitter away unseen.\n\
  My own sympathies are with the hedgehogs. They are delightful, if slightly flea-ridden,\
  \ animals, with whom it is sometimes possible to hold an intelligent conversation.\
  \ Has anybody ever had an intelligent conversation with a little tern? Hedgehogs\
  \ do not demand a whole apparatus of repression to survive. Every time a hedgehog\
  \ wipes out a little tern, it is a blow for freedom.\nAuberon Waugh, \u201CNature\
