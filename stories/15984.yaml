  \ Maddin. Here at Hooting Yard, we revere Maddin, the finest living film director\
  \ and a true original. Many of his short films are available on YouTube, and you\
  \ are urged to go and watch them at once. His feature films make pretty much everything\
  \ else in the cinema look impossibly dull and formulaic. Maddin is prolific\u2014\
  I could quite easily have chosen twenty-five different intertitles for this calendar.\
  \ Perhaps next year \u2026\nToday's intertitle is from Odin's Shield Maiden (2006).\n\
