text: "Spigot Boy was the eponymous hero of a cartoon strip that ran in the children's\
  \ comic The Ipsy Dipsy Doo during the early 1950s. Each week, Spigot Boy's adventures\
  \ stuck to a rigid formula. The strip consisted of just four panels, in the course\
  \ of which the tousle-haired nipper would happen upon an imminent act of civic malfeasance\
  \ which he would then foil by disguising himself as a spigot. Given these limitations,\
  \ there was, in each episode, a bewildering fecundity of invention.\nThough it no\
  \ doubt went over the heads of the infant readership, one of the great pleasures\
  \ of the Spigot Boy strip was that in each episode, at least one of the speech bubbles\
  \ would contain a direct quotation from the works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Almost\
  \ always, the words chosen seemed to fit seamlessly, with no sense that they had\
  \ been shoehorned in. Occasionally, of course, adherence to the formula meant there\
  \ was a rather forced, gratuitous quality to the Hopkins quotation, but even when\
  \ that did happen the strip was saved by, for example, the inclusion of a startlingly-executed\
  \ picture of a wheatear or a nuthatch in the sky just above and to the left of Spigot\
  \ Boy's head in the moments before he adopted his spigot disguise and foiled the\
  \ schemes of that week's civic malefactor.\nThe strip was discontinued after the\
  \ editrix of The Ipsy Dipsy Doo realised that the villains in each episode were\
  \ in fact crude caricatures of some of the leading professional foopballers of the\
  \ day, many of whom were called either Wally or Nat. One seldom meets with top flight\
  \ professionals named Wally or Nat in the game nowadays, which is a great pity.\n\
  But thereagain, one seldom meets with a tousle-haired nipper, fictional or otherwise,\
  \ who can expertly disguise himself as a fully-functioning spigot at the drop of\
  \ a hat. That, I think, is a greater pity. And I should know, because I know more\
  \ about pity than anybody. Pity, putty, and putti\u2014those are my areas of expertise,\
  \ and you would do well to remember that, for when I am crossed my rages are terrible,\
  \ not unlike those of a 1950s infant whose copy of The Ipsy Dipsy Doo has been snatched\
  \ from his tiny little hands and cast into the fire, where it is consumed by flames\
  \ more terrible than the flames of the deepest pit of hell.\n[2016-01-03]"
