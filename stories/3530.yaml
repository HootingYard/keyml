text: "I must apologise for echoing A A Milne in the title of this postage. (In 1928,\
  \ in her Constant Reader column in The New Yorker, Dorothy Parker wrote, immortally,\
  \ \u201Cand it is that word \u2018hummy\u2019, my darlings, that marks the first\
  \ place in The House at Pooh Corner at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up\u201D, thus\
  \ telling us all we ever need know about Milne.) But \u201Cnow we are six\u201D\
  \ is, in the present case, literally true, for it was on this day in 2003 that the\
  \ Hooting Yard website came into being.\nThere was, as aficionados know, an earlier\
  \ Hooting Yard presence on the interweb, but it was a static site containing a jumble\
  \ of pre-Wilderness Years odds and ends. On 14th\_December 2003, however, regular\
  \ postages from Mr Key's pea-sized yet pulsating brain began tumbling forth, and\
  \ continue to do so, with the occasional hiatus.\nMany thanks, on this anniversary,\
  \ to the readers and listeners who stalk the muddy lanes in and around Haemoglobin\
  \ Towers and Bodger's Spinney for your support and enthusiasm.\n[2009-12-14]"
