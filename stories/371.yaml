text: "Today is March 20th, and most right-thinking people will of course be celebrating\
  \ the anniversary of Yoko Ono's marriage to a whining, bespectacled Liverpudlian\
  \ pop singer, which took place back in 1969. But amid the carousing, let us not\
  \ forget that today is also the feast day of Saint Wulfram (circa 640\u2013703).\
  \ Wulfram is one of the few saints to share his name with a metallic element, in\
  \ his case a very hard, heavy, steel-gray to white transition metal also known as\
  \ tungsten. Pedants may point out that wolfram the metal is spelled with an O whereas\
  \ Wulfram the saint is spelled with a U, and they would be correct, but such orthographical\
  \ nit-picking, while valuable, need not concern us here.\nSaint Wulfram of Fontenelle,\
  \ whose life was recorded for us after his death by Jonas of Fontenelle, protects\
  \ those in danger upon the sea. In art, he is usually depicted in the act of baptising\
  \ a young king, or the son of King Radbod of Frisia. Radbod is not a name you come\
  \ across very often these days, which is a pity. I think I would be much more likely\
  \ to buy one of those magazines such as Heat or Hello or Pap if, on the cover, it\
  \ said \u201CInside\u2014Big News About Radbod!\u201D But I digress.\nThere are\
  \ some lines from The Saga Of King Olaf by the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\
  \ which are often recited by those of us who wish to commemorate Saint Wulfram,\
  \ or indeed to implore him for help if we are imperilled upon the sea, perhaps assailed\
  \ by howling gales on the poop deck as gigantic waves crash repeatedly against our\
  \ fragile ship. Longfellow wrote:\nTo the ship's bow he ascended, By his choristers\
  \ attended, Round him were the tapers lighted, And the sacred incense rose.\nOn\
  \ the bow stood Bishop Sigurd, In his robes as one transfigured, And the Crucifix\
  \ he planted\nI think we can all agree that such resonant words are more likely\
  \ to give us succour than the doggerel penned by Yoko Ono's late husband, mentioned\
  \ earlier.\nSo on this day, let us remember Saint Wulfram, and King Radbod too.\
  \ I sincerely hope that, if any new parents give birth to a baby boy on this special\
  \ day, they might see fit to call their child Wulfram, or Radbod, or both.\n[2008-03-20]"
