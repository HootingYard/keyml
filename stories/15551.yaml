text: "It is one of the enduring mysteries of contemporary life. How can it be, I\
  \ hear you cry, that there is not a blockbusting Hollywood franchise based on Hooting\
  \ Yard? Imagine for a moment that there existed a dimwitted action-packed film,\
  \ filled with CGI explosions and the like, in the spirit of, say, Alien vs. Predator,\
  \ but in this instance called Babinsky vs. The Grunty Man. Clearly the moviegoing\
  \ hordes would be queueing up at multiplexes across the land to lose themselves\
  \ for two and a half hours in such a spectacle. So why has Mr Key not yet had a\
  \ call from a Hollywood mogul? It is, as I say, an enduring mystery.\nI am sure,\
  \ too, that a film entitled Tiny Enid\_: Plucky Tot could spawn an endless string\
  \ of sequels. Come on, Hollywood! Get your act together!\nTo date, only the visionary\
  \ film-maker Miss HatHorn has used Hooting Yard as her source. If you have not yet\
  \ seen A Recipe For Gruel, watch it now.\n[2017-08-12]"
