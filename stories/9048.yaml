text: "Part One is here\_: now read on \u2026\nThe Paraffin Shed was the smallest\
  \ of a cluster of buildings, far from the railway itself but owned nevertheless\
  \ by the company, which charged pitiful rents to the tenants. Among the other buildings\
  \ were a tavern, an ink factory, a menagerie, a cork shop, an igloo, a massive,\
  \ empty prison, and a warehouse full of bones. The Paraffin Shed was rented by a\
  \ retired sea-captain, whose name is unfortunately not recorded. In later years,\
  \ Buttercase remembered him as by turns gruff and amiable, languid and crusty, corrosive\
  \ and vibrant, insensible and bereft. Although it may be thought that he spent long\
  \ hours entertaining his small visitor with seafaring yarns, tales of exploration\
  \ and derring-do upon the high seas, rattling narratives of piracy and bilgewater,\
  \ there is no evidence that he ever did so. As far as we know, all that ever took\
  \ place was that, upon Buttercase's arrival, the boy unhitched the tub from his\
  \ back, unscrewed the stopper, the sea-captain poured a paltry amount of paraffin\
  \ into it, demanded his money and held out his vast and hairy hand for receipt of\
  \ the coins, whereupon the lad paid him, replaced the stopper, hitched the refilled\
  \ tub on to his back, bid the old salt farewell until the morrow, and began the\
  \ long trudge back towards his parents\u2019 hut.\nDid he ever visit any of the\
  \ other buildings? He may have done. What would have happened had he encountered,\
  \ in the warehouse of bones, a slobbering giant wracked with the dropsy? Or blundered\
  \ into the menagerie and come face to face with a starving bison? Or been lured\
  \ into the ink factory and had his tub of paraffin stolen from him by the snag-toothed\
  \ serf detailed to stand guard at the door, his mouth forever filled with sticky,\
  \ raspberry-flavoured confections, the juice of which dribbled down his chin and\
  \ fell in droplets upon his outlandish pantaloons? What turn might have been taken\
  \ in the life of the cartographer-to-be had these things happened? There is rich\
  \ material here, but we must turn our backs upon it, and follow the young Buttercase\
  \ back to the rep-divided hut, to which, daily, he returns, as twilight descends\
  \ upon the land, and howls are heard far off in the distance, or perhaps the occasional\
  \ spurt of gunfire, or a hoot from the rickety train, trundling on its way, with\
  \ or without passengers, with or without freight.\nHe was sixteen years old when\
  \ he was flung into prison, and twenty when he was released on a special licence,\
  \ having been recommended by the prison governor to accompany an Antarctic expedition\
  \ as general factotum, accordionist, and toothbrush maker. Up to the very minute\
  \ the steamship Indescribable chugged out of the harbour, Buttercase was handcuffed\
  \ to a prison guard. The two had become fast friends during the seven-week journey\
  \ from the prison to the small seaside town from which the expedition sailed. Clump,\
  \ the guard, was a small, flickering man who drew maps in his spare time. Never\
  \ having set foot outside his homeland, his exquisitely illuminated maps of Far\
  \ Cathay, Beach, Zimpagu, Hoon, and Yssicol were the products of a fevered imagination\
  \ all too rare in men of his profession. Buttercase, of course, was awestruck. He\
  \ repeatedly badgered Clump to make him a gift of one of his maps, but the prison\
  \ guard refused for reasons we can only guess at. Not that we will bother.\nAs they\
  \ made their way on foot across the country for forty-nine days of that abominable\
  \ winter, Clump nevertheless gave Buttercase a far more valuable gift\u2014a pencil.\
  \ It must not be forgotten that in those days, convicted felons\u2014especially\
  \ those released on licence\u2014were routinely deprived of pencils, as they were\
  \ of pencil-sharpeners, pencil-cases, pens, protractors, rulers, compasses, crayons,\
  \ set-squares, and many other items of stationery and graphic equipment. The king\
  \ himself had renewed the ban in the very year of Buttercase's release. Clump was\
  \ taking a terrible risk. Perhaps he was in his cups when he hastily shoved the\
  \ pencil into Buttercase's pocket. The great cartographer later recalled that the\
  \ prison guard had tears in his eyes as he did so.\nOn the deck of the Indescribable,\
  \ Clump removed the handcuffs from his young charge's puny wrist. The two embraced.\
  \ Doughty explorers, some already kitted out in their Antarctic furs, bustled Clump\
  \ off the ship; they were impatient for Buttercase to begin his accordion lessons.\
  \ Prisoner and guard never saw each other again. Clump came to a bad end. On his\
  \ return to the prison, he had his pencils counted, and his furious blushes confirmed\
  \ the governor's suspicions. Dismissed from the service, he fell on evil days, and\
  \ died two years later, drunk out of his brain on the floor of a post office in\
  \ Tantarabim.\nTo be continued \u2026\n[NOTE\_: Clump is the first, but by no means\
  \ the last Hooting Yard character to meet his end drunk out of his brain on the\
  \ floor of a post office. The same fate befalls a music critic in The Phlogiston\
  \ Variations, I think, and quite possibly one or two others. This was also the first\
  \ appearance in my work of that realm of mystery known as Tantarabim.]\n[2012-05-02]"
