text: 'The other day I mentioned Gertrude Stein''s Tender Buttons. I feel it only
  right that you should be told Tender Buttons is also the name of a magnificent button
  shop in New York City. Last year it celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. Should
  you find yourself in that fair city I wholeheartedly recommend you pay it a visit
  and buy some buttons. I did.
