  \ could help avoid potential embarrassment when you have guests.\nAs he says,\n\
  wouldn't it be utterly awesome to keep a couple of owls in your bathroom, just to\
  \ impress visitors?\n\nMeanwhile, over at Wonders & Marvels, monkeys at war!\nWho\
  \ were the first monkeys to see action in war? Before the invention of gun powder\
  \ fire-arms in China (ca 13th century), a 9th century Chinese chronicle (\u201C\
  Yu-yang-tsah-tsu\u201D by Twan Ching-Shih) describes annual battles between soldiers\
  \ of Po-mi-lan and 300,000 giant rock-throwing apes who came down from the high\
  \ craggy mountains of the west to ravage crops every spring.\n[2012-05-06]"
