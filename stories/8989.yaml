text: "I am grateful to Glyn Webster for alerting me to the latest fiendish schemes\
  \ of the US Navy:\nthe lamprey's body contains a single wavelength of oscillation\
  \ at any given time, and thus always maintains an S-shape during swimming. Speed\
  \ is proportional to the frequency of this wave, and can vary by an order of magnitude.\
  \ Lampreys can even swim backward. Ayers is building an autonomous robotic lamprey\
  \ that can do the same thing.\nAyers is not new to this. He's been building robotic\
  \ lobsters for years, and he's basing his lamprey's technology on those\n\u201C\
  Now we're almost to the point where theoretically we could begin building whole\
  \ platoons of robotic lampreys and putting them on operational maneuvers in the\
  \ water,\u201D says Dr. Joel Davis, \u201CA robotic lamprey is ideal for stealthy\
  \ underwater search and identification missions.\u201D\n\n[2012-04-24]"
