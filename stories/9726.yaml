text: 'An eerie photograph arrives in the post from Salim Fadhley


  If you click to enlarge, you will see clearly that the name of this big ship is
  the Deutschland. Yet as we know, because Father Gerard Manley Hopkins SJ told us,
  the Deutschland was wrecked off the Kentish Knock on the morning of the seventh
  of December 1875. Five nuns were drowned! So could this be a ghost ship? And if
  we peer very very intently at the photo, can we see, there on deck, the Tall Nun?
  It is all very mysterious.
