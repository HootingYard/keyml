text: "There is a scene in the second series of Game Of Thrones where Daenarys Targaryen\
  \ and her raggle-taggle band of Dothraki followers, having struggled across the\
  \ vast and desolate Red Wastes, their food and water supplies exhausted, seek entrance\
  \ to the walled city of Qarth. They are met, outside the gates, by the Thirteen,\
  \ the ruling council, whose oleaginous spokesman refuses to let them enter. As the\
  \ Mother of Dragons points out, not unreasonably, this dooms them to certain death.\
  \ The spokesman is unmoved. How to resolve the impasse?\nAt this point, another\
  \ member of the Thirteen, who has been lurking at the back of the group, steps forward.\
  \ When his own arguments in favour of allowing the travellers in fail, he announces\
  \ \u201CI invoke Sumai!\u201D He then unsheathes his dagger and slices a nasty cut\
  \ in his own hand. Now the gates of Qarth are thrown open, and Daenarys and her\
  \ \u201CDothraki savages\u201D are ushered in, and saved.\nI was going to praise\
  \ writer George R. R. Martin for this touch of brilliance, until I learned\u2014\
  from one of the terrifyingly erudite websites devoted to the minutiae of the Game\
  \ Of Thrones universe\u2014that the scene is absent from the original books, and\
  \ was devised for the television series. No explanation is ever offered for Sumai,\
  \ or what precisely its invocation might mean in any other circumstances, and nobody\
  \ ever refers to it again. Yet I am lost in admiration for it as a narrative technique\
  \ to keep the story chugging along. I shall use it myself, and commend it to any\
  \ other writer who reaches a sticking point in their story. The bit with the dagger\
  \ and the blood can be modified, or left out entirely. But is there a single work\
  \ of fiction that could not be improved by having a character, at some point, declaiming\
  \ portentously \u201CI invoke Sumai!\u201D? I think not.\nI have prepared a supply\
  \ of slips of paper on which is typed \u201CI invoke Sumai!\u201D, said followed\
  \ by a blank space. I intend, shortly, to work my way systematically through the\
  \ volumes of fiction on the Key bookshelves, affixing with glue a slip at a point\
  \ in each book where the narrative threatens to get stuck in a cul de sac, and then\
  \ writing in an apt character name. The effect would be jarring if the phrase were\
  \ to be spoken invariably by rogue member of the Thirteen Xaro Xhoan Doxos. Far\
  \ better that it is put into the mouth of a character with whom we have grown familiar\
  \ in each particular novel, say for example Humbert Humbert or Elizabeth Bennett\
  \ or Josef K. or Bartleby the scrivener.\nInvoking Sumai may also come in handy\
  \ in real life. I am sure there are times, for example when you are leaning insouciantly\
  \ against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party, when the conversation\
  \ palls and you are lost for words. Now, all you need do to avert social discomfort\
  \ is to announce \u201CI invoke Sumai!\u201D. The ice will be broken, and stay broken,\
  \ if I am correct.\n\nXaro Xhoan Doxos invokes Sumai\n[2014-10-06]"
