text: 'Richard Carter of Gruts has kindly drawn my attention to this splendid passage
  from an autobiographical sketch by Thomas Henry Huxley:


  I was born about eight o''clock in the morning on the 4th of May, 1825, at Ealing,
  which was, at that time, as quiet a little country village as could be found within
  half a dozen miles of Hyde Park Corner. Now it is a suburb of London with, I believe,
  30,000 inhabitants. My father was one of the masters in a large semi-public school
  which at one time had a high reputation. I am not aware that any portents preceded
  my arrival in this world; but, in my childhood, I remember hearing a traditional
  account of the manner in which I lost the chance of an endowment of great practical
  value. The windows of my mother''s room were open, in consequence of the unusual
  warmth of the weather. For the same reason, probably, a neighbouring bee-hive had
  swarmed, and the new colony, pitching on the window-sill, was making its way into
  the room when the horrified nurse shut down the sash. If that well-meaning woman
  had only abstained from her ill-timed interference, the swarm might have settled
  on my lips, and I should have been endowed with that mellifluous eloquence which,
  in this country, leads far more surely than worth, capacity, or honest work, to
  the highest places in Church and State. But the opportunity was lost, and I have
  been obliged to content myself through life with saying what I mean in the plainest
  of plain language; than which, I suppose, there is no habit more ruinous to a man''s
  prospects of advancement.
