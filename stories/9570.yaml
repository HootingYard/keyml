text: "The Bisky Bat was first identified by Edward Lear in his poem The Quangle Wangle's\
  \ Hat (1877). It would be more accurate to say that it was only identified by Lear,\
  \ as nobody before or since seems to have had a word to say of its existence. Believe\
  \ me, I have done the research.\nThe initial problem I had to solve was whether\
  \ \u201CBisky\u201D was part of the formal nomenclature of this type of bat, or\
  \ whether Lear was referring to a generic bat, and applying a descriptive adjective.\
  \ The capitalisation of \u201CBisky\u201D would suggest the former, though \u201C\
  Bat\u201D is also capitalised in the text, so who knows? If \u201CBisky\u201D is\
  \ a general adjective, it is one that has been neglected by the OED and by all the\
  \ other standard dictionaries. There is a slim possibility that it may have something\
  \ to do with biscuits, but it is hard to understand what might be biscuit-like about\
  \ a bat. You might bake a biscuit in the shape of a bat, but that would be a Batty\
  \ Biscuit, not a Bisky Bat. I concluded, after much furrowing of the brow and smoking\
  \ quite a few gaspers, that \u201CBisky\u201D was indeed the formal name of a type\
  \ of bat.\nMy knowledge of the world o\u2019 bats is breathtaking. One of my party\
  \ pieces, which never fails to enliven even the most straitlaced and sober of social\
  \ gatherings, is to reel off in a dramatic tone of voice a list of bats. I rarely\
  \ need prompting, and I do not need prompting now. Some bats then: the Asian False\
  \ Vampire Bat, the Asian Painted Bat, the Big Brown Bat, the Big Free-tailed Bat,\
  \ the Brandt Bat, the Brazilian Free-tailed Bat, the Brown Long-eared Bat, the California\
  \ Leaf-nosed Bat,\_the Common Yellow-shouldered Bat, the Daubenton Bat, the Desert\
  \ Red Bat, the Eastern Long-eared Bat, the Eastern Pipistrelle, the Egyptian Fruit\
  \ Bat, the Evening Bat, the Florida Mastiff Bat, the Fringe-lipped Bat, Geoffroy's\
  \ Rayed Bat, the Giant Indian Fruit Bat, the Golden Horseshoe Bat, the Gray Bat,\
  \ the Greater Bulldog Bat, the Greater Horseshoe Bat, the Greater Long-nosed Bat,\
  \ the Greater Spear-nosed Bat, the Hoary Bat, the Honduran White Bat, the Indiana\
  \ Bat, the Ipanema Bat,\_Keen's Bat or the Northern Bat, the Lappet-browed Bat,\
  \ Leisler's Bat, the Lesser Horseshoe Bat, the Lesser Long-nosed Bat, Linnaeus\u2019\
  \ False Vampire Bat, the Little Brown Bat, the Long-nosed Bat, the\_Mexican Big-eared\
  \ Bat, the Mexican Fruit Bat, the Nathusius Pipistrelle, Natterer's Bat, the Noctule\
  \ Bat, the Northern Yellow Bat, the Pallid Bat, the Parti-coloured Bat, Peters\u2019\
  \ Ghost-faced Bat, Peters\u2019 Tent-making Bat, Peters\u2019 Wooly False Vampire\
  \ Bat, the Pipistrelle Bat, the Pocketed Free-tailed Bat, the Pygmy Pipistrelle,\
  \ Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, the Red Bat, Rodrigues\u2019 Fruit Bat, the\_Seminole\
  \ Bat, the Serotine Bat, the Short-tailed Fruit Bat, the Silver-haired Bat, the\
  \ Southeastern Bat, the Southern Yellow Bat, the Spotted Bat, the Straw-coloured\
  \ Fruit Bat, the Surat Serotine Bat,\_Townsend's Big-eared Bat, Underwood's Long-tongued\
  \ Bat, Underwood's Mastiff Bat, the Vampire Bat, the Western Mastiff Bat, the Whiskered\
  \ Bat, the Wrinkle-faced Bat, and the Yellow Bat. This is by no means an exhaustive\
  \ list. I have not mentioned, for example, the Demonic Tube-nosed Fruit Bat, Veldkamp's\
  \ Dwarf Epauletted Fruit Bat, St. Aignan's Trumpet-Eared Bat, the Strange Big-eared\
  \ Brown Bat, Schlieffen's Twilight Bat, the Tiny Yellow Bat, the Robust Yellow Bat,\
  \ the Equatorial Dog-faced Bat, the Coastal Tomb Bat, the Buffy Flower Bat, the\
  \ Hairy Little Fruit Bat, nor the various Smoky Bats. I could prattle on for hours,\
  \ and perhaps include a diversion where I pointed out the amusing fact that an entire\
  \ genus of fruit bats is known as the Dobsonia. But no matter how long my party\
  \ piece lasts, the one bat you will not hear mentioned is the Bisky Bat.\nNow this\
  \ is very odd. Edward Lear was a formidable naturalist, and he would hardly have\
  \ invented a bat. I can only assume that he spotted one, in 1877 or shortly beforehand,\
  \ named it, wrote of it, and then went on his merry way, no doubt assuming other\
  \ bat-mad persons would subject the bat to further study. And yet they did not.\n\
  Having reached a dead end in my researches, it occurred to me that I could make\
  \ profitable use of my time by attempting to draw a Bisky Bat. Now it has to be\
  \ said that I am a pretty cack-handed draughtsman, and not one of the hundreds of\
  \ bat drawings I have made in the past bears much resemblance to a bat. I always\
  \ have trouble with the wings and those little eyes and the complex radar-like navigation\
  \ system bats rely on to get from A to B. But on this occasion it would not be \u201C\
  me\u201D doing the drawing, for I resolved to enter into a trance and, with my arm\
  \ suspended, from the elbow, in a sling, and a pencil glued to my fingers, I would\
  \ commune with a spirit guide. This guide would control the movements of the pencil\
  \ across the paper. Before sinking into the trance, by means of mystic Blavatskyan\
  \ breathing exercises, gibberish, and a Brian Eno record, I went for a stroll and\
  \ a smoke and I wondered if the spirit that communed with me would be Edward Lear\
  \ himself, or perhaps another Victorian naturalist, one who had also spotted the\
  \ Bisky Bat but had failed to recognise it properly, and was now taking the opportunity\
  \ to make amends for his oversight. I would never know, of course, for when I emerge\
  \ from these trances, my brain is as if wiped clean with a particularly effective\
  \ disinfectant preparation.\nThe other thing that happens when I emerge from these\
  \ trances is that I am confronted with a sheet of paper on which I, or the medium,\
  \ has scribbled and scraped a formless mess of squiggly quangle wangle. I always\
  \ forget that, too.\nI have not quite abandoned my Bisky Bat research, however.\
  \ I am now working on the theory that the editors of the OED, and of all other standard\
  \ dictionaries, have somehow overlooked the word, and that it does indeed exist\
  \ as a common adjective. All I need do now is to work out what it means.\n[2012-07-04]"
