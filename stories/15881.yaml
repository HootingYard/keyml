text: "Dear Dr Fang, wrote Marigold Chew, I am writing to you, as the most eminent\
  \ brain-quack I can think of, to ask for your help. Dobson has gone doolally. Yesterday\
  \ he was as right as rain\u2014a curious phrase, I grant you, but let us not dwell\
  \ upon it\u2014sitting at his escritoire scribbling away, then trudging along the\
  \ towpath of the filthy old canal in the pouring rain, chucking pebbles at swans.\n\
  He remained reassuringly Dobson-like at breakfast this morning, tucking into a bowl\
  \ of boil-in-the-bag koala bear brains \u2018n\u2019 mashed plums and blathering\
  \ inconsequential poltrooneries, just as he always does. It was only when he drained\
  \ the last dregs from his tumbler of post-breakfast Squelcho! that I noticed something\
  \ amiss.\nInstead of putting on his Uruguayan Notary Public's boots and crashing\
  \ out of the door into the teeming downpour, as I expected him to do, he stayed\
  \ sitting at the breakfast table, a thin smile playing about his lips, a fat beetle\
  \ scuttling through his bouffant, a blob of marmalade on his cravat.\n\u201CLook!\
  \ Can you see it, O my cherished bundle of utter loveliness?\u201D he said, pointing\
  \ at a corner of the room.\nI could see nothing, save for some dust.\n\u201CIt is\
  \ my little man, my homunculus. He has been following me about, in his satin and\
  \ tat, in his frock coat and bippety-boppety hat. He whispers words I can never\
  \ quite hear.\u201D\nI asked Dobson what on earth he was talking about. He continued\
  \ to prattle.\n\u201CEven were I able to hear him, I am not sure I would be able\
  \ to understand his whisperings. Not only is he a foreign little man, from remote\
  \ and distant parts not shown on any map, but he always whispers with his mouth\
  \ full. He is forever stuffing his gob with smokers\u2019 poptarts, of which he\
  \ seems to have an endless supply. Have you noticed any packets missing from the\
  \ larder, O my buttercup?\u201D\n\u201CYou mean the pantry, Dobson,\u201D I said,\
  \ \u201CNo, I have noticed no such thing.\u201D\n\u201CLarder, pantry, pantry, larder,\u201D\
  \ he went on, excitably, \u201CSofa, cushions, chaise longue, pouff\xE9. Lay me\
  \ place and bake me pie, I'm starving for me gravy. Leave my shoes and door unlocked,\
  \ I might just slip away. If I slip away, perhaps I can escape my little man. But\
  \ it's likely he will follow me. God knows, I haven't been able to shake him off\
  \ these past seventeen years.\u201D\nIt was at this point that I asked Dobson if\
  \ he had taken leave of his senses. But he ignored the question.\n\u201CHe came\
  \ seventeen years ago, and to this day he has shown no intention of going away,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CSometimes he moves his arms as if they were the propellers on a\
  \ seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered Fabre Hydravion, for example. I have to place\
  \ extra paperweights on my escritoire when he does this in close proximity to it,\
  \ to prevent my papers being blown away. Are you sure you can't see him?\u201D\n\
  I assured Dobson that I could not.\n\u201CI think the propelling of his arms is\
  \ an attempt to dry his hands,\u201D he continued, \u201CHis palms are horribly\
  \ moist. Indeed, for such a tiny man he is surprisingly moist in every particular.\
  \ Yet whenever he follows me into the bathroom, he shuns the towels. They seem to\
  \ frighten him, as nothing else does. Imagine that, being frightened of towels!\
  \ Tea-towels, too, especially those of a souvenir variety, bearing depictions of\
  \ important buildings and tourist attractions. Once he vomited all over the tea-towel\
  \ we bought in the gift shop at St Bibblybibdib's Cathedral. When I tried to launder\
  \ it he snatched it away from me and tore it into strips and fed it to his chaffinch.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhat chaffinch?\u201D I could not help but ask.\n\u201CThere, perched on\
  \ his shoulder, tiny but weirdly luminous. It is the only chaffinch I know that\
  \ glows in the dark. Or eats linen. Or monkeys. It ate the little man's little monkey,\
  \ which he kept at the end of a length of string, during the Tet Offensive. It ate\
  \ the string too. It is quite a chaffinch!\u201D\nBy now I was convinced that Dobson\
  \ had gone doolally. Thinking a violent bash on the head might bring him to his\
  \ senses, I went to fetch a hammer. When I returned, there was no sign of him, and\
  \ the front door was ajar. I looked in the shoe cupboard, but all of his many many\
  \ many boots were lined up neatly along the bootesquade. Had Dobson done the unthinkable,\
  \ and left the house in his socks?\nIndeed he had. Towards midday, also known as\
  \ noon, when the hands of the clock both point upwards in an uncompromising vertical,\
  \ I received a call from the seaside police. Dobson was sat on a pier, bootless,\
  \ cradling in his arms the limp body of a strangled eel, and staring out to sea.\
  \ His socks were wet, his cravat was awry, and there were traces of choc ice around\
  \ his mouth. A ring of lumpenproles had gathered to taunt him. I rushed out and\
  \ jumped aboard a charabanc heading for the seaside.\nThe police had removed Dobson\
  \ from the pier and installed him in a cubby within the seagull sanctuary. I had\
  \ to use all my powers of persuasion to get past the armed security guards. I found\
  \ Dobson sprawled on a bunk looking bewildered.\n\u201CWincklemann is gone!\u201D\
  \ he cried.\n\u201CWincklemann?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CMy little man, my homunculus,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CHe followed me at a trot all the way to the seaside, and while\
  \ I was at the kiosk on the pier buying several choc ices he lost his footing and\
  \ fell from the pier into the sea, the sea, the terrible vast wet sea. I fear he\
  \ drowned therein, my little man.\u201D\nIt occurred to me that if Wincklemann were\
  \ as tiny a man as Dobson claimed him to be, it was likely that he was so light\
  \ in weight that he would bippety-bop, like his hat, upon the water, rather than\
  \ sink. Then it further occurred to me that Dobson had gone doolally, and that this\
  \ purported homunculus was nothing but a figment of his fuming brain. I was still\
  \ carrying the hammer, so I gave Dobson a smart crack on the head with it, hoping\
  \ to restore his reason.\nAlas! The hammer blow had quite the opposite effect. While\
  \ rubbing his bonce, Dobson gazed into the corner of the seagull sanctuary cubby\
  \ and let out a joyful yell.\n\u201CWincklemann! You have escaped from the clutches\
  \ of the wild wet sea! Where once you were moist, you are now soaked to the skin.\
  \ Were you not fearful of towels I would dab you dry. But I am so happy to see you.\
  \ What is that you are whispering to me in your foreign guttural tongue?\u201D\n\
  Of course, there was nothing in the corner except for some dust and a stray seagull\
  \ feather. After signing some papers, and feeding cream crackers to an injured seagull,\
  \ I was allowed to bring Dobson home. It is now early evening, and he has insisted\
  \ on setting a third place at the dinner table, and carefully portioning out a helping\
  \ of jellied hare \u2018n\u2019 jugged eels \u2018n\u2019 jagged shards of frozen\
  \ celery for his invisible little man. I am at my wits\u2019 end, Dr Fang, or at\
  \ the end of my tether, whichever end is likely to snap first, and I need your help.\
  \ Please come at once.\n\nDear Mrs Wincklemann, wrote Dr Fang, At your request,\
  \ I have conducted an examination of the brain, for which my fee is forty-five panes,\
  \ ten soilings, and sixpins. Please pay in cash by midnight, or I will confiscate\
  \ the brain and place it in a jar in my cupboard o\u2019 brains, cackling as I do\
  \ so.\nIt is my considered opinion that you are suffering from a common malady,\
  \ viz. indulging a phantasy that you are a personal friend and confidante of the\
  \ twentieth century's titanic, if out of print, pamphleteer. In your case, there\
  \ is an intriguing level of displacement, where you imagine it is not you, but your\
  \ husband, who is bosom pals with Dobson. Incidentally, your husband is indeed an\
  \ extremely tiny little man who could easily be mistaken for a homunculus. Perhaps\
  \ that is what caused the illusory vapours in your brain.\nAs I say, it is not unusual\
  \ for insignificant riffraff such as yourself to attach themselves to illustrious\
  \ figures such as Dobson. I know of another patient who spent many years convinced\
  \ she was on intimate terms with octogenarian Francophile pop songstress Petula\
  \ Clark. If you take the pills I have given you, six per day for seventeen years,\
  \ your symptoms will surely alleviate. I also recommend close reading of Dobson's\
  \ pamphlet At No Time Did I Ever Cradle In My Arms The Limp Body Of A Strangled\
  \ Eel Upon A Pier While Taunted By Lumpenproles, And I Have Signed A Legal Affidavit\
  \ To This Effect; And Other Essays, Together With A Spirit Photograph Of Petula\
  \ Clark Holding Hands With A Homunculus (out of print).\n[2017-11-09]"
