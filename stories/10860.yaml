text: "A recently dug-up diary for this day in 1900:\nI am a pimply ragamuffin of\
  \ no great consequence in this world. But my doings will resound down the ages,\
  \ and be pored over by generations yet unborn, because I am keeping this diary and,\
  \ at intervals, every one hundred pages or so, I put the scribbled sheets into a\
  \ bag and the bag into a sack and the sack into a box and the box I bury in a field,\
  \ in different fields dotted hither and thither, where one day in the future a man\
  \ wielding a spade or shovel will dig up my diary and it will be pored over, as\
  \ I said just now, by generations yet unborn.\nFirst thing this morning, I gazed\
  \ into the greasy glass and counted my pimples. There is a different number every\
  \ day, which I jot down in a separate notebook. It seems that overnight, while I\
  \ lie on my straw pallet in the corner of the barn, thrashing about, fast asleep\
  \ yet disturbed by terrible dreams, several pimples erupt and several others subside\
  \ or vanish. Sometimes I trace the patterns they form on my whey-coloured face,\
  \ just in case, like the constellations of stars in the sky, there is a message\
  \ to be read in them. I have buried some of my pimple diagrams alongside my diary\
  \ pages, so perhaps in the future a significance I cannot fathom will be apparent\
  \ to those who come after me, armed as they may be with a greater knowledge of patterns\
  \ and mysteries and pimple distribution.\nThen I took my begging bowl and sat on\
  \ a clump by a verge and hoped for alms. A passing person gave me an old holed woollen\
  \ sock to serve as a mitten for my tiny frozen hand. Oddly, both of my hands are\
  \ unpimpled. Another passing person had no matching sock, alas, but did give me\
  \ a bar of soap. But today I had chosen the wrong clump, or the wrong verge, or\
  \ both, because nobody else passed all day long.\nTowards sunset I trudged off to\
  \ Brantwood to see my one pal, the mad old gent with the Old Testament beard whose\
  \ demented ravings I keep meaning to transcribe. But I will need a different notebook,\
  \ different from my diary notebooks and my pimple count notebook. Perhaps I will\
  \ be able to get one in exchange for the bar of soap from a filthy stationer.\n\
  As I approached Brantwood, skirting the reservoir and passing the waterfall and\
  \ the harbour, where the Jumping Jenny was tied to a painter, and the ice house\
  \ and the slate seat facing the tumbling stream, I sensed something amiss. My pimples\
  \ grew hot, a sure sign of impending calamity. And indeed, as I came to the house,\
  \ out of it emerged a black-clad fellow with a grave look etched upon his countenance,\
  \ who exclaimed:\n\u201CMistah Ruskin\u2014he dead.\u201D\n\n[2013-01-20]"
