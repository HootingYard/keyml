text: "My attention was drawn to a letter in today's Grauniad:\nBrian Simpson (Obituary,\
  \ 2 February) was indeed a gifted raconteur. At a British legal history conference\
  \ many years ago, his presentation on 19th-century case law on liability for reservoir\
  \ maintenance wasn't just learned and lucid, it was also one of the best stand-up\
  \ comedy routines I've ever seen or heard.\u2014Dr J B Post, Castletownbere, County\
  \ Cork, Ireland\nThe good doctor Post does not give the precise date of the legal\
  \ history conference to which he refers, which is a pity, as it leaves us unclear\
  \ whether the late Brian Simpson was inspired by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson,\
  \ or vice versa. For nineteenth-century case law on liability for reservoir maintenance\
  \ was, as any Dobsonist knows, a pet subject, even a Shandean hobby-horse, of the\
  \ pamphleteer's. His antipathy to public speaking meant that he would never have\
  \ had an audience rollicking in the aisles, as Simpson did, and not even the most\
  \ enthusiastic Dobsonist would call his many pamphlets on the subject funny, or\
  \ even mildly amusing. If anything, the Dobsonian brow was beclouded by a mist of\
  \ deathly seriousness whenever he addressed the issue of reservoir maintenance,\
  \ from any angle. For he was fascinated not just by nineteenth-century case law\
  \ on liability, but by the minutiae of reservoir maintenance in other centuries,\
  \ and in fields other than the legal, such as general water management, engineering,\
  \ geography, geology, history, archaeology, and the by-ways of fanatical and hysterical\
  \ religion.\nIt has been said that Dobson's interest in reservoir maintenance began\
  \ after he toppled from a dam into an ill-maintained reservoir one St Mungo's Day\
  \ in a year no scholar has ever been able to pin down with any certainty. What he\
  \ was doing atop the dam in the first place is one of those ineffable mysteries\
  \ that drives sensible persons to the brink of madness if they cannot be persuaded\
  \ to drop the matter. One is reminded of the tragic case of F X Spray, who lost\
  \ his wits after thirty years of increasingly monomaniacal research, without ever\
  \ having ascertained which dam Dobson toppled from, in which country, on what date,\
  \ in what year, and whether the boots he was wearing at whatever time it was had\
  \ any role to play in his topplement.\nAdding to the tragedy of the Spray case is\
  \ the possibility that the pamphleteer's interest in reservoir maintenance was not\
  \ occasioned by his own experience at all. New research into his benighted infancy\
  \ suggests that among the few periodicals to which his parents subscribed was Annals\
  \ Of Reservoir Maintenance, bound copies of which were found in a dustbin about\
  \ a mile from the pamphleteer's childhood home, at least one volume carrying on\
  \ its reindeer-hide cover a thumbprint almost certainly belonging to Dobson p\xE8\
  re. But these are matters of conjecture, and conjecture is the enemy of blinkered\
  \ certainty, as well we know.\nWearing our blinkers, we are able to assert that\
  \ Dobson wrote no fewer than a dozen pamphlets on the subject of reservoir maintenance,\
  \ each of them, alas, now out of print. With equal certainty, we can say that the\
  \ most important of these pamphlets, the one which will be read a hundred, nay,\
  \ two hundred years hence, if of course anybody sees fit to reprint it, is the one\
  \ in which Dobson posits a correlation between the types of ducks disporting themselves\
  \ in a reservoir and the number of criminals drowned in the same reservoir, after\
  \ being convicted of their crime or crimes, bound hand and foot with hemp, inserted\
  \ into a burlap sack, and flung into the reservoir by a pair of executioners each\
  \ paid in poultry for their services. Such were the ways of judicial mercilessness,\
  \ at one time, in certain districts. One might think that drowned wretches from\
  \ the past and present-day ducks had no connection whatsoever. One might even continue\
  \ to think this after reading Dobson's pamphlet. For it must be said that, for all\
  \ its statistical tables and graphs and bold illustrations, Ducks And Criminals\
  \ And Well-Maintained Reservoirs (out of print, as previously indicated) is written\
  \ in a sort of hysterically overwrought prose, possibly inspired by hypnagogic visions,\
  \ which make the thrust of Dobson's arguments extremely difficult to grasp. There\
  \ is also the point, of course, that the pamphleteer could hardly tell one type\
  \ of duck from another, even when armed with an illustrated field guide suitable\
  \ for nippers. His ignorance does not deter him, and he makes what one gathers,\
  \ if read several times to wring some sense out of them, are sweeping pronouncements\
  \ about matching tallies of pickpockets and pochards, forgers and mergansers, murderers\
  \ and teal.\nThe other eleven pamphlets on reservoir maintenance are somewhat easier\
  \ to understand, written in plainer prose, and were collected together in a sort\
  \ of \xFCberpamphlet entitled Eleven Essays On Reservoir Maintenance, By One Who\
  \ Knows (out of print). The cover featured a spectacular mezzotint by the noted\
  \ mezzotintist Rex Tint, showing a mezzotintist sitting on a camping stool atop\
  \ a spectacular dam, executing a mezzotint of a spectacular reservoir, in which\
  \ pochards, mergansers and teal bob about on the surface, while patches of shading\
  \ and cross-hatching hint at a number of soaking wet sacks many fathoms deep, containing\
  \ the soaking wet corpses of pickpockets and forgers and murderers, bound with soaking\
  \ wet hemp.\n[2011-02-05]"
