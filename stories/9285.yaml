text: 'Imagine for a moment that you have a pet swan. What would you call it? Alan?
  Belinda? Clive? Dot? I could continue through the alphabet, but I won''t, not for
  the time being. If I did, we would soon enough get to J. I like to think that I
  would not, at that juncture, pick the name Jack. Not for a swan. It doesn''t seem
  right. Yet that is the name Anna Pavlova gave to her swan, as can be seen in this
  tremendous photograph, kindly sent to me by David Cranmer. Click for gigantic version.
