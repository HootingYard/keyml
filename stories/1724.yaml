text: "\nI was much taken with this illustration of a Victorian organised fern hunt,\
  \ reproduced at the excellent Victorian Era blog. It reminded me that Dobson was\
  \ a great one for fern hunts. Although he was a pamphleteer decisively of the twentieth\
  \ century, he had about him something of the Victorian, especially at certain periods\
  \ of his life, such as the two decades or so he spent blasted out of his brain on\
  \ laudanum, as were most Victorians most of the time, if some accounts are to be\
  \ believed. Gladstone, to give but one example, regularly made speeches in the House\
  \ of Commons with his head swimming in an opiate fog. It makes one wonder if we\
  \ would \_be better governed today were the illiterate thickos in Parliament to\
  \ have their brains ravaged and jangled a tad.\nIn spite of his boundless ignorance\
  \ of the natural world, or perhaps because of it, Dobson developed quite a taste\
  \ for fern hunting. In a memorable pamphlet, he described the attraction:\nHunting\
  \ animals is the sport of fools. Nearly all animals run away when pursued. Ferns,\
  \ on the other hand, stay right where they are, so you can go crashing through thickets\
  \ with much gusto, a determined jut to the jaw, every so often emitting cries of\
  \ panic or revelation, or both, all the while safe in the knowledge that your quarry\
  \ is not dashing away over the fields, vanishing over the horizon, leaving you and\
  \ your band of fellow adventurers exhausted and stupid and empty-handed.\nDobson\
  \ did not always grasp the point of an organised fern hunt, however, and would arrive\
  \ at the appointed gathering-place armed with a net, or a blunderbuss, or sometimes\
  \ with a geological hammer. It had to be patiently, and repeatedly, explained to\
  \ him what a fern was, information he had singular difficulty lodging in his skull,\
  \ whether or not it was doused with laudanum. In another pamphlet, at another time,\
  \ for example, he wrote this:\nWhat better sport is there than chasing a wild fern\
  \ across the countryside, watching it dash away over the fields, vanishing over\
  \ the horizon, leaving you and your band of fellow adventurers exhausted and happy\
  \ and empty-handed, but refreshed by bucolic air, panting, drugged up to the eyeballs\
  \ and ready to go home and write dozens of pages of De Quinceyan babble?\nTo his\
  \ credit, Dobson never made any attempt to suppress the pamphlet in which he wrote\
  \ this drivel, but in any case, like all his works it was soon out of print, and\
  \ forgotten, just as we have forgotten the delights of organised fern hunts.\n[2009-02-08]"
