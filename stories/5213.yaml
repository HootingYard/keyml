text: "A paragraph that leaves you wanting to know more\u2026\n\u201C[An] episode\
  \ is highlighted in Ritual Magic In England (1970) by Francis King who, misled by\
  \ Dion Fortune's account of it, accused Mo\xEFna [Mathers] of killing a Miss Netta\
  \ Fornario by black magic. As the incidents leading to Miss Fornario's death did\
  \ not take place until some eighteen months after Mo\xEFna's own, the charge is\
  \ scarcely worth refuting. Even if the latter had been living, the scratches found\
  \ on the corpse are less likely to have resulted from an attack by Mo\xEFna in the\
  \ form of a monster cat, than from running naked in the dark over rough country,\
  \ which Miss Fornario had done immediately before her collapse.\u201D\nIthell Colquhoun,\
