text: "If you hear news from Haemoglobin Towers that birds are dropping dead from\
  \ the sky and cows stand stunned in the fields, it can mean only one thing. Alas,\
  \ Mrs Gubbins has a new musical fad. The octogenarian crone has taken her dusty\
  \ hi fi system down from the shelf, opened the windows, and is blasting out the\
  \ latest acquisitions from her record collection, day and night, over and over again.\n\
  Last time this happened, her undiluted enthusiasm for The Fall meant that the peasants\
  \ thereabouts had to put up with the complete works of Mark E Smith cranked out\
  \ at ear-splitting volume for weeks on end. La Gubbins only grew tired of the self-styled\
  \ \u201CNorthern white crap that talks back\u201D after it was pointed out to her\
  \ that Smith is slowly but surely turning into Anthony Burgess\u2014Mancunian, drunk\
  \ on words, and frighteningly prolific, of course, but the most compelling evidence\
  \ is the physical resemblance.\n\nLa Gubbins had always harboured a deep if irrational\
  \ hatred of Burgess, so she burned all her Fall records on a pyre and silence reigned.\
  \ But now she has discovered the work of Swiss maestro Blinky Guido, laid her hands\
  \ on every single record he ever made, and is in the throes of madness. Hence the\
  \ dead birds and the stunned cows.\nBlinky Guido will be known to some of you as\
  \ the man who created prog-wop, an unholy alliance of progressive rock and doo-wop\
  \ which some enlightened lands have made illegal. You may have sat through the full\
  \ twenty-minute horror that is Why Do Fools Fall In Love In The Magic Kingdom Of\
  \ Elves or, even worse, These Little Eldritch Unicorns Of Mine. Someone swears they\
  \ saw Mrs Gubbins smuggling a mellotron into her room the other day, which doesn't\
  \ bear thinking about.\nPerhaps the only way to bring an end to this nightmare is\
  \ to doctor a photograph of the Swiss prog-wop pioneer to make him look like J B\
  \ Priestley, another writer who elicits from Mrs Gubbins a strangulated cry of loathing.\n\
