text: "The new year got off to an auspicious start yesterday morning. Almost the first\
  \ words I heard, after tuning in to Farming Today on BBC Radio Four, were \u201C\
  swan guru\u201D. Outside, it was still the dark before dawn, but I resolved, with\
  \ new year vim, to go in search of my very own swan guru.\nI was not listening to\
  \ the radio with sufficient attention to learn whether a swan guru was, on the one\
  \ hand, a human being possessed of breathtaking insight into swans or, on the other,\
  \ a swan possessed of breathtaking spiritual insight which could act as my teacher\
  \ and guide. But I knew which one I preferred, and it wasn't the human being. And\
  \ so, as the first light of the new year spread across the sky, like a patient etherised\
  \ upon a table, I set out for Nameless Pond, in search of a swan.\nAs I lolloped\
  \ towards the pond, I recalled the popular Hooting Yard series Notable Authors Sitting\
  \ On Swans, which featured photographs of notable authors sitting on swans. The\
  \ swan upon which the infant Raymond Roussel sat, for example\u2014was it a mere\
  \ swan, or was it the writer's swan guru? I did not suppose I would ever know the\
  \ answer to that question, but just posing it made me all the keener to lay claim\
  \ to my own swan guru.\n\nStanding at the edge of Nameless Pond, on which several\
  \ sprightly and savage new year swans were scudding, I tried to determine which\
  \ one would be the perfect spiritual teacher. But then I was struck by two thoughts.\
  \ One, I am extremely myopic. Two, I am ornithologically ignorant. If I were to\
  \ pick a particular swan, here and now, as my guru, would I be able to recognise\
  \ that swan on subsequent visits to Nameless Pond? I had to concede that this seemed\
  \ unlikely. In my world, a swan is a swan is a swan. Well then, that being so, why\
  \ not choose the swan nearest at hand as my guru? Next time I came here, the nearest\
  \ swan might well be an entirely different swan, but did that really matter, so\
  \ long as I received from it the spiritual succour I sought?\nConvinced that I had\
  \ hit upon an effective method of mitigating my myopia and ornithological ignorance,\
  \ I fixed my gaze upon the nearest swan. The next couple of minutes would prove\
  \ critical. I had to lay myself open, fully receptive to whatever spiritual wisdom\
  \ the swan saw fit to impart to me. The better to accomplish this, I gawped, open-mouthed,\
  \ dribbling slightly, like a dim-witted child. I tried to empty my brain of all\
  \ conscious thought, and I succeeded so well that I toppled over, having forgotten\
  \ how to stand upright. Sprawled in the pondside mud, I sensed a terrifying inrush\
  \ of what I can only describe as swanness or swanosity. It surged through me, magnificently.\n\
  I stood up, dusted myself down, bid adieu to my swan guru with a wave of my hand,\
  \ and set off for home. Woe betide anybody I met along the way. With one thwack\
  \ of my wing, I would break their arm.\n[2016-01-02]"
