text: "Suspicion is a beast with a thousand eyes, but most of them are blind, or colour-blind,\
  \ or askew, or rolling, or yellow. There is too little respect paid to the good\
  \ resolutions which are so popular a feature of the New Year. It is a pleasure to\
  \ see a modern clergyman expressing his horror of the dancing of the moment as Canon\
  \ Newbolt did in St Paul's. It is not easy to decide what is the dullest feature\
  \ in the Tango Teas upon which Londoners are now wasting their afternoons and their\
  \ silver.\nAlmost everyone who has committed a murder knows that the business has\
  \ its tragic side. It is significant of the change that has come over the religious\
  \ imagination that a number of representative clergymen have issued a manifesto\
  \ of disbelief in Hell and no heresy-hunt has begun. There has been an increasing\
  \ demand lately for cheerful books.\nThere has been a delightful correspondence\
  \ going on in the Times about Mdlle Gaby Deslys. Surely honest men may thank God\
  \ they belong to \u2018the Stupid Party\u2019! When Mr Churchill referred in Manchester\
  \ to the piling up of armaments as so much misdirected human energy, he said something\
  \ with which men of all parties will agree, except those few romantic souls who\
  \ believe that it is a bracing thing to shed the blood of a foreigner every now\
  \ and then. There is a cant of Christmas, and there is a cant of anti-Christmas.\n\
  It is still the custom in civilised countries for the politicians to call each other\
  \ names. An amazing story of coincidences appears in the Westminster Gazette. There\
  \ is nothing in which the newspapers deal more generously than indignation. Mr Galsworthy\
  \ has been writing to the Times on \u201Cthe heartlessness of Parliament.\u201D\
  \ In spite of the progress of civilisation, there are still women to whom the returning\
  \ Spring is mainly a festival of dresses.\nIt is easy to imagine the enthusiasm\
  \ of the audience at Manchester when a black cat walked on to the platform at a\
  \ meeting of Sir Edward Carson's. Being shocked is evidently still one of the favourite\
  \ pastimes of the British people. Father Hugh Benson has been praised for his courage\
  \ in confessing that he could not read Sir Walter Scott. There is a good deal to\
  \ be said for Mr Lloyd George's complaint against the world for its treatment of\
  \ politicians. It is a remarkable thing that human beings have never yet got reconciled\
  \ to disaster.\nMr Justice Darling, before passing a sentence of seven years\u2019\
  \ penal servitude on Julia Decies for wounding her lover with intent to kill him,\
  \ made a remark which must interest all students of the morals of murder. It was\
  \ only the other day that Mr G. A. Birmingham gave us a play about a hoax at the\
  \ expense of an Irish village, in course of which a statue was erected to an imaginary\
  \ Irish-American General, the aide-de-camp of the Lord-Lieutenant coming down from\
  \ Dublin to perform the unveiling ceremony. There does not at first glance seem\
  \ to be any great similarity between Mr Thomas Hardy and M. Anatole France, the\
  \ latter of whom has come to London to see how enthusiastically Englishmen can dine\
  \ when they wish to express their feelings about literature.\nIt is only now and\
  \ then, when some great disaster like the sinking of the Empress of Ireland occurs,\
  \ that man recovers his ancient dread of the sea. The appearance of the first number\
  \ of Blast ought to put an end to the Futurist movement in England. Mr E. F. Benson\
  \ has been attacking the critics, and reviving against them the old accusation that\
  \ they are merely men who have failed in the arts. One of the most unexpected pages\
  \ in Sir Edward Cook's Life of Florence Nightingale, is that in which he describes\
  \ Miss Nightingale, in a phrase Lord Goschen once used about himself, as a \u201C\
  passionate statistician.\u201D\nYou see? This and that, as promised by my title.\
  \ There's never a dull moment at Hooting Yard, is there? Well, I grant that not\
  \ every one of the above sentences is scintillating, but you never quite knew what\
  \ was coming next, and if you were yawning your head off at one thing, you likely\
  \ snapped back to attention soon enough. And think how educative it has been, the\
  \ this and that. You will have learned several things I bet you did not know before.\
  \ Next time you are invited to a sophisticated cocktail party and there is a discomfiting\
  \ lull in the blather, you can pipe up with a titbit about Canon Newbolt's views\
  \ on modern dance or the tragic side of murder or black cats or Florence Nightingale\
  \ the passionate statistician.\nThis is where I fear I have been going astray in\
  \ my daily thousandish-word essays. There has been far too much airy persiflage\
  \ (to borrow a phrase from Mister Nizz) and witterings of questionable or indeed\
  \ no consequence. Instead I ought to have been writing on superstition, on good\
  \ resolutions, on the sin of dancing, on thoughts at a tango tea, on the humours\
  \ of murder, on stupidity and waste and demagogues and coincidences and disasters\
  \ and the sea and all the other subjects addressed in The Book Of This And That\
  \ by Robert Lynd, published by Mills & Boon in 1915. What I have given you is the\
  \ opening sentence from each of the twenty-eight essays in the book, all of which\
  \ first appeared in the New Statesman. Hard to imagine that clapped-out husk of\
  \ a magazine being even half-way readable, but that was the past.\nWe are nearly\
  \ two thirds of the way through the year and I have managed to keep up my daily\
  \ quota, but I think as we approach the final few months I need to get my noggin\
  \ screwed on tight. The time has come for more this and further that, and much,\
  \ much less of whatever isn't this and that. Hold on to your hats!\n[2012-08-22]"
