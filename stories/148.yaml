text: "I must apologise to readers for the distinct lack of recent posts. I have been\
  \ preoccupied with a number of matters which have left me, bafflingly, bereft of\
  \ fresh insights into the world o\u2019 Hooting Yard. I expect my pea-sized yet\
  \ pulsating brain will soon generate further reports from that fool's paradise,\
  \ but in the meantime readers may like to send in suggestions for areas of investigation.\n\
  Although I have not been writing, I have been reading, and it seems only polite\
  \ to share with you just a few of the things I have learned during the past couple\
  \ of weeks.\nOne of the Heaven's Gate suicides, the followers of Marshall Herff\
  \ Applewhite (\u201CDo\u201D) and Bonnie Lu Nettles (\u201CTi\u201D) who hoped to\
  \ join a spaceship trailing in the wake of the Hale-Bopp comet in 1997, was the\
  \ brother of Nichelle Nicholls, who played Lieutenant Uhura in the original Star\
  \ Trek series.\nStalin and Trotsky first met each other on Whitechapel Road, on\
  \ the site which is now occupied by a McDonald's.\nUnlike the guinea pig, which\
  \ is neither from Guinea nor a pig, the Bath Oliver biscuit is not misleadingly\
  \ named. It was invented in the town of Bath by Dr William Oliver in the eighteenth\
  \ century.\nMao Tse-Tung never brushed his teeth nor took a bath or shower. A factotum\
  \ was employed to rub him down with hot towels when he became grubby.\nMore soon\u2026\
