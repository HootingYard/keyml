text: "The first time I flew in an aeroplane was almost forty years ago, on an Aeroflot\
  \ flight to the Soviet Union. My abiding memory is of the many flies buzzing around\
  \ within the plane. Perhaps it was an Aeroflot thing. I mention this because, having\
  \ flown to and from Maryland a few weeks ago, I am still debilitated and twitching\
  \ and shattered by whatever hideous germs were aboard the planes I sat slumped in\
  \ for hours. That is why the unaccustomed silence at Hooting Yard has persisted,\
  \ for longer than I would have thought possible.\nYet there is a certain appeal\
  \ in being an invalid. One gets the opportunity to emit tremulous and woebegone\
  \ sighs, for example, like unto a dying swan. Having said that, I do not think I\
  \ have ever witnessed the death of a swan. Perhaps they do not sigh, but shriek\
  \ or whoop. I could slaughter a swan to find out, when I am better, but, if caught\
  \ in the act, I would no doubt be arrested and roughed up by Inspector Cargpan and\
  \ his goons down in the basement of the local nick.\nMy local nick, incidentally,\
  \ which is now closed down and shuttered, is the very same one where Alfred Hitchcock\
  \ was once locked up. His father, who was a pal of the local coppers, took the young\
  \ Alfred to the station and had him chucked in a cell for a while, not because he\
  \ had done anything amiss, but to show him what would happen to him if ever he did\
  \ do something amiss. It is not difficult to see the germ of many a later Hitchcock\
  \ hero's predicament in that childhood incident. It would be interesting to discover\
  \ if an icy blonde and an egg were somehow involved, and then we would have the\
  \ key to the adult Hitchcock's obsessions. Some say swans are among my own obsessions,\
  \ and they may well be correct. I cannot, however, recall any childhood traumas\
  \ in which a swan played a significant part.\nAnother thing about the invalid state\
  \ is that my dreams seem particularly vivid. Last night, for example, I dreamed\
  \ that my mother was still alive at eighty-seven, had become a keen aficionado of\
  \ Het Internet, and had, for the past few years, been engaged in a daily exchange\
  \ of emails with Keith Richards, for whom she had become a sort of ancient Muse.\
  \ When I awoke, I found it very very difficult to acknowledge that this was merely\
  \ a figment of my fuming brainpans.\n\nKeith Richards\u2019 ancient Muse, before\
  \ she was ancient\n[2012-12-19]"
