text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I address the important topic of mud idol maintenance,\
  \ with some simple tips on sprucing up your talismanic fetish object. This is the\
  \ first article in a projected series intended to cover everything a sane person\
  \ might wish to know about the subject. My people are currently in talks with a\
  \ publisher, with a view to issuing the complete set as a part-work, building week\
  \ by week into an exhaustive mud idol encyclopaedia, to be slotted in to ring-binders,\
  \ eventually taking up an implausible amount of shelf-space. The marketing people\
  \ insist that something like this will only sell if there is a \u201Cfree gift\u201D\
  \ every week, so we are looking at the idea of giving away sachets of mud, sourced\
  \ from a bog of mystic legend. If any readers can suggest an apt bog, please get\
  \ in touch via your spirit medium.\n[2011-01-21]"
