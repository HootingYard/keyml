text: "Plotinus, the philosopher of ancient Greece who gave us the six Enneads, had\
  \ atrocious handwriting, did not properly separate individual words, and did not\
  \ bother himself with the niceties of spelling. His student Porphyry, who edited,\
  \ polished and arranged the Enneads for publication, had the thankless preliminary\
  \ task of transcribing Plotinus\u2019 shoddy and near-illegible scribbles. That\
  \ was almost two thousand years ago, yet in many ways it describes perfectly the\
  \ working relationship that obtained between Dobson and Marigold Chew. The out of\
  \ print pamphleteer had an abysmal scrawl, possibly because of the unusual way he\
  \ clutched his pencil, like a monkey with a pin-cushion. It may be difficult to\
  \ make sense of that simile, but go and lie down in a darkened room and screw your\
  \ eyes tightly shut and everything will become clear. For salvaging any clarity\
  \ at all from Dobson's notebooks, we have Marigold Chew to thank. Without her, not\
  \ one of those majestic pamphlets would ever have been tucked lovingly on to the\
  \ shelves of a motorway service station or airport bookstall.\nAmong much that they\
  \ had in common, Porphyry and Marigold Chew were excellent proofreaders, capable\
  \ of spotting the tiniest error and correcting it. This is not a job you would give\
  \ to the American cinema player Bruce Willis. Mr Willis is apparently a keen contributor\
  \ to blogs and chatrooms, and when other readers pointed out his many infelicities\
  \ of grammar and spelling, he issued the immortal retort \u201Cproofreading is for\
  \ pussies\u201D. He will not be considered for a work experience placement at Hooting\
  \ Yard.\n[2007-10-10]"
