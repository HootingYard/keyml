text: 'It was remiss of me never to follow up the doings of Splotchy Astrid, the reproachful
  spinster. Many letters have thumped on to the doormat at Haemoglobin Towers from
  readers eager to know what happened next, and I have ignored them, disgracefully.
  However, thanks to No. 25,088 set by Crucible, I can bring you up to speed.

  It seems Splotchy Astrid was tucking in to some tiramisu in a worldly teashop, when
  a lethargic menial began playing an anthem of the Resistance on a viola. A chill
  came over the room, and a sagacious adult customer challenged the menial to a bout
  of fisticuffs. The reproachful spinster was well aware that this was a lethal locality,
  for her itinerary had taken her past the sordid roadsign, daubed with four letter
  words, which led her here in the first place. She was the only eyewitness to the
  altercation, apart from an arty gentleman suffering from amnesia.

  To be continued, one of these days.
