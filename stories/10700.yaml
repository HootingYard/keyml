text: "\nWhen I was a tot, one of my treasured books was a Rupert Bear Annual, the\
  \ only one I ever owned. I pored over the stories in this volume again and again,\
  \ looking at the pictures, reading the tales in the rhyming couplet captions, and\
  \ then rereading them in the prose versions printed below. Nutwood seemed a mysterious\
  \ and magical world, where a bear lived with his ursine ma and pa, counted an elephant\
  \ and a badger and a pig among his pals, where the local bobby was a dog called\
  \ Police Constable Growler, and where the cast of human characters included an eccentric\
  \ professor with a dwarvish valet and a mystic Oriental Yoko Ono type named Tigerlily,\
  \ not forgetting Beryl the girl guide and an assortment of fisherfolk, tinkers,\
  \ peasants and explorers.\nI have very few mementoes of my childhood, and the Rupert\
  \ Annual was among those I thought lost. I could not, at any rate, recall the last\
  \ time I had seen it. Occasionally I would rummage in secondhand bookshops seeking\
  \ a copy, though on the rare occasions I found one it proved to be ruinously expensive.\n\
  Then, last month, visiting my sister in Maryland, I discovered what had become of\
  \ my annual. In the late 1970s, my mother had given it to my niece, and ever since\
  \ it had been sitting unremarked on a bookshelf in my sister's house. I learned\
  \ this, however, on the way to the airport at the end of my stay, when for some\
  \ reason Rupert Bear cropped up in conversation.\nHow thrilled I was this morning\
  \ to unwrap my sister's Christmas gift\u2014the treasured book from my childhood.\
  \ And how astonished I was, leafing through it, to realise how much of Hooting Yard\
  \ is there in embryo. Weird countryside, picnics, entanglement in bracken and thorns,\
  \ eerie mists, aquatic sea beings. . . all this stuff must have entered my head\
  \ long, long ago, and nestled there. I shall examine the book more thoroughly and,\
  \ perhaps, in due course share with you lot the more Hooting Yardy elements I find\
  \ therein.\nAnd to my sister, much thanks! She appended this verse (appropriately\
  \ in rhyming couplets) to the wrapping:\nA Valediction for Rupert\nOh Rupert! Since\
  \ we needs must part\n  I wrap you in compelling art\nOf books beloved from long\
  \ ago,\n  Their whereabouts I do not know.\nLike you they may have flown away\n\
  \  Without permission, I dare say,\nAnd sit now on some distant shelf\n  Unloved,\
  \ neglected, by themself.\nDear Rupert you were never lost\n  But treasured, read,\
  \ and tossed\nAbout by little ones who loved you too\n  Just as much as Frank must\
  \ do.\nSafe journey home where you belong\n  And think of me, I shall be strong\n\
  And shed no tears as you depart\n  For books still live within the heart.\nNOTE\_\
  : My sister, by the by, is Rita Byrne Tull, whose Dispatches From The Former New\
  \ World appear in The Dabbler.\n[2012-12-25]"
