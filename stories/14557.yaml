text: 'The Paradox of Tarleton''s Pebble is a famous, or infamous, conundrum. It was
  first posed, not by Tarleton himself, but by his valet, the dwarf Crepusco. Legend
  has it that Crepusco crept into the room where Tarleton was hosting a swish and
  sophisticated cocktail party attended by various mountaineers, polar explorers,
  flappers, Jesuits, toad-headed robbers, Quakers, conjurers, reprobates, gas meter
  readers, spud-faced nippers, fanatics, greaseproof paper salesmen, composers, dentists,
  tuppenny-ha''penny tosspots, Grand Guignol performers, Chappaquiddick experts, foopball
  refs, tugboat captains, hedgers and ditchers, gondoliers, minstrels, troubadours,
  astronauts, emboldened milquetoasts, rhubarbarians, eel-men, dabblers, plotters,
  coppers, tanners, coopers, fletchers, tailors, tinkers, Oppidans, floozies, weathermen,
  mavens, bus conductors, out-of-town Pointy Towners, painters, pimps, and potters.
  Yes, potters. Several potters, indeed more potters than you could shake a stick
  at, were you minded to do so. Not for the first time, Tarleton had got the precise
  balance of his swish sophisticated cocktail party guest-list a little askew.

  Things were nevertheless going with a swing, in spite of the potter imbalance, when
  in crept Crepusco. He silenced the hubbub in his usual manner, by holding aloft
  the gold-painted head of an antique Italianate monkey doll, through which he ventriloquised.
  Then, in his horrible voice, raucous as a crow, he posed the conundrum which became
  known as the Paradox of Tarleton''s Pebble.

  The effect was instantaneous. The puzzle dizzied the brains of all those present,
  including Tarleton himself. It dizzied their brains and it also dizzied their bodies,
  so that the room became a scene of chaos, the guests reeling about, staggering,
  flailing, vomiting, and groaning.

  Well satisfied, Crepusco crept out and returned to his pantry. He replaced the head
  of the monkey doll on its shrine, fixed himself a snack, and sat in his rocking
  chair, rocking, creaking, back and forth, through the long winter evening, on the
  night before the Munich Air Disaster.
