  \ be mentioning St Joseph of Cupertino today, other than mere whim. You can read\
  \ about him here, to which I would add these observations from Some Human Oddities\_\
  : Studies In The Queer, The Uncanny And The Fanatical by Eric John Dingwall (1947):\n\
  \u201CAt the age of eight it was reported that he had his first ecstasy\_: and his\
  \ behaviour at school, where occasionally he used to sit agape and motionless and\
  \ with his eyes raised to heaven, earned him the nickname of \u2018Open Mouth\u2019\
  \u2026 he was admitted to the Capuchin Order in August 1620. At first he was destined\
  \ to work in the refectory, but the result of his frequent fits of absence of mind\
  \ and ecstatic states on the crockery was disastrous, and Joseph added to the irritation\
  \ caused by his breakages by wearing the pieces round his neck\u2026\_ the accounts\
  \ of his childhood, lack of education and later mental development suggest that\
  \ he was not far from what today we should call a state of feeble-mindedness. Bishop\
  \ Bonaventura Claver said that he was idiota.\u201D\n[2010-06-08]"
