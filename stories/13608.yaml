text: "It seems to me that Hooting Yard ought to have an overarching theme for the\
  \ new year, a programme or project to act as a spur to my puny and often idle brainpans.\
  \ The 2012 perpilocution project worked very well, for example, though similar schemes,\
  \ based on diaries in 2013 and birds in 2014 petered out fairly rapidly. What, then,\
  \ for 2015?\nI have been wondering for quite some time whether I ought to cobble\
  \ together an Encyclopaedia of Everything. Ambitious as this project is, it would\
  \ certainly keep me occupied for a year. The challenge is to subdivide Everything\
  \ into 365 discrete units, allowing me to pluck one from the midden each day and\
  \ to dazzle you lot with a well-crafted splurge of prose. A moment's thought, gazing\
  \ out of the window at crows in the wind, is enough to convince me of the foolhardiness\
  \ of this idea.\nBut if, instead of dealing with Everything, I limit myself to one\
  \ particular topic\u2014say, birds, or eggs, or foopball stars of the 1950s, or\
  \ instances of shadow puppetry in the cinema\u2014I run the risk of boring both\
  \ you lot and myself. There must be a happy medium, somewhere between the general\
  \ and the particular, not quite Everything, perhaps, but an Encyclopaedia of Much.\
  \ I then have to decide how to construct it, what arrangement to follow. The temptation\
  \ to stare out of the window again becomes overwhelming.\nI could begin, I suppose,\
  \ by telling you that a window is made out of glass, but that the crow I can see,\
  \ in the failing light, though the window, is not made of glass. It is entirely\
  \ possible to make a toy or decorative or model crow out of glass, but it is difficult\
  \ to imagine a window made out of crows. Let us nonetheless imagine such a thing.\
  \ You would need to gather together a fair number of crows, and jam them into a\
  \ frame such that they filled the space within the frame. To keep the crows in place\
  \ it would be best to slaughter them and then stuff them using your taxidermy skills.\
  \ You would then remove the glass window in its frame and replace it with the crow\
  \ window which, I think you will rapidly notice, occludes most if not all of the\
  \ light blazing in from the outside. Only, right now, the light is failing, not\
  \ blazing, so the new crow-window makes little difference. Either way, you still\
  \ need some interior artificial light, such as that emitted by candle-flames, unless\
  \ you wish to sit slumped in the darkness imagining, out on the lawn, a crow made\
  \ of glass. Consider, then, how everything relates to everything else, birds to\
  \ windows, taxidermy to candlelight, darkness to darkness at the dawning of the\
  \ year.\nEncyclopaedia Topics Addressed\_: candles, crows, glass, stuffing.\nIf\
  \ you have found this postage enlightening, please add your ha'ppenyworth to Mr\
  \ Key's pot. You may wish to donate even if you remain unenlightened and quite frankly\
  \ baffled by the sheer stupidity of the foregoing.\n\n[2015-01-01]"
