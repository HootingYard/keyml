text: "Not only has Hooting Yard been in security lockdown for a week or so, but Mr\
  \ Key has neglected to keep abreast of the goings-on in those corners of Het Internet\
  \ to which his fuming brain is usually attuned. I am thus a few days late in drawing\
  \ your attention to Brit's excellent piece in The Dabbler on Joyce's Ulysses.\n\
  No mention of that book can ever be allowed to pass without my chucking in the following\
  \ addenda:\n1. Here are extracts from two contemporary reviews of Ulysses, written\
  \ when it was strange and new:\n\u201CAn immense mass of clotted nonsense\u201D\
  \ \u2014 Teachers\u2019 World\n\u201CThe maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book\
  \ issued in our own or any other time\u2026 inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty\
  \ \u2026 a book that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic\
  \ asylum\u201D \u2014 The Sphere\n2. James Joyce always pronounced the title as\
  \ Oo-liss-iss.\n3. My late mother made a famous pronouncement on Joyce. Born in\
  \ Belgium, she came to Britain in her early twenties after her marriage to my father.\
  \ One of the ways she chose to improve her English was by reading through the canon\u2014\
  Jane Austen, the Bront\xEBs, George Eliot, Dickens, et cetera. She eventually decided\
  \ to tackle Ulysses. Casting it aside after a few pages, she declared\u2014after\
  \ a guttural Flemish expostulation which defies accurate transcription, but sounds\
  \ more or less like the correct pronunciation in Flemish of the final part of the\
  \ name Vincent Van Gogh\u2014\u201CJames Joyce\u2014dat man is a fool!\u201D\n\n\
