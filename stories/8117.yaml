text: "Sebald's point, it seemed to me, was simple. That precision in writing fiction\u2014\
  especially in writing fiction\u2014is an absolutely fundamental value. He summed\
  \ up by saying that if you look carefully you can find problems in all writers,\
  \ or almost all (Kafka being an exception; especially, he told us, if you look at\
  \ the reports he wrote for the Workers\u2019 Accident Insurance Institute!).\nfrom\
  \ Luke Williams\u2019 essay \u201CA Watch on Each Wrist: Twelve Seminars with W.G.\
  \ Sebald\u201D, discussed, with excerpts, here.\n[2012-01-13]"
