text: "\nAlfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs. In 1963, he said: \u201CI'm frightened\
  \ of eggs, worse than frightened, they revolt me. That white round thing without\
  \ any holes\u2026 have you ever seen anything more revolting than an egg yolk breaking\
  \ and spilling its yellow liquid? Blood is jolly, red. But egg yolk is yellow, revolting.\
  \ I've never tasted it.\u201D This is what we can call a \u201Cfoolish fear\u201D\
  . After all, why should a rich and successful film director be scared of an egg?\n\
  There is nothing foolish, however, about a fear of eggheads. I do not mean \u201C\
  eggheads\u201D in the conventional sense, to denote extremely brainy persons and\
  \ boffins. To be terrified of that sort of egghead would be as foolish as to be\
  \ afraid of eggs. It is true that one might be frightened of a demented and power-crazed\
  \ egghead about to press the knob on the Doomsday machine, but that is a rare event,\
  \ and in general one is more likely to be scared by rampaging thicko barbarians\
  \ than by eggheads.\nThe egghead it is not foolish to fear is the literal egghead.\
  \ I mean, it is hard to imagine something genuinely more terrifying than a human\
  \ body with an egg where its head ought to be. Picture it\u2014a man or a woman,\
  \ of average height, average build, averagely dressed, but with a neck tapering\
  \ to a sort of eggcup formation, atop which rests an egg. Not some kind of giant\
  \ human head-sized egg, but a common chicken egg, of the kind one buys by the half\
  \ dozen in a carton. I don't know about you, but if I was sashaying along the boulevard\
  \ of an important city and came face to face with such an egghead, I would run away\
  \ screaming.\nWe are used to heads that have eyes and a nose and a mouth and ears.\
  \ However arrayed, fortuitously or in a somewhat lopsided manner, these are the\
  \ features we associate with what we understand as a head. Human heads deformed\
  \ by horrible accidents or mishaps at birth will still largely conform to a generic\
  \ headness, as do, in their own ways, the heads of beasts and birds. Some insect\
  \ heads, under a microscope, can appear alien and mildly alarming, but they retain\
  \ a set of recognisable features with which we can become familiar and accommodate\
  \ ourselves, particularly when we are reminded that they are grossly magnified and\
  \ really quite tiny.\nIt is the awful blankness of the egghead that is so unnerving\
  \ and ruinous to our sanity. That smooth, fragile shell, white or brown or sparsely\
  \ speckled, admits of no features whatsoever. We cannot, Mr Potatohead-like, poke\
  \ eyes and a nose and ears and a mouth in to it, for in so doing we would only crack\
  \ the shell. And not only is it an awful blank, but its size is out of proportion\
  \ to the body atop which it rests, somehow making it all the more frightening.\n\
  We must consider, too, that its smooth and featureless form robs it of senses. Without\
  \ eyes, it cannot see. Without a nose, it cannot smell. Without ears, it cannot\
  \ hear. Without a mouth, it cannot speak. Even if we allow that within the eerie\
  \ shell there may lurk a brain, that brain would be tiny in comparison to the human\
  \ brain, and, devoid of sensory stimulation, an unimaginable horror. In short, the\
  \ egghead would be akin to a zombie. It is truly the stuff of nightmares.\nI count\
  \ myself fortunate that I have never actually had a nightmare about eggheads. I\
  \ hope I never will. But it strikes me that they could well prompt nightmares in\
  \ others were they to be deployed in a blockbuster horror film. Attack Of The Eggheads\
  \ From Outer Space has a pleasingly 1950s ring to it. One imagines the spaceship\
  \ landing conveniently close to a major American city, and the eggheads rampaging\
  \ through the streets trailing chaos in their wake. Though it is unclear how a zombie-being\
  \ with an egg for a head might cause harm, other then by creating terror in those\
  \ who see it lumbering towards them on an otherwise uneventful sunny day.\nOne could,\
  \ alternatively, devise a film from the perhaps even more terrible perspective of\
  \ the egghead itself. Our hero goes to bed one night and wakes up in the morning\
  \ with an egg where his head used to be. This would be a suitable premise, not for\
  \ a horror film, but for a piece of mawkish pap starring, inevitably, Robin Williams.\
  \ Only he, I think, has the chops to make an audience weep at the plight of an egghead.\
  \ Indeed, he has the talent\u2014if one can call it that\u2014to make believable\
  \ a scene where the egghead itself weeps. But would its tears be yellow?\nThis brings\
  \ us back to Hitchcock. Had he not been such a scaredy cat about eggs, he would\
  \ surely have made the definitive egghead film, Eggheado, perhaps, or Eggheads By\
  \ Eggheads West or To Catch An Egghead or The Thirty-Nine Eggheads or Dial E For\
  \ Egghead or The Man Who Knew Too Many Eggheads or Eggheads On A Train or The Wrong\
  \ Egghead or Eggheadbound or The Egghead Vanishes or Shadow Of An Egghead or even\
  \ just The Eggheads. Hitchcock being Hitchcock, there would no doubt have been a\
  \ scene where Tippi Hedren gets splattered with egg yolk. Or would it be revealed\
  \ that her blonde hair is neither blonde nor hair, but an eruption of thin strings\
  \ of egg yolk from what, in a heart-thumpingly suspenseful scene, we discover is\
  \ not Tippi's human head at all, but\u2026 an egghead!\n[2012-03-30]"
