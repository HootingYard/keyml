text: "The following advert appeared in Exchange & Mart in 1936:\nUNLUCKY AT GAMBLING?\n\
  If so why not experiment by buying a pack of Surrealist Forecast Cards? Designed\
  \ by a famous mystic artist and author, they were originally intended as a joke,\
  \ but he found that they picked the winners in his case, and in many others. Can\
  \ be used for any race, anywhere, any year, and the same pack will last for years.\
  \ These cards are not guaranteed, as they re-act differently in the case of each\
  \ individual, but they do enable you to conduct an interesting and perhaps profitable\
  \ experiment with luck. Obviously, if they were infallible we would be so rich that\
  \ we wouldn't need to advertise them. So we make this very fair offer. Buy a pack\
  \ with full instructions for 5/-. If you find them to be of no use to you your money\
  \ will be refunded without question or argument.\nSURREALIST FORECAST CARDS,\n261,\
  \ Lauderdale Mansions, London, W.9\nThe \u201Cmystic artist and author\u201D was\
  \ Austin Osman Spare, and a rare photograph of a set of the cards (now worth considerably\
  \ more than 5/- or 25p) can be seen here.\n[2011-09-03]"
