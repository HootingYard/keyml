text: "How many ducks died under the ungainly boot of the infant Samuel Johnson? According\
  \ to Boswell, \u201CIt is told, that, when a child of three years old, he chanced\
  \ to tread upon a duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and killed it; upon which,\
  \ it is said, he dictated to his mother the following epitaph: \u2018Here lies good\
  \ Master Duck, / Whom Samuel Johnson trod on; / If it had lived, it had been good\
  \ luck, / For then we'd had an odd one.\u2019.\u201D\nBoswell tells the story only\
  \ to deny that it ever happened. \u201CThe anecdote of the duck,\u201D he writes,\
  \ has been \u201Cdisproved by internal and external evidence\u201D and \u201Cthe\
  \ truth of which I am to refute upon [Dr Johnson's] own authority\u201D. But is\
  \ he denying that his hero trod on a duck, or only that, having done so, the precocious\
  \ tiny extemporised a verse about the deed?\nBe that as it may, Boswell seems to\
  \ have misunderstood the original story. His source was Anna Seward, who heard it\u2014\
  repeatedly, it seems\u2014from Johnson's stepdaughter Lucy Porter, who in turn got\
  \ it from Johnson's mother. In this version, the three-year-old Johnson \u201Cmade\
  \ some verses on having killed, by treading on it, his eleventh duck\u201D. We can\
  \ construe this as suggesting that the future lexicographer had already stamped\
  \ upon ten ducks before memorialising the eleventh in verse.\nDo we believe Boswell\
  \ or Anna Seward? In Extraordinary People (1965), Hesketh Pearson notes that Boswell\
  \ \u201Chas given the impression, studiously adopted by other Johnsonians, that\
  \ Anna is not to be trusted. But she is quite as reliable as Boswell sober, and\
  \ more reliable than Boswell drunk\u201D.\nAnna Seward (1742\u20131809) was a poet,\
  \ admired by, among others, Sir Walter Scott, who, after her death, edited three\
  \ volumes of her works, although he confided to a friend that \u201Cmost of [it]\
  \ is absolutely execrable\u201D. Her journal and letters confirm her as one of the\
  \ great purple prose writers there has ever been. If she wanted to tell you there\
  \ were very few woodcocks to be seen, she would write \u201Cthe transmigratory gentry\
  \ of dusky pinion are great strangers here\u201D. She also wrote, of the dying days\
  \ of an acquaintance, \u201CThe intellectual torch wavered not, neither dimmed in\
  \ its earthly socket\u201D.\nI sincerely hope my own earthly socket lasts for a\
  \ good while yet, unlike the earthly socket of any poor Lichfield duck seeing the\
  \ approach of terrible tiny Samuel Johnson!\n[2010-08-11]"
