  \ and to chuck it into a lull during the conversation at one of those swish sophisticated\
  \ cocktail parties you are forever going to (and I am not).\n\nI have been accused\
  \ of relentlessly alluding to a single extract from the Journals of Gerard Manley\
  \ Hopkins\u2014the entry where he describes mesmerising a duck\u2014so here is another,\
  \ equally fascinating, quote:\nTuncks is a good name. Gerard Manley Tuncks. Pook\
