text: "You are a very sinister servant, Baines, said Lord Boggis, addressing, as he\
  \ thought, his manservant, Baines, By which I mean that, having brought me my muffin\
  \ and tap water at eleven o\u2019 clock on the dot, as instructed, you have been\
  \ dismissed, with a lordly gesture of my lordly arm, to return to the pantry or\
  \ to wherever it is you hold sway, in the bowels of this my mansion, there to go\
  \ about your duties, whatever they might be when you are outwith my presence, running\
  \ a tight ship, awaiting the sound of the bell which calls you back upstairs next\
  \ time I require your services. Yet, having been dismissed, you have not gone, but\
  \ are to be found lurking in the corner of the room, in shadow, barely visible,\
  \ betraying your presence by the faint outline of your frame and by the almost imperceptible\
  \ sound of your breathing which, if I deploy my ear-trumpet, I can hear, indubitably.\
  \ This behaviour is most untoward, and is quite likely to send me into a flap. When\
  \ you are dismissed, you should go. When you are summoned, you should come. I cannot\
  \ countenance this intermediate state, where you loiter, neither going nor coming,\
  \ hovering as it were, in an uncertain realm between tidy absolutes. Look, I have\
  \ not touched my muffin nor glugged my tap water, and it is ten past the hour. That\
  \ is evidence of my discombobulation. I cannot rest while you are standing there,\
  \ sinister in shadow. You have been in service in this my mansion for several decades,\
  \ Baines, and never before have I known you to fracture my peace in so unprecedented\
  \ a fashion. Even when you had that mishap with an icing sugar siphon pump attachment\
  \ and had to have a metal plate inserted in your skull, even then, and afterwards,\
  \ you carried out your duties with aplomb, and I had no complaints to make. Thus\
  \ I am baffled, baffled!, by your frankly bewildering conduct, or rather misconduct.\
  \ It may be that you have taken a loopy turn and will need to be carted off and\
  \ replaced by a brand new manservant, though how in heaven I am ever to find one\
  \ as reliable as you have been, until now, is quite beyond my wits to discover.\n\
  Lord Boggis prattled on, not realising that the sinister figure lurking in the shadows\
  \ was not his trusted servant Baines. It was the Grunty Man! and he was merely biding\
  \ his time before laying waste to the mansion and every person in it..\n[2014-05-13]"
