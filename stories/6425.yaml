text: 'Men do not, as a rule, use postscripts, and it is significant that artists
  and persons inclined toward the arts are much more given to postscripts than other
  kinds of men. One might almost say that women correspond by postscript; some of
  them put the subject of the letter in the postscript, as the scorpion keeps his
  poison in his tail. I have before me letters from Case 58, with two postscripts,
  and one extraordinary letter from Case 11, with four postscripts and a sentence
  written outside the envelope. This is the apogee of superficiality.
