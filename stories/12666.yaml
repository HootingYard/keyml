text: "\nChapter Seven of Mr Key's Bumper Book Of Birds, a work in progress.\nThe\
  \ cow is a type of bird. It is also known as the misprint bird, because by rights\
  \ there should be an r between the c and the o to make crow, an indubitable bird.\
  \ What has happened is that certain slapdash ornithological writers, who skimp on\
  \ proofreading, have given cow where they mean crow. The error is more common in\
  \ written than in verbal ornithology. In the latter, the varying pronunciations\
  \ of the letter o tend to alert even the most misty-brained bird expert to the difference.\n\
  In cow, the o is pronounced as in ow!, the exclamation you make when, for example,\
  \ a crow alights on your head and pecks at your scalp with its sharp fearsome beak\
  \ in order to gobble up the various little beetles and creepy-crawlies and breadcrumbs\
  \ scattered in your bouffant because you have not bothered to wash your hair for\
  \ several weeks.\nIn crow, on the other hand, the o is pronounced as in the surname\
  \ of Sebastian Coe, the high speed Olympic champion better known for his wrestling\
  \ bouts with William Hague MP in the gymnasium of the Houses of Parliament. Interestingly,\
  \ if we substitute the wrestler's initial C for a K, thus Koe, we arrive at the\
  \ Flemish word for cow. In that case, however, it is well to bear in mind that the\
  \ o in the Flemish koe is pronounced like the o in coo, which is the sound made\
  \ by doves and pigeons and various other birds.\nYou can see how this all hangs\
  \ together.\nOnly a nitwit would think a cow was actually a bird, as opposed to\
  \ being a misprint bird. Cows have neither beaks nor feathers nor wings nor talons.\
  \ Nor are they capable of flight. It is true that there is a nursery rhyme in which\
  \ a cow jumps over the moon, and that high leaping can in some circumstances be\
  \ mistaken for flying. It is possible that the rhyme was originally transcribed\
  \ by a slapdash ornithologist who skimped on proofreading, and what was meant was\
  \ \u201Cthe crow flew over the moon\u201D. Visually, you might see a crow flying\
  \ \u201Cover\u201D the moon depending on your angle of view, from your position\
  \ in a muddy field on earth in relation to both the cow\u2014oops!, the crow\u2014\
  and the moon. Though it is not often one sees a crow flying around the sky at night,\
  \ a time when most crows are fast asleep in their nests. Cows, on the other hand,\
  \ do not make nests. They sleep in byres.\n[2014-04-18]"
