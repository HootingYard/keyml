text: "A small error crept in to the piece Scenes From The Past Lives Of Tiny Enid,\
  \ where it was said that sixties psychedelic rocker Basil Groove had hung up his\
  \ plectrum. In fact, Basil Groove was the drummer in the band Turquoise Eye Of The\
  \ Lobster King, so it would be more accurate to say that he had stowed his drumsticks\
  \ in a cupboard.\nSoft-spoken and hairy, Basil Groove used to thump his drumkit\
  \ with gusto. To interviewers, he would quietly explain that \u201Cthe drums do\
  \ my talking for me\u201D. If that was really the case, it is very difficult to\
  \ know what Basil Groove wished to communicate, for his thumping could be skittish\
  \ and haphazard, as besuited a band given to twenty-minute bouts of noodling. Such\
  \ instrumental pieces were given titles of mythological resonance, often involving\
  \ wizards and dwarves and mist, but neither Basil Groove nor his bandmates had a\
  \ knack for writing lyrics. Instead they claimed to conjure up an atmosphere, and\
  \ wore ridiculous clothing.\nWhat made the band so compelling was the authenticity\
  \ of their sound. This was no accident. Basil Groove was taught to play the drums\
  \ by a genuine wizard, a figure as hairy as he with a long grey beard, who was accompanied\
  \ by a dwarvish assistant, both of them always enshrouded in mist. He first encountered\
  \ them while still a schoolboy, on his way home after a long afternoon of Latin\
  \ declension. Passing a cave, he was startled to see the wizard and the dwarf loitering\
  \ at its mouth, in mist. It was a no-smoking cave, and the eldritch figures were\
  \ taking a quick cigarette break. Seeing young Basil Groove, the dwarf began to\
  \ gibber in a high-pitched caterwaul.\n\u201CAs it is destined, here he comes! The\
  \ boy we'll teach to play the drums! Not yet as hairy as he'll be, but wait and\
  \ see! Wait and see!\u201D\nAnd then the dwarf pounced upon the boy and dragged\
  \ him into the cave.\nBasil Groove emerged five years later, grown and hairy and\
  \ possessed of an idiosyncratic drumming technique. On the very same day, he answered\
  \ an advertisement in the underground newspaper Felix Dennis\u2019 Capitalist Truncheon\
  \ and joined the Turquoise Eye Of The Lobster King. The age of groovy noodling was\
  \ upon us.\nIt was a golden age, whose memory we treasure, when hairy men's music\
  \ gave us such pleasure. They were groovy and fab and their beards were so wild.\
  \ When they noodled their noodles we were all beguiled.\n[2009-01-20]"
