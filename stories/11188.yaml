text: "\u201CBehold the socks of the mighty!\u201D\nThese were the words I heard declaimed\
  \ in my dreams, in the moment before waking on a windy winter's morn. It was later,\
  \ as I was scoffing breakfast (eggs, plus a surfeit of lampreys), that I realised\
  \ their significance. I slapped my forehead and went to retrieve, from the cupboard\
  \ under the sink, my battered tin crown. The time had come to stake my claim to\
  \ the Iron Throne. I would reign o'er the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros!\nFirst of\
  \ all, of course, I would have to eliminate all the other pretenders to the Throne,\
  \ of whom there were many. Oh!, many, so many, I had not thought death had undone\
  \ so many. But for all the corpses piled up along the pathway to the Throne, there\
  \ yet remained innumerable claimants who were very much alive, alive and in brutish\
  \ good health, and heavily armed, and of psychotic temperament. If I was going to\
  \ take my rightful place sitting on that Throne, with my bauble and sceptre, I was\
  \ going to have my work cut out.\nWhat I needed was a troop of minions. The presence\
  \ of minions lends a kingly air even to the weediest of Throne-claimants. Straight\
  \ after breakfast, then, I popped to the newsagent's to pick up the latest issue\
  \ of the directory or register or whatever it is, that invaluable publication which\
  \ lists, in alphabetical order, with contact details, and accompanied by skilful\
  \ line-drawings with much cross-hatching done in a spidery pen, all minions currently\
  \ available for hire. Sitting on a municipal park bench, buffeted by the wild winds,\
  \ I leafed through the lists and plumped for the Minions Of The Pointy Sticks. Alas,\
  \ on closer inspection, this turned out to be \u201Ca knitting group composed of\
  \ some wild and crazy folks\u201D. The last thing you want in a minion is wildness\
  \ or craziness. Rather, what you are looking for is slavish devotion, slobbering,\
  \ and a propensity for violence. Being armed with a pointy stick is a definite advantage,\
  \ which is why I had been initially attracted to the knitting group. In the event,\
  \ I picked some other minions from the directory, and gave them, as their first\
  \ task, the foraging from forests of sticks, and the sharpening of those sticks,\
  \ until they were pointy.\nI accomplished all this while still sitting on the park\
  \ bench. The wind, as I said, was wild. Wild was the wind, and I heard the sound\
  \ of mandolins. The sound grew louder, and I realised that, across the park, on\
  \ the other side of a swan-mad lake, came the approaching forces of a pretender\
  \ to the Iron Throne. It may have been Stannis Baratheon, or possibly Balon Greyjoy.\
  \ Whichever one it was, his army was strumming frantically at mandolins, playing,\
  \ I think, \u201CListen, The Snow Is Falling\u201D by Yoko Ono, which I recognised\
  \ as the B-side of \u201CHappy Xmas (War Is Over)\u201D, recorded with that Beatle\
  \ she married.\n\u201CHa!\u201D, I thought to myself, or rather spoke aloud, in\
  \ a kingly way, knowing my minions would hang on my every word, whether it made\
  \ any sense or not, \u201CThis puny pretender's army sings of the snow falling.\
  \ Windy it may be, and wild may be that wind, but snowfall there is not, not here.\
  \ As any fule kno, snow falls far north of here, by the Wall. Clearly the army is\
  \ geographically obtuse and disorientated. They will be easy prey, particularly\
  \ as they are armed only with stringed instruments.\u201D\nAnd then I issued a command\
  \ to my minions, ordering them to rush at the pretender's nincompoop army, and poke\
  \ at them with their newly-sharpened pointy sticks. Thus was the scene set for what\
  \ history books would call the Battle of Blister Lane Municipal Park. We routed\
  \ the enemy, and I was one step closer to the Iron Throne. It was time for lunch.\n\
  I headed off to a nearby stable, tore the heart out of a living horse, and gobbled\
  \ it down while it was throbbing and hot and bloody. Unfortunately there were no\
  \ barbaric Dothraki present to witness this gustatory feat. We are not all as media-savvy\
  \ as the Khaleesi, who had the cameras present during her own horse-heart-eating\
  \ lunch scene. But I was not troubled by her, far away in the Red Wastes with her\
  \ grunting savages and baby dragons. Other claimants to the Throne had to be dealt\
  \ with first, not least Robb Stark.\nIt was at this point I realised the knitting\
  \ group could be of use to me after all. Who would dare to stop me, I reasoned,\
  \ if I came bashing upon the city gates of King's Landing wearing a pair of socks\
  \ emblazoned with a knitted motif of the Black Bat of Harrenhal? Truly, so attired,\
  \ would I walk in the socks of the mighty!\nSo cheered was I by this thought that\
  \ I took my minions to the tavern for some celebratory carousing. It was only mid-afternoon,\
  \ but they had acquitted themselves well, and were deserving of reward. Little did\
  \ I know that, shortly before we fetched up at that snug rustic hostelry, the Unreconstructed\
  \ Stalinist, creeping away from it in his asp-like way was Petyr Baelish, the Lanisters\u2019\
  \ Machiavel. He had dripped poison into the ear of the taverner, and the taverner\
  \ in turn dripped poison into our flagons of grog!\nBy teatime, my minions lay sprawled\
  \ in the sawdust dead and dying, and I myself was so sick I could barely bring myself\
  \ to scoff a second horse-heart for dinner. But I forced it down, and set off alone\
  \ for the castle wherein the Minions Of The Pointy Sticks did their knitting. But\
  \ in my weakened state, I became hopelessly lost. Lost, too, is my memory of what\
  \ happened. All I can remember (I remember) is standing by the Wall. The guns shot\
  \ above our heads, and we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall).\
  \ Who was I kissing? Why, a Minion Of The Pointy Sticks, a knitwoman who had rescued\
  \ me from a ditch somewhere along the way, and had brought me to the Wall.\nAnd\
  \ it is here at the Wall I have stayed. I no longer stake my claim to the Iron Throne.\
  \ I am happy here, fighting off wolves and wildlings, listening to the falling snow,\
  \ while my knitwoman, the Minion Of The Pointy Sticks, knits me sock after sock\
  \ after sock after sock, each emblazoned with a motif of the Black Bat of Harrenhal.\
  \ I am no king, but I trudge through snowdeep in the socks of the mighty!\n[2013-03-26]"
