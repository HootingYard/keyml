text: "I have to say this not writing lark is curiously seductive. My trip abroad,\
  \ followed by a period of feeling like death warmed up, has led to a sort of unplanned\
  \ holiday from Hooting Yard and indeed from Het Internet generally. After bashing\
  \ out three hundred and twenty essays in three hundred and twenty days, not to mention\
  \ a myriad of other postages, it is with some relief that I have refrained from\
  \ tippy-tapping sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose.\nHowever, this does mean\
  \ that I have failed to impart to you much decisive information, without which you\
  \ are probably wandering the earth lost, twitching and shattered. I am thinking,\
  \ for example, of a recent dream, in the course of which I attended a party at a\
  \ retirement home for outrageous old thespians of the Donald Sinden stripe. One\
  \ of these ageing hams was swaddled from head to foot in cloth of the deepest crimson,\
  \ bemoaning that he had devoted his life to interpreting a minor character in a\
  \ minor work by a minor dramatist. We then gathered for a screening of In Search\
  \ Of The Most Pious Man\_: A Life Of Jesus, a film directed by Carrington Holmes.\n\
  I have tried, in my waking hours, to discover more about the dream film and the\
  \ dream film director, to no avail. It seems neither of them actually exists. They\
  \ ought to.\n[2012-12-12]"
