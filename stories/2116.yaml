text: "The Rev. Dr Opimian\u2014Why, Lord Michin Malicho, Lord Facing-both-ways, and\
  \ two or three other arch-quacks, have taken to merry-andrewising in a new arena,\
  \ which they call the Science of Pantopragmatics, and they have bitten Lord Curryfin\
  \ into tumbling with them; but the mania will subside when the weather grows cool\u2026\
  \nMiss Gryll \u2013 But pray, doctor, what is this new science?\nThe Rev. Dr Opimian\u2014\
  Why that, Miss Gryll, I cannot well make out. I have asked several professors of\
  \ the science, and have got nothing in return but some fine varieties of rigmarole,\
  \ of which I can make neither head nor tail. It seems to be a real art of talking\
  \ about an imaginary art of teaching every man his own business. Nothing practical\
  \ comes of it, and, indeed, so much the better\u2026 Like most other science, it\
  \ resolves itself into lecturing, lecturing, lecturing, about all sorts of matters,\
  \ relevant and irrelevant; one enormous bore prating about jurisprudence, another\
  \ about statistics, another about education, and so forth; the crambe repetita of\
  \ the same rubbish, which has already been served up \u201Ctwi\xEBs hot and twi\xEB\
  s cold\u201D, as at many other associations nicknamed scientific\u2026\n[Lord Curryfin]\
  \ had been caught by the science of pantopragmatics, and firmly believed for a time,\
  \ that a scientific organisation for teaching everybody everything, would cure all\
  \ the evils of society.\n\_\nThomas Love Peacock, Gryll Grange (1860)\n[2009-03-23]"
