text: "\u201CSpasms (kraempfe) are an affection to which almost all sensitives are\
  \ especially inclined. Many, especially those of a higher degree, suffer from them\
  \ severely. They form the last term of the series\u2014stomach-ache, head-ache,\
  \ fainting, spasm. They may be occasioned by magnets, by terrestrial magnetism,\
  \ by poles of crystals, by amorphous, unipolar, bodies, either odo-positive or odo-negative,\
  \ by human odic poles, by the prismatic rays of either the solar or lunar spectrum,\
  \ particularly the green rays, by down passes, but oftener by up passes, by charging\
  \ and conduction, whether immediate or approximative, by the mere odic atmosphere,\
  \ by the psychical action of insult, grief, anxiety, fear, annoyance, jealousy,\
  \ quarrels, mental exertion, joy, or even dreams. They are most conspicuous in the\
  \ extremities, solar plexus, and head. They can be artificially excited and calmed,\
  \ or depart naturally. They often follow a tolerably similar course from the toes\
  \ through the abdomen to the brain, and thence down the spinal cord, like a pass.\
  \ In most cases they can be more or less easily calmed by down passes. Hence as\
  \ they are essentially related to sensitiveness, and immediately dependent on odic\
  \ motions, they undoubtedly belong to the domain of od.\u201D\nFrom Reichenbach\
