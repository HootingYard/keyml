text: "MR KEY goes to see DR FANG, a wholly imaginary expert in the field of distempers\
  \ and maladies of the cranium.\nDR FANG\u2014Good afternoon, Mr Key, and what brings\
  \ you to my consulting room on this fine day of overcast skies and drizzle?\nMR\
  \ KEY\u2014I suffer greatly, Dr Fang, greatly!\nDR FANG\u2014Plop yourself onto\
  \ that ergonomic beanbag and unburden yourself of your sorrows, Mr Key. I am all\
  \ ears.\nMR KEY\u2014I am experiencing a debilitating attack of vacancy-between-the-ears,\
  \ Dr Fang. It is as if my brain is empty.\nDR FANG\u2014You have suffered such symptoms\
  \ before, I think, Mr Key, if I am not mistaken.\nMR KEY\u2014Indeed I have, Dr\
  \ Fang. Whereas usually my brain can be relied upon to emit fumous babblings which\
  \ I then, via a keyboard, tippytap on to what our Belgian chums call Het Internet,\
  \ now I find myself staring like a mongoose into a vacuum.\nDR FANG\u2014Hold that\
  \ thought, Mr Key, hold that thought. I am not sure it means anything, which could\
  \ be a sign of your distemper and malady of the cranium, the field in which I am,\
  \ as you know, an expert, albeit a wholly imaginary one.\nMR KEY\u2014Yes, Dr Fang,\
  \ that is why I have come to see you.\nDR FANG\u2014A sound decision, if I may say\
  \ so, Mr Key. What you must understand is that even an empty cranium can eject or\
  \ spurt forth mighty prose, or babblings, whichever term one prefers.\nMR KEY\u2014\
  But how can that be, Dr Fang?\nDR FANG\u2014Do not forget, Mr Key, that though your\
  \ head be empty, like the Basket of Saint Dymphna, much, oh! much has gushed from\
  \ it heretofore, if I am using the word heretofore correctly. Thus, for example,\
  \ only recently from within your cranial integuments there burst forth a rather\
  \ amusing bagatelle about Robert Fripp and his wife and his sister and the bard\
  \ Sinfield. You recall it, do you not?\nMR KEY\u2014Yes, yes I do!\nDR FANG\u2014\
  Well then, Mr Key, what could be simpler than to let brew in your brain something\
  \ inspired by another titan of prog? To pluck a name at random, how about Ian Anderson?\
  \ Could you not consider the gestation of a piece where the Jethro Tull frontman\
  \ is, let us say, invited to give the keynote speech at the annual convention of\
  \ the Association Of Flautists Who Stand Upon One Leg While Tootling?\nMR KEY\u2014\
  Well\u2026 I suppose I could, Dr Fang.\nDR FANG\u2014Do not just suppose, Mr Key,\
  \ do! Act! As Father Hopkins said, Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride,\
  \ plume, here Buckle!\nMR KEY\u2014You are right, Dr Fang. I shall indeed Buckle!,\
  \ as in Buckle down to the task.\nDR FANG\u2014That's the spirit! Now haul yourself\
  \ up from my ergonomic beanbag and get ye hence! Ian Anderson won't write that keynote\
  \ speech himself.\nMR KEY\u2014Thank you so much for your help, Dr Fang.\nOutside,\
  \ the skies were still overcast, and the drizzle still spat. MR KEY made his imaginary\
  \ way homeward, past ditches and puddles and bracken and muck. As Anderson sang,\
  \ more than forty years ago, it was a new day yesterday, but it's an old day now.\
  \ How true that was, in a very real sense, how true\u2026\n[2011-08-23]"
