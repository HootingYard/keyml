  \ advent calendar very much and have dutifully been printing out the pictures and\
  \ pasting them with glue to a sheet of cardboard, as you recommend. May I make a\
  \ request? For many years I have been absolutely fascinated by the Wobbling Virgin\
  \ of Ballinspittle, and I think she would make a fine addition to the calendar.\n\
  It's a nice idea, but getting a snap of the Wobbling Virgin actually in the act\
  \ of wobbling has proved impossible. Instead, I hope Ms Nisbet, and indeed all of\
  \ you, will make do with the equally splendid Our Lady of the Arctic Wastes.\n\n\

  \ yoot I had some friends who comprised a BVM (Blessed Virgin Mary) SWAT team. Their\
  \ mission being to regularly move a very heavy concrete statue, under cover of darkness\
  \ and from place to place, so that when the chosen households looked out their morning\
  \ windows THERE she was. A miracle. They sustained quite a few injuries in the course\
  \ of this project.\u201D\n[2011-12-11]"
