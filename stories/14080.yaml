  \ the Royal Academy at the weekend. Meanwhile, reviewing the show in The Spectator,\
  \ Martin Gayford tells us:\nCornell \u2026 was one of the few ever to ruffle [Marcel]\
  \ Duchamp's philosophical cool. At their first meeting, or so the story goes, they\
  \ discussed the topography of central Paris in enormous detail, building by building\u2014\
  and in French\u2014Cornell mentioning casually only afterwards that he had never\
  \ visited the city. Duchamp was lost for words.\nCornell spent his entire life on\
  \ Utopia Parkway in New York, and never travelled further than Maine.\n[2015-07-06]"
