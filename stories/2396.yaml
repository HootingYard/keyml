text: "I bought a loaf of bread. I tore a chunk from it and shoved the chunk into\
  \ my head. From my head it went down to my belly. But I wanted it to go to my brain.\
  \ I imagine my brain is of the same consistency as a chunk of bread. I think of\
  \ my head as a breadbin. Thereagain, maybe my brain is more like a lump of dough.\
  \ You don't keep dough in a breadbin. You keep it in a sack. You hang the sack on\
  \ a hook in your pantry. Whenever you need some dough, you open the sack and take\
  \ out a handful. Then you close up the sack. So maybe my head is more like a sack\
  \ on a hook in a pantry. It's lucky that my pantry is lit by a bright electric bulb,\
  \ a bare bulb, of illegal wattage, without a shade. And I took the pantry door off\
  \ its hinges. I left the hinges in place, nailed to the frame, without purpose.\
  \ But visible, and buffed every day, with a rag.\xC2\_\n[2009-05-01]"
