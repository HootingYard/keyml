text: "There was a delightful juxtaposition of words in the Grauniad cryptic crossword\
  \ a couple of weeks ago, where\u2014when solved\u2014one column down read FAIRY\
  \ STATIONER. This set me to thinking about fairies and their stationery. For one\
  \ wild moment I wondered if the Cottingley fairies had been affixed to their positions\
  \ with staples, given that Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths took their photographs\
  \ in 1917 and the home stapling machine had been patented by Henry Heyl forty years\
  \ before, in 1877. But then I slapped my forehead and remembered that of course\
  \ the girls had used hat-pins.\nWould a fairy have any use for staples at all? Or,\
  \ indeed, for any kind of stationery other than scented notepaper and a ballpoint\
  \ pen with which to write fairy messages to other fairies, and to such humans as\
  \ possess the gift, or curse, whichsoever it may be, of being able to communicate\
  \ with fairy folk? I can imagine these fey flighty bewinged sprites perhaps using\
  \ treasury tags to fasten together into a sprig the stalks of daisies or campions\
  \ or buttercups, but surely more robust stationery items such as hole-punches would\
  \ be too heavy for them to lift? Or is it the case that fairies are deceptively\
  \ strong, and can use their fairy powers to move, if not mountains, then entire\
  \ cartons of thick black heavy duty marker pens?\nIt would be intriguing, upon a\
  \ ramble through a dingly dell, to stumble upon a tiny little shop with a sign outside\
  \ it saying FAIRY STATIONER, just as in the crossword. Then one could crouch and\
  \ poke one's head in the window and make a quick visual inventory to ascertain which\
  \ items of stationery are commonly used by fairies, and which are not.\n\nThe Cottingley\
  \ Fairies\_: hat-pins, not staples\n[2011-09-13]"
