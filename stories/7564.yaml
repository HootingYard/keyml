  \ the Hooting Yard Treasury of Song. This is of course a plug or puff for next week's\
  \ Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose, attendance at which ought to be\
  \ compulsory for all devotees of Hooting Yard but is, alas, in these namby pamby\
  \ wishy washy twee days o\u2019 pap merely voluntary. That said, you really are\
  \ urged to strain every sinew to cobble together a fiver, to foregather upon Tower\
  \ Bridge, and then to head more or less in a straight line southwards down Tower\
  \ Bridge Road until you reach Bermondsey Square, wherein you will find Woolfson\
  \ & Tay Bookshop/Gallery/Cafe, wherein, at 7.00 PM on Friday 18 November, Mr Key\
  \ & Mr Spaceman will be providing a woopdy doopdy extravaganza of lugube \u2018\
  n\u2019 lop.\n\n[2011-11-11]"
