text: "In a comment on Peewit Patrol, yesterday, Dave asks about my use of the phrase\
  \ \u201Crunning like the clappers\u201D. The clappers referred to are those of bells,\
  \ which strike the inner surface of the bell to create that clang we know and love\
  \ and occasionally stuff cotton wool in our ears to muffle.\nIf it is argued that\
  \ the clappers of bells do not run, nor trot, nor scamper, all I can offer in my\
  \ defence is that the phrase, meaning \u201Cto go very fast\u201D, seems to have\
  \ originated with Royal Air Force public school chaps during the second world war.\
  \ The OED cites Eric Partridge's (not Peewit's, note) A Dictionary of Forces\u2019\
  \ Slang 1939\u201345 (Secker & Warburg 1948). Further citations suggest that it\
  \ can rain like the clappers, and that one can both surrender and go to work like\
  \ the clappers, so running towards a spinney for an initiation ceremony in the moonlight\
  \ seems equally viable.\nIt should be noted that the bells the clappers of which\
  \ go so very fast are specified by Partridge (not Peewit) as the bells of hell.\
  \ It so happens that Dobson, the titanic out of print pamphleteer of the last century,\
  \ devoted one of his pamphlets to this very subject. Fanatical Hooting Yardists\
  \ may recall this piece, originally posted five long years ago, in the dying days\
  \ of the Brown administration:\nThe bells of hell do not ring, says Theophrastus\
  \ Dogend, they clank and clunk, eternally, awfully, deafeningly. This is because\
  \ they are battered and broken, with great cracks and fissures. He adds that they\
  \ are covered in mould, of stinking greeny-grey.\nThere are no bells in hell, we\
  \ are told by Pilupus Taxifor. He says the clanks and clunks are the din of infernal\
  \ machinery, engines of havoc, designed to torment the damned. If there be stinking\
  \ mould upon the machines he does not say.\nWhile Optrex Gibbus maintains there\
  \ are precisely ten thousand bells in hell, each of them numbered, each in its own\
  \ belfry, and they are rung by sinners, in expiation, the bell-pulls in the form\
  \ of vipers, which bite the sinners\u2019 hands and wrists each time they peal their\
  \ designated bell.\nDobson's pamphlet Hell, Its Bells (out of print) is an attempt\
  \ to untangle the contradictions in these authorities, each of which, he contends,\
  \ has at least a grain of truth. Are there bells in hell, he asks, or are there\
  \ not? If there are, do they ring or do they clank? And clunk? Are there ten thousand\
  \ bells, or fewer, or more, even an infinity of bells, just as there is an infinity\
  \ of pits and dungeons and oubliettes in which the damned languish forever?\nThe\
  \ pamphleteer's research for this paper, which he read aloud at a meeting of the\
  \ Sawdust Bridge Platform Debating Initiative on the tenth of April 1954, led him\
  \ up some pretty horrible pathways, pathways more abhorrent even than the one that\
  \ runs parallel to the disgusting canal wherein the vomit of generations has collected.\
  \ Why it is that drunks and those with stomach disorders have habitually seen fit\
  \ to throw up their guts in a canal basin at the end of a long and twisting lane\
  \ far from any clinics and hostelries is a mystery Dobson never investigated, so\
  \ far as we know. But he was spellbound by the bells of hell, upon which, he believed,\
  \ so much, so very very much, hinged. It is a pity he never got round to writing\
  \ the follow-up pamphlet, Hell, Its Bells, And All That Hinges Upon Them, With Lots\
  \ Of Details, a work which exists only in the form of illegible scribblings in a\
  \ notebook half of which is burned and the remaining half smeared with a stinking\
  \ greeny-grey goo, which might be mould scraped from the bells of hell, but might\
  \ on the other hand just be the sort of goo that Dobson managed to attract to himself,\
  \ in his wanderings, God knows how.\nHooting Yard Encyclopaedia topics addressed\_\
