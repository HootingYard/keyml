text: 'Another thing that happened when I was trudging around the autumnally glum
  seaside resort was that I received an unsolicited pancake hint. I had stopped to
  tighten a loose shoelace, near an ice cream kiosk. The kiosk was shut, it being
  blustery and cloud-louring and out of season. A biddy with a demented number of
  bags passed me by, stopped, and turned just as I was straightening up from my shoelace-tying
  exertions. In a mournful voice, she offered me a pancake hint, then went on her
  way.

  This was not the first time I had been given a pancake hint at a seaside resort,
  and as I headed off towards the steep steps up to a lawn and a crazy golf facility,
  I cast my mind back to an earlier occasion. It was a different seaside resort, and
  a different pancake hint, but the weather was similar, and so, curiously, was the
  biddy, though this previous biddy had fewer bags about her person and we were nowhere
  near an ice cream kiosk.

  That made two seaside-based pancake hints. You might think the making of pancakes
  is a simple matter and that I have been given two hints too many, but I disagree.
  Whenever I make pancakes I like to mull over the hints I have received, both that
  pair of seaside ones and other pancake hints given in wholly different circumstances,
  far inland. I would not claim always to act upon the hints, for I think we all tend
  towards our own habitual pancake-making techniques without really giving them much
  thought. Dobson was a glorious exception. He never made his pancakes in the same
  way twice. He would take a conscious pause as he approached his skillet, and summon
  to mind one of the numberless pancake hints stored in his throbbing cranium. How
  he selected the hint he was about to use is the subject of one of his most engaging
  pamphlets, On The Judicious And Non-Repeating Deployment Of Pancake Hints (out of
  print). Intriguingly, Dobson mentions in a footnote (page 9) that he also received
  one of his pancake hints at the seaside, though maddeningly he does not inform the
  reader at which resort. Mind you, nor have I, and in my case there are two seaside
  resorts you will be thumping your forehead against a solid panel in frustration
  that I have failed to divulge. But one day I plan to write my own pancake pamphlet,
  a sort of hommage to Dobson''s, and until then I am keeping mum.
