text: "We have already learned how one can guarantee a tea party free of monkey divertisements\
  \ by the simple expedient of dangling, on the end of a length of string suspended\
  \ from the ceiling over the centre of the tea table, a large sugarlump. And we have\
  \ seen that this tactic has the additional advantage of preventing the guests from\
  \ putting their brains in their pockets.\nBut let us say we are contrary sorts who\
  \ wish, at tea parties, to encourage both monkey divertisements and the placing\
  \ of brains in pockets. Is it sufficient, in such a case, merely to snip the dangling\
  \ string, with a pair of scissors, and to chuck the piece to which the gargantuan\
  \ sugarlump is attached into a waste bin, or to secrete it in a drawer?\nWould that\
  \ it were so straightforward! Alas, at tea parties as in life, there is a freight\
  \ of woe before we may bask unburdened in Elysium (cf. Grimes). By all means remove\
  \ the string and the sugarlump, but do not expect at once to find monkeys cavorting\
  \ around the tea table, nor your guests to pluck their brains out of their skulls\
  \ and place them in their pockets. More needs to be done.\nFirst, you are advised\
  \ to hire the services of a monkey feng shui consultant. I hasten to add that this\
  \ is a person who has expertise in feng shui for monkeys, not a monkey who knows\
  \ about feng shui. Several poor raddled souls of my acquaintance have plumped for\
  \ the latter, and in due course lost the shirts off their backs, and a lot more.\
  \ A generation ago, punks used to parrot the line \u201CNever trust a hippy\u201D\
  , and, echoing them, one could well add \u201CNor a monkey who claims credentials\
  \ in the ancient Chinese system of aesthetics believed to use the laws of Heaven\
  \ and Earth to improve one's life by receiving positive qi\u201D. Certainly that\
  \ is a mantra some extremely astute ex-punk-persons recite daily (cf. Savage).\n\
  To attract monkeys to create divertisements among the cakes and tea-strainers at\
  \ your tea party, you will have to create the right conditions for them, and this\
  \ is where a qualified monkey feng shui consultant proves a boon. They tend to charge\
  \ quite high fees, and rarely accept payment in nuts, so be warned that your tea\
  \ party overheads will be steep. By \u201Coverheads\u201D I do not mean the string\
  \ affixed to the ceiling, because you have already deposited that in a bin or drawer,\
  \ along with the massive sugarlump dangling from it.\nPlease, please, give the consultant\
  \ free rein, no matter how abstruse or ridiculous a kerfuffle they kick up. Qi is\
  \ volatile stuff, a bit like ectoplasm, and monkey qi particularly so. Clinics up\
  \ and down the land are filled with persons who came a cropper thinking they could\
  \ dismiss their monkey feng shui consultant half way through his or her shenanigans\
  \ and finish off the job themselves. No, just let them get on with it. Your parlour\
  \ will look like the wreck of the Hesperus by the time they have completed their\
  \ work, and your wallet be empty, but monkeys of all sorts will beat a path to your\
  \ door come teatime.\nPersuading your guests to put their brains into their pockets\
  \ is a task yet more challenging. In this case, there are, as far as I know, no\
  \ consultants to consult. You must go it alone. Do not make the childish error of\
  \ leaving, on the sideboard, a trepanning drill, and hoping for the best. I am sick\
  \ and tired of explaining that boring a hole in the skull is utterly inadequate\
  \ if one wishes for complete removal of the brain (cf. Felix). You will need a saw.\
  \ Actually, unless you have top of the range disinfectant facilities, you will need\
  \ as many saws as you have tea party guests. The last thing you want, as your guests\
  \ sip tea poured from a majestic Delft teapot, ornamented with paintings of fat\
  \ little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses tending pigs, and monkeys jump and swing\
  \ and shriek and otherwise provide divertisements, is to have a troop of inspectors\
  \ from the neighbourhood skullsaw hygiene community support hub bashing the door\
  \ down and halting the tea party on grounds of by-law infraction. And they will,\
  \ they will, believe you me.\nIt pays to ensure that each guest is partnered by\
  \ an intimate acquaintance, that is, a person whom they will trust to saw through\
  \ the top of their skull in readiness for brain removal. If such pairings prove\
  \ impossible in advance, you will need to devise some ice-breaking party games before\
  \ everyone sits down to tea. Try playing Fumbling With Mother's Brooch, Poke The\
  \ Pin In The Sheet Of Cardboard, or Catholic Persecution, each of which is guaranteed\
  \ to wholly obliterate shyness or social unease.\nYou also need to provide each\
  \ guest with an overgarment, to be worn over their stylish tea party apparel. It\
  \ is unlikely that any of them will attend already dressed in something with pockets\
  \ of suitable size or lining. Study a scale model of a brain and compare it with\
  \ the size of an average pocket and you will understand what I am saying. The nature\
  \ of the pocket's lining is equally important, and those of the overgarments you\
  \ distribute among the guests ought to be of satin, or of a fabric equally rich\
  \ and smooth. Remember the brain, in all its miraculous complexity, is but a fragile\
  \ thing (cf. Finch) and while resting in the pocket must be cosseted.\nIt is wise\
  \ to make some preparations for the replacement of the brains within the skulls\
  \ at the end of the tea party. Here, I very much recommend that you first shoo the\
  \ monkeys out of the way. To avoid any brain being plopped into the wrong skull,\
  \ with untoward consequences, each one ought to be marked with a symbol, and an\
  \ identical symbol imprinted on the forehead of the corresponding brain's owner.\
  \ You can use a magic marker for this. If you are not gifted with the ability to\
  \ draw startling and memorable symbolic forms, the monkey feng shui consultant probably\
  \ is, though they will charge extra for doing so. The symbols should also be marked\
  \ upon the sawed-off portions of head, for obvious reasons. To guard against future\
  \ dislodgement, once the brains are back within the crania and the tops of the skulls\
  \ are resting on the correct heads, use glue or some sort of industrial welding\
  \ equipment to fix them firmly in place.\nAs soon as the last guest has waved goodbye\
  \ from the porch, you may wish to retrieve the string with its gigantic sugarlump\
  \ appendage, and hang it once again from the ceiling. This will keep those monkeys\
  \ at bay, so you can have a well-earned nap.\nNext week, we will look in more detail\
  \ at the fat little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses, and the pigs they tend, both\
  \ as teapot decoration and in brute reality.\n[2010-05-27]"
