text: "\u201CTo be clear, Merced does not want to sacrifice a goat in his home. He\
  \ wants to sacrifice 5\u20137 goats, 1\u20132 turtles, 1 duck, 10\u201314 chickens,\
  \ 5\u20137 guinea hens and 10\u201314 doves all at one time. Keeping and killing\
  \ that many animals in a residential neighbourhood poses disease transmission dangers.\
  \ It creates stench and filth\u201D\u2026 Furthermore, said the lawyer for Euless\
  \ council, sacrificing goats was \u201Crepulsive and has no place in an urban environment\u201D\
  .\nI find myself particularly concerned for that lone duck.\nHeresy Corner investigates\
  \ the world o\u2019 goat sacrifice. Food for thought not only for Santerian voodooists,\
  \ but for Aztec fundamentalists and those of us who worship the hideous bat-god\
  \ Fatso.\n[2009-08-03]"
