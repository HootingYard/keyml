text: "Eerie old barn, wherein I lay sprawled,\n  The farm that it stands on, what\
  \ is it called?\n  It goes by the name of Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard.\n  There, you\
  \ see, that was not so hard.\n  But other questions we might raise\n  In these squalid,\
  \ sordid days\n  In this eerie barn of woe\n  Have answers we will never know.\n\
