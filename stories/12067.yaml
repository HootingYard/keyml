text: "Further archival witterings, again from long ago in 2004. This was said to\
  \ come from a collection called The Vitamin B Pirate Gang & Other Maritime Doggerel\
  \ by Gervase Beerpint, presumably some relation to your favourite poet and mine,\
  \ Dennis Beerpint.\nChaps oozing charm wedged in a chest.\n  There's no knowing\
  \ who'll come out best.\n  One is called Billy, head made of cork,\n  Shoulders\
  \ cast iron, arms and legs chalk.\n  Mythology enwraps him like a shroud.\n  His\
  \ voice is grating and horribly loud.\n  And then there is Cedric, aquatic, with\
  \ fins.\n  He likes to muck about with a box of pins.\n  He has no ears but his\
  \ feet are huge.\n  His entire head is covered in rouge.\n  Hummingbirds pain him,\
  \ as do owls.\n  He's always had trouble pronouncing vowels.\n  The third of our\
  \ trio is Swivel-Eyed Dan.\n  His head is the shape of a frying pan.\n  He once\
  \ went south, looking for bees,\n  But all his dreams blew away on a breeze.\n \
  \ You have to give credit where it's due \u2013\n  But not to Dan when he's dribbling\
  \ goo.\n  Three of them, then, wedged in a chest,\n  Each one wearing a red satin\
  \ vest,\n  Oozing insouciance, polish, and charm.\n  Let us hope they come to no\
  \ harm.\n  But the chest has been stowed in the hold of a ship\n  Whose captain\
  \ is moody and curls his lip.\n  As they sail out from port, the captain growls:\n\
  \  \u201CDamn the beakers! Damm the owls!\n  Damn the crackers! Damn the flaps!\n\
  \  Damn the chest of charming chaps!\u201D\n  Two hours later, the ship just sank,\n\
  \  And all that remained was a single plank.\n  It floated for weeks and was then\
  \ washed ashore.\n  I found it on the beach and used it for a door.\n  So when you\
  \ come to my stinking hut,\n  Bringing some food for my stinking mutt,\n  Go careful\
  \ by the door and remember your prayers:\n  \u201CGet wedged in a chest, he who\
  \ dares\u201D.\n[2013-10-13]"
