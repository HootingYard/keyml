  \ the firebrand Marxist-Leninist composer and author of Stockhausen Serves Imperialism,\
  \ who once threw Yoko Ono out of his house, was Brian Cornelius Cardew. Why did\
  \ he drop the Brian? It seems a far more \u201Cproletarian\u201D name than Cornelius,\
  \ so one would have thought he would embrace it. As Wilcox\u2014a non-Brian\u2014\
