text: 'A person with pimples sat on a bench spitting into a beaker. In the park, in
  the park at dusk. I stood on the lawn and shouted at him through a loudhailer, and
  birds fled their perches on branches of trees in the park at dusk. The dog that
  belonged to the person with pimples was pissing against a tree. I shouted at the
  dog. One bird stayed on its perch on a branch. It was looking straight at me. The
  bird was looking straight at me. I dropped the loudhailer and turned and walked
  off the lawn on to a path in the park at dusk. A red loudhailer on a green lawn,
  and a person with pimples spitting into a beaker and a pissing dog and a bird on
  a branch. I turned my back on them and walked away along the path in the park and
  somewhere in the distance I heard bells clanging, dusk bells clanging, and I headed
  towards them, towards the bells clanging, out through the gates of the park and
  across the railway bridge and past the allotments and the clanging bells grew louder
  and night fell on my town. The blanket of night. It muffles our rage. The bells
  stop clanging. Muffled, muffled.
