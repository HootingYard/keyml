text: "\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a devotee of Hooting Yard is\
  \ equally a fan of \u201960s beat combo Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, known\
  \ to Bernard Levin as The Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. That being so, readers\
  \ will be palpitating with overexcitement at the news that\u2014at long last!\u2014\
  a tribute band has been formed to recreate, as closely as possible, the authentic\
  \ sound of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich-style poptasticness.\nBut this is\
  \ no mere tribute band. It is a supergroup, and a multi-disciplinary one at that,\
  \ drawing in not just musicians but sports stars, politicians, and statesmen from\
  \ around the world. Thus we have the Ivory Coast footballer Yaya Tour\xE9; the avant\
  \ garde octogenarian and widow of (in the immortal words of Kenneth Williams) \u201C\
  that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman\u201D, Yoko Ono; the Paris-born American\
  \ cellist Yo-Yo Ma; and the Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Binyamin Netanyahu,\
  \ known affectionately as \u201CBibi\u201D.\nThe group\u2014Yaya, Yoko, Yo-Yo, Tzipi\
  \ & Bibi\u2014are not yet on tour, nor in the recording studio. In fact they have\
  \ not yet met up with each other to rehearse such timeless classic hits as \u201C\
  Margareta Lidman\u201D, \u201CHe's A Raver,\u201D and \u201CThe Wreck Of The \u2018\
  Antoinette\u2019\u201D. It is my fond hope that, reading this press release, each\
  \ of the five will realise the urgency of making this happen. The future of pop\
  \ music is in their hands.\nADDENDUM\_: Dave Dee and his pals graced these pages\
  \ back in October 2010, when they encountered a bricklaying witch.\n[2017-11-29]"
