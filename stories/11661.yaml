text: "Bartleby the Scrivener, from Herman Melville's 1853 story of that name, is\
  \ one of the most numinous characters in literature. Though fictional, he has always\
  \ seemed to me to be a role model, a man to emulate if we wish to live a better\
  \ life. Handily, for those of us seeking to Be Bartleby, the estimable John Ptak\
  \ at Ptak Science Books has gathered into a single list all the separate utterances\
  \ of our hero. Armed with the list, we can confine our own speech to the words and\
  \ phrases spoken by the scrivener. Note how splendidly appropriate they are to almost\
  \ every conceivable situation.\n\u201CI would prefer not to.\u201D\n\u201CI would\
