text: 'For last night''s performance with Lepke B. at the Resonance104.4FM tenth birthday
  bash, I designated an area of the room as the mosh pit, for young persons to commandeer
  and do whatever it is young persons do in mosh pits. This shows, I think, that I
  have my finger on the pulse and have due regard to my audience.

  I was taking my lead from that titanic twentieth-century pamphleteer Dobson, whose
  own mosh pit travails were recounted last year.
