text: "Coal all spent; the bucket empty; the shovel useless; the stove breathing out\
  \ cold; the room freezing; the trees outside the window rigid, covered with rime;\
  \ the sky a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it. As I did, foolishly.\
  \ I shoved open the door of the chalet, and steeped out, and stared at the sky.\n\
  \u201CAidez-moi! Aidez-moi!\u201D, I shouted. There was no answer. I went back inside\
  \ and slammed the door shut. Before I froze to death, I put on two coats, made from\
  \ the fur of critically endangered medium-size mammals, which I had stolen from\
  \ Yoko Ono. Physically, I am a good deal bigger than diminutive Yoko, hence the\
  \ two coats. Ideally, I would have pilfered three, but the Beatle Lennon was mooching\
  \ about the place, and I had to act fast. That was a long time ago. In those days\
  \ I did not shout at the sky in French.\nThat skill, or art, I learned more recently,\
  \ from Bl\xF6tzmann. \u201CThose seeking succour from the sky,\u201D he writes (Book\
  \ XIX, Lavender Series), \u201CAre well advised to note that the sky speaks French,\
  \ with a smattering of Finnish (verbs only).\u201D\nI know there are those who damn\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmann as a crank and an idiot, but to date I have found him an infallible\
  \ guide, in spite of the often senseless tosh he peddles. I say \u201Cto date\u201D\
  \ because now even I am beginning to have doubts. It was, after all, because of\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmann (Book IX, Lilac Series) that I ended up here, in a chalet high, high\
  \ in the ice mountains, with an empty coal-bucket and icicles forming on my moustache.\n\
  Should I have treated the invitation with a measure of caution? Probably. But, immersed\
  \ as I was in the tenets expounded in Book IX, I did not even question it. Instead,\
  \ I shoved a few essentials into a pippy bag and ran\u2014sprinted!\u2014to the\
  \ railway station. I was in such a hurry that I did not even lock the door behind\
  \ me. Within hours I was at the foot of the ice mountains, queuing for a ticket\
  \ for the funicular railway which would take me to this confounded ice-girt freezing\
  \ coalless chalet.\nThe invitation came from the Pointy Town Nisbet Spotting Society,\
  \ an organisation previously unknown to me.\nDear Shambeko!, it read, Please join\
  \ us for a very special week of nisbet spotting high, high in the ice mountains.\
  \ Be our guest in a lovely chalet heated by a coal-stove. Brr! It's chilly out there,\
  \ so wrap up warm!\nAs I say, it might have been wise to make a few enquiries before\
  \ rushing off and leaving behind everything I held dear. Not only had I never heard\
  \ of the Pointy Town Nisbet Spotting Society, I had no idea what a nisbet was. How,\
  \ then, could I spot one? And if I did spot one, or dozens, or hundreds, I would\
  \ not realise I had done so, not knowing what one was. Dashing off to the chalet\
  \ was the utmost foolishness on my part. The best I can say in my defence is that\
  \ I assumed a representative of the Society would be there to enlighten me.\nBut\
  \ when I arrived, the chalet was empty. There was a small amount of coal in the\
  \ bucket, so I got the stove burning, heated up a pan of milk slops, and sat gazing\
  \ at the rime-encrusted window. And I waited. I waited for three days, until the\
  \ coal was almost spent. Then, with a sudden crash, the door burst open, and a woman\
  \ festooned with the pelts of various hairy mammals came waltzing in.\nI was astonished\
  \ to see Pointy Town's most notorious flapper, Flossie Von Straubenzee. She raised\
  \ one bemittened fist and cried \u201CDeath to the fascist insect that preys upon\
  \ the life of the people!\u201D Flossie had once been a member of the Symbionese\
  \ Liberation Army, and still liked to shout their slogan in greeting.\n\u201CThank\
  \ St Spivack you are here!\u201D I babbled, \u201CThe bucket of coal is almost spent,\
  \ there are very few milk slops left, and according to the Daily Ice Mountains News\
  \ Digest & Weather Forecast, dropped by parachute to the chalet each morning, it's\
  \ going to be twice as cold tomorrow, thrice as cold the day after, and so on, exponentially.\u201D\
  \nFlossie seemed unperturbed, and asked me how the nisbet spotting was going. Somewhat\
  \ shamefacedly, I explained that I did not know what a nisbet was.\n\u201CWell,\
  \ nor do we, exactly,\u201D she said, \u201CThat's one reason for this very special\
  \ week. We're hoping that you might accomplish the very first authenticated spotting\
  \ of a nisbet. That would really give the Society a boost. I came to tell you that\
  \ we've just had word there could be a nisbet higher up the ice mountains. Apparently\
  \ they don't thrive except right near the summit, where the air is thin and the\
  \ cold is bitter, or bitterer. Good luck! Cheerio!\u201D\nAnd Flossie waltzed out\
  \ of the chalet as suddenly as she had come.\nThat was three days ago. Now, all\
  \ the coal is spent. The bucket is empty. The shovel is useless. The stove is breathing\
  \ out cold. Et cetera et cetera. The sky offered no succour. But I have devised\
  \ a plan. The bucket is large enough for me to squat inside it, just about. I drag\
  \ it outside, and, using knots both sturdy and ingenious, attach it to the cords\
  \ of one of the morning parachutes lying in the snow. Then I climb into the bucket.\
  \ Soon, as I expected, a flock of wing\xE8d things, with beaks and feathers\u2014\
  probably birds\u2014grasp the parachute in their talons, and lift it. The knots\
  \ hold. I am lifted too, in my bucket.\n\u201CLet us go and spot a nisbet!\u201D\
  \ I cry.\nAnd with that I ascend into the regions of the ice mountains and am lost\
  \ forever.\nThe first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by\
  \ Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-02-17]"
