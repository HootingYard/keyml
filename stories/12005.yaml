  \ a comment arrives. Rahul tells us that he (she?) is \u201Cusing one of the best\
  \ refrigerators in India\u201D. Apparently it is fitted with the \u201Clatest sensation\
  \ technology\u201D. It is not clear if this is related to L'Oreal's light-reflecting\
  \ booster technology, but I am sure it must be so.\nThe refrigerator alluded to\
  \ in my postage was the one in Michael Tippett's kitchen which he called \u201C\
  Bernard Levin\u201D. I cannot help wondering if that model, too, had the most up\
  \ to date sensation technology of its era. Again, I would like to think that was\
  \ the case.\nI do not know what Tippett's fellow composer Peter Maxwell Davies calls\
  \ his refrigerator, but no doubt it, too, is a state of the art model, crammed with\
  \ electrocuted swans.\n[2013-09-24]"
