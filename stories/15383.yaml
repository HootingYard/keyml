  \ How can I become a tiptop sporting champion? If anyone can give me a top tip,\
  \ it is you!\u201D\nActually, it is not me you need to ask, but Hooting Yard's tiptop\
  \ sports correspondent Fatima Gilliblat. This is what she has to say:\nThe best\
  \ way to become a tiptop sporting champion is to ensure you were born on 23 March.\
  \ It was on this day of the year that champs such as Roger Bannister, Mo Farah,\
  \ Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny, Steve Redgrave, and the bobsleighing Olympian Shelley\
  \ Rudman dropped from their mothers\u2019 wombs, as did the cricketer Mike Atherton\
  \ and the pugilist Joe Calzaghe. If you were born on any other day, I am afraid\
  \ that the road to sporting glory will be steep and pitiless and you will almost\
  \ certainly fail.\n[2017-03-25]"
