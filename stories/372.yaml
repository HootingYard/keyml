text: "Last week, the Guardian newspaper was giving away a seies of poetry pamphlets.\
  \ There were selections from T S Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Philip Larkin, among others,\
  \ but I was dismayed to note that they did not include Dennis Beerpint.\nThe twee\
  \ versifier has been rather quiet of late, so I was pleased to learn that a new\
  \ book is in the works. For the last year, apparently, Beerpint has been busy with\
  \ a project entitled Imperfectly-Remembered Mitteleuropean Folk Songs In Translation.\
  \ He has collected at least four or five examples, enough for a characteristically\
  \ slim volume of verse.\nUnder cover of darkness, Pansy Cradledew smashed her way\
  \ into Beerpint's so-called \u201Cpoetry hut\u201D and managed to steal Gestetnered\
  \ copies of a couple of the pieces, so we can give readers a sneak preview. The\
  \ first is called \u201CThe Shepherd's Lament\u201D:\nThere is a shepherd in the\
  \ hills / There is a [something] green / But black is the crow in the [something]\
  \ tree / And lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd's lass has golden hair / She\
  \ [something something] milk / But the crow has flown away, my love / And the ducks\
  \ have left the lake.\nMarvellous. And here is the second one, which seems to be\
  \ untitled:\nAs I roamed the bosky verdance / Upon a summer morning / [Something\
  \ something] gravel pits / And O my love was [something]. / Entwined in posies [something\
  \ something] / I heard the sound of gunfire / Then [something] over by the cowshed\
  \ / Upon a summer morning. / Tra la la and fol de rol / The geese are all a-[something]\
  \ / My pig has got his hat on / And I'll see you in the gloaming.\nFantastic. I\
  \ expect the editor of the Guardian will be kicking himself that he neglected to\
  \ include Dennis Beerpint in the series.\n[2008-03-21]"
