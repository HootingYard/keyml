text: "\nIn The Dabbler this week, I reproduce part of an instruction manual from\
  \ the Frank Key Academy of Terpsichorean \xC9lan. I am afraid to say that a pre-publication\
  \ reader for The Dabbler, employed to vet all contributions, contacted me a few\
  \ days ago and had the gall to call into question my qualifications for running\
  \ such an academy.\nDear Mr Key, he wrote, on laughably self-important \u201CDabbler\
  \ Pre-Publication Vetting Protocol\u201D headed notepaper, Much as we admire your\
  \ pratings, we must strain every sinew to protect our readers from charlatanry,\
  \ poppycock, and flapdoodle. If, for example, we were to run a piece on the Black\
  \ Bat of Harrenhal, we would entrust the commission to a writer fully conversant\
  \ with the career of Ser Oswell Whent, not to some booby. These are important and\
  \ serious matters, after all. That being so, I cannot help wondering why in the\
  \ name of all that is holy you presume to lecture our readers on the art of dance,\
  \ when it is blindingly obvious that you could not dance your way out of a paper\
  \ bag. Yes, Mr Key! Before I took up my current post with The Dabbler I was an official\
  \ observer at the Pointy Town Paper Bag Danceathon, and well do I recall the pitiful\
  \ figure you cut, for six or seven hours, as you failed to make your escape from\
  \ the paper bag by dint of the twist, the hoo-cha, the Watusi, and the peasants\u2019\
  \ reel, turn and turn about. I am afraid that wild horses would not drag me into\
  \ the unconscionable position of passing your piece for publication.\nAs it happens,\
  \ that last sentence was an idle boast. Upon receipt of this pompous cant, I hi-ho'ed\
  \ over to Dabbler HQ with a harras of wild horses in tow. Wild? They were savage,\
  \ almost demonic. We soon got the matter settled, and I doubt I shall be hearing\
  \ from that little twerp in future.\n[2011-07-01]"
