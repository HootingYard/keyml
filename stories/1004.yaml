text: "This piece first appeared in April 2006.\nPrince Fulgencio had a heart of stone\
  \ and his palace was a palace exceeding glum. No, no, it was not a palace, it was\
  \ a castle, turreted and towered, with many flags and banners flying, every one\
  \ of them showing blasphemous heraldic devices. All sorts of abominations featured\
  \ on those flags, from unicorns with five legs to many-headed hydra, from fiery\
  \ basilisks to crows whose heads were back to front.\nThe Prince's henchmen patrolled\
  \ the castle battlements through every hour of day and night, armed with swords\
  \ and daggers and blunderbusses and glue guns and pipes from which to blow poisoned\
  \ darts. Woe betide any interloper who made an unauthorised landing on the helipad!\
  \ They would be immediately surrounded, overpowered, and delivered to Prince Fulgencio's\
  \ deepest dungeons, and their \u2018copter smashed to smithereens. The Prince was\
  \ proud of his guards, who were the most devoted and violent in the land, as well\
  \ as the fittest. They were each given regular breaks from duty to take part in\
  \ bio-ching\_sessions. In addition, the Prince ensured they were all given a copy\
  \ of his book\_Henchmen Are From Mars, Damsels Are From A Girly Planet, which they\
  \ were expected to memorise. No one could argue that the henchmen did not have a\
  \ martial bearing, clanking around in their armour, shouting their heads off, and\
  \ generally being intimidating.\nWhat they lacked, however, was entertainment. Prince\
  \ Fulgencio himself did not understand fun, humour, nor high jinks, for his time\
  \ on earth was spent exclusively in plotting dark and terrible deeds. He was alert,\
  \ however, to unrest among his myrmidons, and it was clear that something would\
  \ have to be done to appease them. He had a spy, or creature, like Bosola in\_The\
  \ Duchess Of Malfi, who mingled incognito among the henchmen to discover what secrets\
  \ lurked in their foul and treacherous hearts. The spy was called George Kaplan\
  \ (a name later borrowed by screenwriter Ernest Lehman for the non-existent agent\
  \ in\_Hitchcock's North By Northwest), and he reported to the Prince as follows:\n\
  Kaplan\_\u2013 The henchmen are becoming restive, O Prince.\nFulgencio\_\u2013 Then\
  \ I shall have each of them put to death and replaced by other henchmen.\nKaplan\_\
  \u2013 If I might say so, an unwise decision, O Prince, for though restive, your\
  \ henchmen are fanatically loyal to you and I know not where you might find their\
  \ like elsewhere.\nFulgencio\_\u2013 From Mars, of course! Have you not read my\
  \ book?\nKaplan\_\u2013 I have indeed, O Prince, many a time, but\u2014and I tread\
  \ delicately here\u2014though you are omnipotent and wise and princely, your helicopter\
  \ is not equipped to journey through space as far as other planetoids, much as you\
  \ might wish it.\nFulgencio\_\u2013 God blast the stars!\nKaplan\_\u2013 I am sure\
  \ He will, O Prince. Meanwhile, I think that if you bring to the castle a fool or\
  \ jester, an entertainer in cap and bells, the henchmen will be placated.\nPrince\
  \ Fulgencio's face assumed a curdled cast, but he was pragmatic. Dismissing George\
  \ Kaplan with a wave of his fat and pasty hand, he sat down at his metal tapping\
  \ machine and sent an advert to the classified section of the\_Daily Manacle.\n\
  Wanted. Fool for amusement of henchmen,\_it read,\_You will be responsible for devising,\
  \ implementing and evaluating a core strategy for tomfoolery and japes, consulting\
  \ with stakeholders, and demonstrating a proactive approach. The successful candidate\
  \ will have a proven track record in delivering merrymaking within a goal-oriented\
  \ environment. The Prince is working towards a castle which reflects the diversity\
  \ of his earthly domain.\nOn the day of the interviews, Prince Fulgencio was sick\
  \ with an attack of the seeds and bindings, so he delegated George Kaplan to weed\
  \ out the chaff. Being a duplicitious knave, the spy appointed as jester a man named\
  \ Selwyn Pob, a lugubrious cripple of downcast air and abject gloom. And thus it\
  \ was that, upon hearing Pob's dirges and threnodies, delivered while dragging himself\
  \ around the castle on his worm-eaten crutches, the henchmen's unrest turned to\
  \ open rebellion, and they hacked Prince Fulgencio to pieces with their hatchets\
  \ as he lay groaning in his sickbed, and his blood and gore were splattered upon\
  \ the walls, and there, in the shadows, George Kaplan smiled, and went creeping\
  \ down to the pantries, where he gorged himself on cake and buns and pies and pastries\
  \ and custard, until he was replete.\n[2008-11-29]"
