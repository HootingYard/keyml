text: "[Voiceover:] Previously, on Maud. Having refused to go into the garden with\
  \ a cad, Maud has taken a draft of laudanum. On waking, she is disturbed by a knocking\
  \ at her door. The visitor is a person from Porlock, come on business\u2026.\n\u201C\
  Good heavens, sir. By the evidence of the number 666 tattooed on your scalp and\
  \ that hint of horns, one might think you are the very devil himself, come from\
  \ hell by way of Porlock. Are you indeed Beelzebub, and if so, what do you want\
  \ with me?\u201D\n\u201CI compliment you on your perspicacity, madam. Or do I mean\
  \ perspicuity? Whichever it may be, I am, as you adjudge, the devil incarnate. But\
  \ if you do not think it unforgivably ill-mannered, I shall put my Homburg back\
  \ on my head, so you will not be unduly distracted by those demonic signs atop my\
  \ cranium. We shall be better able to conduct our business if you are not goggling\
  \ wide-eyed all the while above my eye-line.\u201D\n\u201CThe many and various manuals\
  \ of etiquette weighing down my bookshelves, of some of which I am myself the authoress,\
  \ are unanimous in declaring that it is most improper for a gentleman to wear a\
  \ hat indoors, especially in the presence of a lady. Howso that may be, you can\
  \ hardly be regarded as a gentleman, in light of your admission that you hail from\
  \ the infernal realm of darkness. Do, please, put your hat back on. I would ring\
  \ for tea and cucumber sandwiches were it not that my slovenly yet devoted maidservant,\
  \ Baines, is collapsed insensible against the wainscot in my sitting-room, having\
  \ taken an unconscionable dosage of laudanum earlier. I would hope that she will\
  \ be up and about within the hour, if you have patience.\u201D\n\u201CIt might surprise\
  \ you just how patient I can be, madam. Millennia have passed since this, our present\
  \ appointment, was inscribed in my day-book by my recording demon.\u201D\n\u201C\
  It occurs to me, sir, that had I succumbed to the blandishments of the cad and gone\
  \ with him into the garden, there to stroll and engage in a chaste yet tingling\
  \ embrace in a verdant arbour, you would have come a-knocking at my door in vain.\
  \ Had I been in the garden, I would not have heard your rat-a-tat. About Baines,\
  \ you know. There is no doubt a lesson to me there, but one which I fear it is too\
  \ late for me to digest. You will assert, I suppose, that once our encounter was\
  \ written down in your day-book or appointments diary, whether yesterday or millennia\
  \ ago, it was fated to happen, and no imaginable circumstance could have prevented\
  \ it, certainly not a cad's blandishments.\u201D\n\u201CThat is correct, madam.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI find myself frantic with irritation, then, that my resistance to the cad\
  \ was not of my making, not an inner strength belying my status as a fragile and\
  \ neurasthenic specimen of the weaker sex, but merely the playing out of cosmic\
  \ forces quite beyond my control. I ought to clarify that my irritation is with\
  \ myself, not with you. Of you I am rightly terrified, and I wait with tremulous\
  \ palpitations to learn what business brings you here.\u201D\n\u201CAll in good\
  \ time, madam. Porlock is a goodly distance from your bungalow, and though I be\
  \ the devil I am yet prey to the aches and pains brought on by an arduous hike across\
  \ the windswept moors. The promised refreshments of tea and cucumber sandwiches\
  \ will thus be more than welcome, when Baines awakes from her daze.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Hark! I hear clattering and groaning which, if my ears do not deceive me, are the\
  \ sounds of Baines regaining consciousness. I shall go at once to give her instructions.\
  \ Wait there, sir.\u201D\n\u201CIn the temporary absence of the lady of the house,\
  \ or rather bungalow, I muse to myself aloud. Why, I wonder, did she not ring for\
  \ her maidservant, using the broken and clunking yet effective bell installed for\
  \ that purpose? It is true she may have lost her wits in my foul and damnable presence.\
  \ Most people do. But it seems passing strange that she should lose her wits so\
  \ irrevocably that she neglects, or forgets, the manners and mores of civilised\
  \ society, and in going to her maidservant, rather than the other way about, risks\
  \ bringing the social order crashing to the ground. Eek!\u201D\n\u201CWell may you\
  \ say \u2018Eek!\u2019, Beelzebub! Your confidence in your own demonic power is\
  \ severely misplaced. As you are now all too well aware, I have not lost my wits.\
  \ If anything, they are heightened. Thus it was that I was able to devise the stratagem\
  \ of leaving the room to fetch Baines, when instead I fetched these heavy iron chains\
  \ and crept in through a different door, behind you. It was the work of a moment\
  \ to bind you, helplessly, in the chains, using the element of surprise. There will\
  \ be neither tea nor cucumber sandwiches for you. When Baines wakes, the two of\
  \ us together will drag you down into the cellar, where you will languish in the\
  \ darkness, nibbled by rats, until such time as I decide what to do with you. I\
  \ may hand you over to the cad, for sport. Or perhaps Baines will wish to have you\
  \ help out in the kitchen, as a skivvy. We shall see. For the time being, I shall\
  \ take your unholy pack of Tarot cards and stuff them into your mouth, depriving\
  \ you of the ability to utter fiendish spells and abracadabras which might loosen\
  \ the chains that bind you. I must say you have inadvertently provided a most amusing\
  \ diversion in my otherwise tedious and uneventful day.\u201D\n\u201CBut, madam,\
  \ I implore you\u2014gaah!\u201D\nTo be continued\u2026\n[2012-04-10]"
