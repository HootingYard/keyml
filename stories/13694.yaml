text: "I am very much looking forward to the new 26-part television drama The Stealthy\
  \ Chump, which begins next week. Previews have not been available, but a few details\
  \ have been leaked to the press. Very few, actually\u2014the title, the number of\
  \ episodes, and the basic premise. I have told you the first two, so let me now\
  \ move on, wings unfurled, to the third.\nThe Stealthy Chump centres around a chump\
  \ who is stealthy. Each week, the chump tries to use his talent for stealthiness\
  \ in some way, for example creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark, or lurking\
  \ next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare, or taking part in a jewel heist.\
  \ But, as the series title indicates, while he is indubitably stealthy, he is also\
  \ a chump. Being a chump, each week he manages to sabotage his own stealthiness\
  \ by making the sort of idiotic decision only a dyed in the wool chump would make.\
  \ So, when creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark he carries with him a box\
  \ of fireworks which, through cackhandedness with a box of matches, he manages to\
  \ ignite all at once, thus drawing attention to himself with lots of sparkly whizzes\
  \ and bangs. When lurking next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare, he\
  \ wears a hat with a giant propeller on it, and the wind picks up and spins the\
  \ propeller blades around and the stealthy chump finds himself hovering a few feet\
  \ off the ground, making passers-by gawp. When taking part in a jewel heist, he\
  \ carries a box of fireworks and wears his propeller-hat at the same time, with\
  \ predictable results.\nI hope I have not given the impression that The Stealthy\
  \ Chump is a comedy. On the contrary, by all accounts it is the sort of drama invariably\
  \ described as \u201Cgritty\u201D. What this means is that it is set in the north\
  \ of England where the rainfall is incessant, several characters scowl and swear\
  \ a lot, and nobody ever smiles\u2014not even the stealthy chump himself.\nI suggested\
  \ above that the title character was dyed in the wool, and this is literally the\
  \ case. Each week, the stealthy chump wears an item of knitwear, and the dye that\
  \ has been used to colour the wool has also coloured the stealthy chump from head\
  \ to toe. As all his knitwear is dyed in brash and gaudy blues and pinks and yellows,\
  \ the fact that his head is the same colour means he finds it even more difficult\
  \ to be inconspicuous and stealthy, and is thus even more of a chump.\nThe Stealthy\
  \ Chump was filmed entirely on location in a municipal car park. No animals were\
  \ harmed in the making of the series, except for some ants and beetles and other\
  \ creepy-crawlies, and an unfortunate trumpeter swan that was in the wrong place\
  \ at the wrong time.\n[2015-01-18]"
