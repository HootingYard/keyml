text: "According to J Edgar Hoover in his 1958 book Masters Of Deceit, \u201CFarmers\
  \ In The Coalition\u201D is a \u201Ctypical\u201D title of the kind of Mimeographed\
  \ pamphlet issued to Communist study groups in the United States during the 1950s.\
  \ \u201CWritten in a simple style and slanted to the average reader\u201D, these\
  \ publications were used in the \u201Cslow and gradual\u201D process of indoctrination\
  \ that turned previously patriotic Americans into slavish devotees of a Godless\
  \ ideology.\n\u201CFarmers In The Coalition\u201D is also the title of a pamphlet\
  \ issued by Old Farmer Frack last year, shortly after Cameron \u2018n\u2019 Clegg's\
  \ sun-splattered appearance in the Downing Street garden to announce the formation\
  \ of the coalition government. Though it is Gestetnered rather than Mimeographed\u2014\
  a small yet important distinction\u2014the mad old farmer's tract is as doctrinaire\
  \ and as sinister as any screed aimed at the malleable brains of American fellow-travellers\
  \ half a century ago.\nWritten in an incoherent style and slanted to the deranged\
  \ reader, the 2010 edition of \u201CFarmers In The Coalition\u201D ought more accurately\
  \ be called \u201CCows In The Coalition\u201D, for Old Farmer Frack presents the\
  \ case for a number of his bellowing herd to be granted senior positions in the\
  \ new regime.\n\u201CAt this critical juncture in our national story,\u201D he writes,\
  \ in one of his few coherent passages, \u201CNothing can be more important than\
  \ that my cows are installed in the great offices of state, from Home Secretary\
  \ to Foreign Secretary, from Postmaster General to Keeper of the Privy Purse.\u201D\
  \nCynics and conspiracy theorists will suspect that the cows thus empowered would\
  \ be mere puppets, put in place to further the nefarious, if befuddled, aims of\
  \ Old Farmer Frack himself. Not so, he argues.\nThose who claim that the cows thus\
  \ empowered would be mere puppets, put in place to further the nefarious, if befuddled,\
  \ aims I myself harbour within my curdled black worm-riddled heart could not be\
  \ more wrong! Caligula, who made his horse a consul, is a much-misunderstood Roman\
  \ Emperor, and one for whom I have a soft spot in my curdled black worm-riddled\
  \ heart. I will be proud to follow in his wake. I will do all in my power to make\
  \ sure that when my cow Binky is made Postmaster General, she will lick all the\
  \ stamps in the land herself, with her rough tongue and copious cow-spittle. Then\
  \ you shall see real change, of the kind these politicians are always prattling\
  \ on about.\nOld Farmer Frack is less forthcoming about the changes to be ushered\
  \ in by his other cows, in other ministries. But it hardly matters. In time-honoured\
  \ fashion, the evil Tories and the hapless Liberal Democrats have crushed beneath\
  \ their boots the inspiring revolutionary vanguard represented by the mad old farmer\
  \ and his bellowing cows. Undaunted, he is thought to be working on a new pamphlet,\
  \ entitled \u201COther Farmers With Other Cows In Other Coalitions, A Sweeping Historical\
  \ Perspective\u201D.\n[2011-05-02]"
