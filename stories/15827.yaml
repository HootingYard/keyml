text: "\nWell, there you go\_: that was Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning.\
  \ It was a curious experience retyping something I'd written almost a quarter of\
  \ a century ago. Chief among my torments was the desire to tweak, rephrase, rewrite.\
  \ But I knew that if I started along that path, I'd end up with a considerably different\
  \ text. On a very few occasions, I could not resist. (For example, a misuse of the\
  \ word fulsome. I know this is now routinely misused, to the point where its proper\
  \ meaning is likely to be lost, but damn me if I'm going to help it on its way.)\
  \ When, like Lars Talc, I am long dead, scholars of the future will no doubt pore\
  \ over this version and the original, triumphantly spotting the minor changes.\n\
  That original was published in an edition of twenty-five copies in 1994. This new\
  \ one is available free of charge to billions of readers across the globe. That\
  \ is the cataclysmic change that occurred between the time I finished Obsequies,\
  \ and descended into my Wilderness Years, and when I emerged from them, in the new\
  \ century, to find that Het Internet had happened, and this website came mewling\
  \ into existence. It is instructive that the actual number of my readers probably\
  \ hasn't increased significantly.\nAnother change, implicit in the text, and one\
  \ I could not help but notice, is that my twentieth-century characters like to glug\
  \ booze. (Even more so in the other novella written as the demons of debauch gripped\
  \ me, later published as Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars.) There\
  \ is not a drop of aerated lettucewater to be found!\nLars Talc and Minnie seem\
  \ to be ur-versions of Dobson and Marigold Chew. However, the character I most warmed\
  \ to, as I retyped, was the mysterious Bruno. It is never made clear precisely who\
  \ he is, nor the nature of his relationship to Talc and Minnie. I suspect he may\
  \ be worthy of a spin-off series of tales.\nCertain passages were lifted without\
  \ acknowledgement from The Little Cyclopaedia Of Common Things by Rev. Sir George\
  \ W. Cox, Bart., M.A. (1894), the Journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins, and (if memory\
  \ serves) Death, Ritual, and Bereavement, edited by Ralph Houlbrooke (1989).\nI\
  \ may republish Obsequies in a near-facsimile edition via Lulu. In the meantime,\
  \ you may feel compelled to recognise my titanic retyping efforts by plopping some\
  \ moolah into the Donation box.\n[2017-10-28]"
