text: "The out of print pamphleteer Dobson's diary, sixty years ago today:\nI embarked\
  \ on my research into sewage farm gnomes by rereading, and rerereading, the article\
  \ in The Listener about a buff-breasted sandpiper. It was a pity, I thought, that\
  \ no illustration accompanied the piece. Elsewhere in the same issue, the editor\
  \ found room for a picture of masks in an article about masks. This exasperated\
  \ me so much that I threw my new pencil sharpener, bought this morning to replace\
  \ the one mislaid yesterday, out of the window and into a puddle. Why on earth the\
  \ window was wide open on a day as inclement as this is a surpassing mystery, or\
  \ it would be had Marigold Chew not embraced some hare-brained fresh-air fad. I\
  \ hope she soon diverts her attention to something less chilly and windswept.\n\n\
  Anyway, it seems quite obvious to me that everybody knows what a mask is, and we\
  \ do not need a photograph to aid our understanding, whereas I doubt there are many\
  \ persons with the vaguest clue about buff-breasted sandpipers. A picture would\
  \ have helped. I was going to fire off a stern letter packed with invective to the\
  \ editor of The Listener, but having chucked my pencil sharpener out of the window,\
  \ and my pencil being ruinously blunt, and there being no spare pencils to be found\
  \ anywhere, I was at a loss, and in any case, leafing through The Listener to locate\
  \ the wholly unnecessary picture of a mask, so I could refer to the page number\
  \ in my irate letter, I happened upon the piece about a buff-breasted sandpiper\
  \ again, and paused to reread it for the umpteenth time, and it was then I was struck\
  \ by a previously overlooked detail.\nR S R Fitter begins his piece \u201CI found\
  \ myself at a large sewage farm\u2026\u201D A large sewage farm. Now, though I know\
  \ very little about gnomes, I do know that they are small, or reputed to be small.\
  \ Would small gnomes be likely to farm a large sewage farm? I thought it more likely\
  \ that gnomes would be found at a small sewage farm, one of a size appropriate to\
  \ their smallness. Thus even at this early stage I was making progress in my research,\
  \ for my conclusion seemed inarguable. At a stroke, I had whittled down the number\
  \ of sewage farms at which gnomes might be found. I resolved to obtain a map and\
  \ a thick black marker pen with which to expunge all large and medium sized sewage\
  \ farms, leaving only the smaller ones visible. That should keep me gainfully occupied\
  \ for a while at least. I have high hopes for the pamphlet which will eventually\
  \ result!\nAnother thing I need to do, when I have the means to sharpen my pencil\
  \ and thus write a letter, is to send a query to R S R Fitter, c/o The Listener.\
  \ I am intrigued by that phrase \u201CI found myself at\u2026\u201D It is as if\
  \ Mr Fitter woke from a deep sleep, or perhaps a trance or a coma, and \u201Cfound\
  \ himself\u201D at the sewage farm, as opposed to where he might have expected to\
  \ be, at home for example, or in a familiar snackbar. I want to ask him if this\
  \ is a regular occurrence, and if there are any other places he has \u201Cfound\
  \ himself\u201D, other types of farm, other sewage-related locations, or indeed\
  \ anywhere else on God's earth.\nThe Year of Our Lord MCMLIII has certainly begun\
  \ with some fascinating lines of inquiry. Who knows what more lies in store?\nDecontaminated\
  \ plovers\u2019 eggs for breakfast.\n[2013-01-02]"
