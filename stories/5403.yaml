text: "Waspish playwright Maud Wasp had a glint in her eye, so she made an appointment\
  \ with a top glintist to have it analysed.\n\u201CGaze at my panel and I'll take\
  \ a look at your glint,\u201D said the glintist.\nThe panel was a rectangle of hardboard\
  \ affixed to the wall with many many tacks. Upon it had been drawn, with a thick\
  \ black marker pen, an abstruse pattern of dots and zigzags and sigils and letters\
  \ from a possibly mystic alphabet. Maud Wasp gazed at it, as bidden.\nAs a playwright,\
  \ she was alert to the sonic characteristics of the human voice, and she had noted\
  \ that the glintist spoke in a croaking and guttural manner, scarcely louder than\
  \ a whisper.\n\u201CAssuming I may speak while I gaze without interfering with your\
  \ analysis, may I ask if there is something amiss with your windpipe?\u201D she\
  \ asked.\nThe glintist, who was peering at Maud Wasp's right eye through his patent\
  \ glintoscope, replied \u201CYou are not the first person to ask me that. I do indeed\
  \ have an anomalous windpipe, with the result that my voice sounds as if it is issuing\
  \ from long ago and far away.\u201D\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Maud Wasp, \u201CIt is\
  \ almost as if I am being addressed by some chthonic being from the primordial sludge.\u201D\
  \nThe glintist snapped his glintoscope shut and slid it back into its velveteen\
  \ pochette, which in turn he popped into a pocket of his bomber jacket.\n\u201C\
  I have examined the glint in your eye with sufficient rigour to write my report,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CYou may cease gazing at the panel.\u201D\n\u201CThat was quick,\u201D\
  \ said Maud Wasp, who had been expecting a lengthier procedure.\n\u201COne of the\
  \ reasons I am a top glintist, Miss Wasp, is the startling rapidity with which I\
  \ work,\u201D he said. There was the merest hint, in his croaking, that he felt\
  \ impugned, a hint picked up by the alert playwright.\n\u201CI did not mean to impugn\
  \ you,\u201D she said, \u201CIn fact I am delighted that I can avert my gaze so\
  \ soon from that confounded panel of yours. The pattern was beginning to play havoc\
  \ with my brainpans.\u201D\n\u201CIt is rather disturbing,\u201D said the glintist,\
  \ \u201CI copied it from a plate in a book almost as ancient as my voice, a tome\
  \ kept under lock and key in a forbidden library, reputed to be the work of the\
  \ mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.\u201D\n\u201CI thought I had seen it somewhere before,\u201D\
  \ said Maud Wasp, \u201CI consulted that very book when writing the fourth of my\
  \ so-called \u2018pond plays\u2019. You may remember the deus ex machina at the\
  \ end, where a milk of magnesia man is lowered onto the stage by a pulley.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI'm afraid I have never seen any of your plays,\u201D said the glintist,\
  \ \u201CMy work keeps me fantastically busy, and on the rare occasions I might be\
  \ free to make a trip to the theatre, I often have to go to a kiosk on a seaside\
  \ pier where a charlatan healer makes enigmatic passing movements of his hands over\
  \ my anomalous windpipe.\u201D\n\u201CHave to?\u201D asked the playwright, somewhat\
  \ waspishly.\n\u201CIndeed so,\u201D said the glintist, and to Maud Wasp's surprise\
  \ she saw tears welling up in his eyes. \u201CI cannot very well neglect to meet\
  \ the demands of my sainted mother's last will and testament.\u201D\n\u201CWhat\
  \ a foul legacy!\u201D cried Maud Wasp, \u201CI am not so sure your mother was a\
  \ saint!\u201D\n\u201CIt is due to her I am a top glintist, Miss Wasp,\u201D said\
  \ the glintist, \u201CIf you only knew the sacrifices she made for me, scrubbing\
  \ doorsteps and darning military flags and boiling soap and engaging in hand-to-hand\
  \ combat with Communists and sewing buttons onto orphans\u2019 cardigans\u2026\u201D\
  \nHis croaking whisper trailed off as salt tears gushed and rolled down his cheeks.\n\
  \u201CThere, there,\u201D said the playwright, \u201CI did not mean to upset you.\
  \ Though I cannot help but observe, if you continue to weep such copious tears,\
  \ you could collect them in that dent in your floor to form a sort of indoor pond.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhy in the name of heaven would I wish to do that?\u201D croaked the glintist.\n\
  \u201CI am fond of ponds,\u201D said Maud Wasp, \u201CAnd many of my plays, more\
  \ than you can imagine, are set in or next to ponds.\u201D She grinned then, a weird\
  \ and waspish grin which disconcerted the glintist. \u201CI am so glad that I had\
  \ the foresight to tuck into a pocket of my bomber jacket a handy pocket-sized tape\
  \ recorder to preserve our conversation on magnetic tape. When I get home I shall\
  \ transcribe it and use it as the climactic scene in the play I am currently writing.\u201D\
  \n\u201CHas our conversation been sufficiently dramatic?\u201D asked the glintist.\n\
  \u201CTrust me,\u201D said Maud Wasp, \u201CI have an innate sense of the kind of\
  \ dialogue my audiences will lap up and gasp at.\u201D\nAs she spoke, the glint\
  \ in her eye glinted the more brilliantly.\n\u201CNow we know why you have a glint\
  \ in your eye,\u201D said the glintist, demonstrating the expertise that made him\
  \ no mere glintist but a top glintist.\n[2010-10-14]"
