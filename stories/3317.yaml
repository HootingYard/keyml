text: "Proof at last that Hooting Yard's eco-credentials are second to none! It is\
  \ two and a half years since we raised the important issue of carbon hoofprints,\
  \ with reference, I recall, to a vagrant goat god. Well, we were scorned and ridiculed,\
  \ but now, eventually, as I suspected would happen, the world has caught up with\
  \ our visionary eco-consciousness.\nMr Eugenides provides the valuable service of\
  \ directing our attention to a recent study:\nThe eco-pawprint of a pet dog is twice\
  \ that of a 4.6-litre Land Cruiser driven 10,000 kilometres a year, researchers\
  \ have found.\n(Incidentally, I think it was our Antipodean correspondent Glyn Webster\
  \ who created a superb compendium of wisdom by tapping \u201Cresearchers have found\u201D\
  \ into Google. Perhaps he can post it in the Comments.)\nOf course, our tireless\
  \ endeavours to be the most eco-superduper website in the universe continue apace.\
  \ Even as I write, earnest beardy besandalled Cassandras are hard at work in the\
  \ Hooting Yard Eco-Pod tallying up stats on the carbon talonprints of a crow, the\
  \ flipperprints of sea lions, and\u2014thrillingly\u2014the eco-suckerprints of\
  \ various squelchy aquatic life-forms.\nWatch this space.\n[2009-10-23]"
