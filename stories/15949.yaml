text: "\nYesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was briefly interrupted by\
  \ the dulcet tones of Miss Blossom Partridge with Miss Blossom Partridge's Knitting\
  \ Half-Hour, before Mr Key managed to regain control of the studio. Thereafter,\
  \ listeners\u2014deprived of tips such as keeping your knitting needles stuck in\
  \ a jar of rice*\u2014were treated to gobbets of prose about a Beatle, Cuxhaven,\
  \ another House of Turps, and part of a lecture by Little Bo Peep.\n* NOTA BENE\_\
  : Miss Blossom Partridge has asked me to confirm that this is a wholly genuine knitting\
  \ tip. I have seen the evidence with my own (admittedly myopic) eyes.\n[2017-11-24]"
