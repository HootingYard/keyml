text: 'You lot are already aware, I think, that Mr Key is a jolly, fun-crazed fellow,
  ever prepared to sprinkle a little happiness into your godawful lives. Indeed, I
  am often mistaken for Santa Claus, or at least a rakishly thin version of him dressed
  in drab rather than red, without a bulging sack of gift-wrapped treats for well-behaved
  tinies, and unaccompanied by reindeer. But those caveats aside, it can be hard to
  tell the difference, so lavishly do I spread joy and hysteria where''er I trudge.

  So it should come as no surprise that already, in mid-February, I have solved all
  your Christmas present purchasing worries for 2014. For on 6 November this year,
  the splendid publishing house of Constable will unleash upon a panting world Mr
  Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives. You can already go and pre-order your
  copy.


  Now I had better finish writing the damned thing.
