text: "The great Carl Sagan, in The Demon-Haunted World\_: \u201COccasionally, a vegetable\
  \ or a pattern of wood grain or the hide of a cow resembles a human face. There\
  \ was a celebrated eggplant that closely resembled Richard M Nixon. What shall we\
  \ deduce from this fact?\u201D I won't continue with the quotation, but it may be\
  \ worth posing the question: What can we deduce from the fact that I am obsessed\
  \ with Nixon\u2014to an extent I had never quite realised? Soon, inevitably, I shall\
  \ have to drum up a recipe for eggplant and mashed potato.\n[2007-02-13]"
