text: "Q\u2014When stricken with the palsy, can one maintain a flamboyant demeanour?\n\
  A\u2014As the recently elected Potus might say, yes one can. Not only can one maintain\
  \ flamboyance, but also poise. It is important to bear in mind that both these qualities,\
  \ and indeed many others, such as spark and dash and \xC3\xA9lan, are innate, and\
  \ need not be corrupted by any paresis of the limb or limbs. If, as often happens,\
  \ the paresis is accompanied by violent and uncontrollable trembling, it can prove\
  \ a tad more difficult to maintain one's flamboyance, but it is by no means an impossibility.\n\
  Take, for example, the case of that magnifico we know as Quintus Pabstus Compostus.\
  \ The ancient world had its fair share of flamboyance and poise and spark and dash\
  \ and \xC3\xA9lan, but seldom were all these attributes present in one man. From\
  \ rooftops to arcades to fora, the name of Pabstus was bruited about as a paragon.\
  \ He may indeed have lacked virtue, and horse sense, and he certainly never cut\
  \ his martial chops, but his name was, as it still remains, a byword for flamboyance.\
  \ A vivid portrait of him is drawn in the second of Puny's Six Pantopragmaticons,\
  \ viz:\n[Depending on the type of computer system you are using, text in a variety\
  \ of ancient languages may not be visible to the naked eye, nor indeed to the eye\
  \ enhanced by visual perspicuity aids.]\nAt the peak of his public esteem, Pabstus\
  \ was struck with the palsy. He was, we are told, in an arcade, on a hot morning,\
  \ cutting a dash, the cynosure of the civity, when, as if struck by a bolt of lightning,\
  \ he crumpled to the paving. Borne on a stretcher to a place of pallets, he was\
  \ laid upon one and moved into cool and shade. Vestal nymphs soothed his brow, and\
  \ a beardy haruspex was summoned to prognosticate upon his case by careful reading\
  \ of the entrails of a freshly slaughtered hen. The palsy was confirmed.\nA less\
  \ flamboyant paragon might have withered away. Consider Crotus Loppo, at one time\
  \ the rival of Pabstus, who, when felled by a debilitating ague, was swiftly revealed\
  \ to be a boor and a poltroon. All semblance of flamboyance deserted him, and he\
  \ did indeed wither away. At the very end, his bones were tossed into the Vastulus,\
  \ and the medals on which his head appeared were melted down for horseshoes.\nNot\
  \ so with Quintus Pabstus Compostus. Transferred from the pallet on to a litter,\
  \ he had himself paraded through the city, his weakened tremulous limbs covered\
  \ by a cloak that might have been thought gaudy were it not so flamboyant. He had\
  \ his beard and bouffant preened and scented with unguents and, because his speech\
  \ was not impaired, was able to dazzle the populace with his rhetoric and repartee.\
  \ This seldom made any sense, but his voice was sonorous and his delivery had great\
  \ poise. Thus he is the epitome of the palsied flamboyant.\nLess distant in time,\
  \ we might look to the Victorian dandy Auberon Wildbadger. Forever enwrapped in\
  \ a cloak as flamboyant as the one that once covered the palsied limbs of Pabstus,\
  \ Wildbadger is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a fop. But fops rarely sprout\
  \ moustachios as decisive as his, nor show such effortless poise when leaning against\
  \ large important buildings. It is no doubt pertinent that he was the son of a brimstone-and-sulphur\
  \ preacher, a reverend gentleman who shook the walls of tin tabernacles with his\
  \ frankly insane ravings. Wildbadger learned much from his father, but not what\
  \ the latter would have wished to teach his son. The young Auberon smirked at the\
  \ content, but lapped up the style. So later, when he made his way in the world,\
  \ he knew precisely how to make people gasp, and even swoon, merely by the flamboyance\
  \ with which, for example, he adjusted his cravat.\nWildbadger too was struck by\
  \ the palsy, while dining on oysters and lobster at the Caf\xC3\xA9 Showoff. Slumping\
  \ in his chair, his limbs limp, and the trembling, the trembling of his limbs not\
  \ yet set in, as it would shortly, and continue, relentlessly, for decades, the\
  \ dandy merely raised an eyebrow and called the maitre d\u2019 to his table to demand,\
  \ in his fluting voice, more oysters and an extra lobster. They were brought, but\
  \ without the flamboyance he desired, so he sent the hapless waiter away to try\
  \ again. Back came the oysters and lobster, carried on a gilt platter, but again\
  \ without the kind of dash and poise that Wildbadger, even in his physical collapse,\
  \ thought apt. Other diners could not but be struck by his \xC3\xA9lan as he commanded\
  \ the waiter back and forth until he was satisfied. As the diarist Lady Chlorine\
  \ Skippington-Pip, who was present in the Cafe, wrote:\nRare it is to witness such\
  \ flamboyance in one so palsied. Methinks we must go back as far as the ancient\
  \ world, and the example of Quintus Pabstus Compostus, to be swoony with awe at\
  \ such poise and spark and dash.\nIn summary, then, my questioner need have no fear.\
  \ I have told of two exemplars, a pair of paragons. Even in your present adversity,\
  \ you may yet prove to be a third.\n[2009-03-27]"
