text: "According to the Gazetteer Of The Bailiwicks Of Pointy Town, Big Damp Castle\
  \ is \u201Ca singularly fine example of an enormous foetid fortification covered\
  \ in mould\u201D. As its name would suggest, the castle is both big and damp. It\
  \ has always been damp, ever since it was built hundreds of years ago slap bang\
  \ next to the marshes. The baron who built it was convinced that, were he to be\
  \ attacked, it was from the marshes that his foe would emerge. He was assured of\
  \ this by his prognosticating woo-hoo wizardy man, who had seen the marshy foe in\
  \ his dreams and in his dark glass and in his pictogram cards and in the entrails\
  \ of his slaughtered poultry. Like most barons in those far-off times, the builder\
  \ of Big Damp Castle had implicit faith in the woo-hoo spouted by the man in the\
  \ pointy hat, who was always at his side.\nFumes and vapours and gases rose from\
  \ the marshes and seeped into the very fabric of the castle, and it was covered\
  \ in mould by the time the baron held a grand opening party to which he invited\
  \ all the local peasantry. Many of them died of agues and maladies contracted in\
  \ the foul damp atmosphere of the castle. The baron and his woo-hoo wizard seemed\
  \ immune, and suffered no ill effects, though they spent much of their time creeping\
  \ around the crenellations, on the lookout for the foe who would emerge from the\
  \ marshes.\nHow different it is today. The marshes have been drained, and the land\
  \ is now home to the Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol Memorial Running Track And Pole-Vaulting\
  \ Pit & Pavilion. Every weekend, picnickers gather here in the rain to commune with\
  \ the ghosts of the fictional athlete and his all-too-real coach and mentor, Old\
  \ Halob. And above their picnics loom the filthy mould-covered towering walls of\
  \ Big Damp Castle, big and damp and singularly fine.\nThe picnickers would run screaming\
  \ for their lives, if they but knew that the marshy foe seen by the woo-hoo wizardy\
  \ man all those centuries ago was still there, just out of sight, biding its time,\
  \ awaiting the necessary conjunction of stars and vapours and drizzle to come howling\
  \ and slashing into the picnic dimension. Whoever wrote the Gazetteer remains silent\
  \ on that score. I wonder why.\n[2009-08-07]"
