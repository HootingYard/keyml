text: "How impossible it is for me to make regular entries in the diary. I suddenly\
  \ remember how I used to puzzle over the word at school. Always wondering why diary\
  \ was so like Dairy and what the connection was. Never found out. Like that label\
  \ on the bottle of Daddies sauce\u2014it never stopped. The man on the label was\
  \ holding a bottle of Daddies sauce and on the label was a man holding a bottle\
  \ of Daddies sauce . . . ad infinitum ad nauseam for me at any rate.\n\nThus Kenneth\
  \ Williams in his diary for this day in 1953. Astute readers will recall that Franz\
  \ Kafka was also subject to diary-dairy befuddlement\u2014or at least the manufacturers\
  \ of postcards in his memory were so befuddled. It is unclear why this is connected\
  \ to the infinite regression of the Daddies Sauce bottle label chap, unless Williams\
  \ is trying to tell us that he has spent his entire life to date continuing to fret\
  \ about the connection between diaries and dairies. But then he was a very fretful\
  \ man, as was Kafka.\n\n[2013-01-06]"
