text: "I have just discovered this rave review of Hooting Yard by Madeleine Swann\u2014\
  what an excellent surname!\u2014who is a British \u201Cbizarro, horror, surreal,\
  \ and weird fiction writer\u201D. I do not know if she writes about swans, but I\
  \ hope she does. Anyway, she has nothing but kind words to say about Mr Key and\
  \ his prose, and she includes some links to stories featured on the Drabblecast.\
  \ They include Norm Sherman;s matchless reading of \u201CFar, Far Away\u201D, which\
  \ Ms Swann describes as \u201C[not] so much science fiction as a bowl of madness\u201D\
  . If you have not heard Norm intone the words \u201Cmagnetic mute blind love monkeys\u201D\
  , then do so right now. You will not regret it. And many thanks to Ms Swann.\n[2016-08-02]"
