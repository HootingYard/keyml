text: "It has become common in recent years for the annual Hooting Yard paperback\
  \ to be published in late autumn. This year, however, Mr Key has decided to tap\
  \ the summer reading market. Now you can sprawl on the beach at a dilapidated and\
  \ unseemly seaside resort clutching this fantastic new anthology to your heaving\
  \ bosom!\n\nPorpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke contains 250 pages of majestic sweeping\
  \ paragraphs, together with discussion notes for your Book Group and a photograph\
  \ of the Parp-O-Phone! It even has wider margins than earlier books, so you won't\
  \ need to crack the spine to sup your fill of what one critic (Snigsby) called \u201C\
  Mr Key's delicious prose nectar\u201D.\nAs ever, these timeless words are ignored\
  \ by the accountants and airheads of the literary establishment, so the only way\
  \ to get your copy is to hie over to Lulu. Do so right away!\n[2011-07-25]"
