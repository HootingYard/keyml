  \ one country would understand the remarks of that of another. The effect of the\
  \ soil of a nation, had it consequences upon its flora? Were plants influenced at\
  \ their roots? People sometimes spoke (and especially ladies) of the language of\
  \ flowers . . . the pollen therefore of an English rose would probably vary, not\
  \ inconsiderably, from that of a French, and a bee born and bred at home . . .would\
  \ be at a loss to understand (it clearly followed) the conversation of one born\
  \ and bred, here, abroad. A bee's idiom varied then, as did man's! And he wondered,\
  \ this being proved the case, where the best bees\u2019 accents were generally acquired.\n\
