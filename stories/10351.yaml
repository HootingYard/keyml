text: "Glory glory hallelujah! Glory glory hallelujah!\nThis is the appropriate verbal\
  \ response when you see saints go marching in. It is not, admittedly, something\
  \ you see very often, but it is best to be prepared, just in case, and to have the\
  \ double \u201Cglory\u201D and the \u201Challelujah\u201D ready on your lips. You\
  \ can even practise, in the absence of marching saints, to be on the safe side.\n\
  \u201CDoes it matter,\u201D I have been asked, \u201Cinto what the saints are marching?\u201D\
  \ Actually it is surprising how often I am asked this question. Only the other day\
  \ I was buttonholed in the boulevard by not one, not two, but by three separate\
  \ persons\u2014a boy scout, a widow-woman, and an art wanker\u2014each asking me,\
  \ in varying tones of urgency and desperation, if they ought to concern themselves\
  \ with the eventual destination of marching saints. In each case my answer was the\
  \ same. \u201CNo,\u201D I said, plainly and simply, hoping that would put an end\
  \ to the matter and I could continue on my way, sashaying along towards the pie\
  \ shop, or the pastry kiosk, or wherever it was I was going.\nBut neither the boy\
  \ scout, the widow-woman, nor the art wanker was satisfied by my reply and they\
  \ each had a supplementary question. These I felt duty bound to deal with. When\
  \ one is the sort of person whose advice is sought in the matter of marching saints,\
  \ one cannot merely shrug and dismiss those by whom one is importuned. To do so\
  \ would be snippy, and I am not a snippy man.\nNow, I am not going to relate to\
  \ you precisely what those three supplementary questions were. We haven't got time\
  \ to get bogged down in minutiae, have we? What I will do is try to make some general\
  \ points about marching saints, or more precisely the destinations into which we\
  \ might find them marching. You will then be able to judge if your own questions\
  \ on the matter have been answered. If not, you can either put your question in\
  \ writing and send it to me c/o the Marching Saints Investigation Bureau, or you\
  \ can smack yourself hard in the centre of your forehead and go about some other\
  \ business, such as garden maintenance or changing the fuse in one of your electrical\
  \ plugs.\nThere are innumerable situations into which saints might march. For instance,\
  \ I have seen saints go marching in to mysterious remote storage facilities out\
  \ in arid wastelands. I have seen them go marching in to certain death in the face\
  \ of enemy machine gun fire. And I have seen them go marching in to the pie shop.\
  \ In the latter case, I think they were intent not on buying pies but on making\
  \ a complaint about pies bought the previous day, which turned out to be contaminated\
  \ pies and gave them all a proper bellyache.\nThe thing is that saints tend to go\
  \ marching about, in groups, rather than keeping themselves to themselves in isolated\
  \ hermitages, convents, monasteries, and the like. Nobody is quite sure why that\
  \ is. Obviously there is the issue of strength in numbers, but any saint worth their\
  \ salt is brimful of inner strength. It is one of their saintly features. No matter\
  \ what brickbats are thrown, nor perils confronted, a saint will cope with them\
  \ due to their strength and sanctity. This much is true even of weedy or puny saints,\
  \ of whom there are more than you might expect.\nStill, for whatever reason, they\
  \ like to gather together into a pack, like wolves, and go marching, usually with\
  \ banners and drums and pipes to toot. I suppose it beats sitting around in a hermitage\
  \ gazing at the bracken and gorse growing in the doorway. Once they are marching,\
  \ they like to have somewhere to march to, something to march into. Otherwise they\
  \ would just march and march and march, until they dropped from exhaustion or until\
  \ they reached the limit of the land, and arrived at cliffs or a beach, and saw\
  \ the sea. In a sense, then, it doesn't matter into what they march. What is important\
  \ is that, as they pass, those who see them doff their hats and lift their voices\
  \ to heaven and cry \u201CGlory glory hallelujah!\u201D\nThe double \u201Cglory\u201D\
  \ is significant. Where only a single \u201Cglory\u201D is cried, I have seen marching\
  \ saints totter and stagger and in some cases fall flat on their faces. If the fallen\
  \ saint is near the front of the pack, those behind can trip over them, and come\
  \ clattering down themselves, dropping their drum or tooting pipe, causing a bigger\
  \ obstacle to those further behind, and resulting in a chaotic heap of limb-flailing\
  \ saints. Though this can be amusing to watch, it would be sinful to laugh, as I\
  \ am sure you know. I once chuckled when I saw a collapsed pack of marching saints,\
  \ and not long afterwards I was visited in the night by a horrible black swooping\
  \ bat of penitence. I did not forget that in a hurry.\nAs with the double \u201C\
  glory\u201D so with the \u201Challelujah\u201D. You might want to practise your\
  \ pronunciation of this cry. That \u2018j\u2019 can be treacherous. Remember that\
  \ it is only Rastafarians who give it the common \u2018j\u2019 sound, as when they\
  \ are babbling on about Jah and the sufferation in Babylon. As a consequence, \u201C\
  hallelujah\u201D is sometimes spelled \u201Challeluiah\u201D, for the benefit of\
  \ dimwits. As you can imagine, missing out \u201Challelujah\u201D after \u201Cglory\
  \ glory\u201D can be even more calamitous than a single \u201Cglory\u201D. As I\
  \ explained, with inhuman patience, to the boy scout and the widow-woman and the\
  \ art wanker, a night-time visit from a horrible black swooping bat of penitence\
  \ would be the very least of your worries if you omitted the \u201Challelujah\u201D\
  . Take my word for it, you don't want to know the awful details.\nIn our next article\
  \ on marching saints, we will look in some detail at chronology. When exactly is\
  \ the \u201Cwhen\u201D when the saints go marching in? Before then, your homework\
  \ is to list three such occasions, backed up by documentary evidence. To avoid confusion,\
  \ give your times using the twenty-four hour clock.\n[2012-10-14]"
