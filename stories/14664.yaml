text: "There was a happy conjunction of words in the Guardian crossword the other\
  \ day. When solved, the leftmost column on the grid read ANDORRAN VANDAL. Remarkably,\
  \ these were precisely the words which appeared, in the form of punched-out holes,\
  \ on the small piece of dun cardboard spat out by the Hooting Yard Analogue Topic\
  \ Generating Machine, a piece of gubbins I had knocked up for me by a boffin.\n\
  Most writers will tell you that the question they are most often asked is \u201C\
  where do you get your ideas from?\u201DMost writers will also tell you that it is\
  \ a brain-numbingly stupid question to which there is no pat answer. But I have\
  \ no difficulty answering it. For many years now, I have not had to summon a single\
  \ idea in my head. Instead, what happens is that a variety of arcane and abstruse\
  \ data is fed into the Hooting Yard Analogue Topic Generating Machine and, after\
  \ humming and buzzing for a while, it spits out a small piece of dun cardboard on\
  \ which is punched out a word or, more often, a few words, thus providing me with\
  \ my topic and freeing me from the tedium of having to think of anything myself.\n\
  So remarkable was the coincidence of my given topic being replicated, exactly, in\
  \ the Guardian crossword, that I fell out of my chair. How often does that actually\
  \ happen in real life? But I did, I toppled from my chair and lay sprawled on the\
  \ carpet, dribbling. After some minutes, I realised that this was a far more comfortable\
  \ position than sitting in the chair, so I stayed put. The only drawback was that\
  \ my pencil and paper were up on the desk, and I could not reach them. Still, it\
  \ was very restful on the floor, so I dozed off. That is why nothing appeared here,\
  \ on that day, about the ANDORRAN VANDAL, nor indeed has anything appeared here\
  \ for several days in a row. I have become regrettably enamoured of lying on the\
  \ floor, dribbling and dozing.\nHad I the pep to tell you about the ANDORRAN VANDAL,\
  \ you would learn that this was a sobriquet once given to Babinsky 2, the idiot\
  \ half-brother of the lumbering walrus-moustached serial killer Babinsky. Babinsky\
  \ 2 earned the name during a period in which he went rampaging around Andorra smashing\
  \ up telephone kiosks and daubing ruderies upon road signs. He dressed in full Andorran\
  \ national costume while so engaged, and was thus mistaken for a native of that\
  \ mountainous land.\nFurther details can be found in a footnote on page 841 of A\
  \ Thick, Chunky History of Vandalism in Andorra, From 1554 Up To Last Thursday (Spurious\
  \ Tomes, 2016).\n[2016-03-21]"
