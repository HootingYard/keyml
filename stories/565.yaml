text: "For a long time, for years and years and years, I have been meaning to write\
  \ about Dobson's dinghy. It is a subject which I am convinced will be hypnotically\
  \ fascinating to my readers, and yet whenever I settle to the task, as I did yesterday\
  \ morning, with the nib of my pen polished to a gleam and a fresh stack of blank\
  \ rectangular paper, I found myself once again baffled and plaintive. It is not\
  \ that the contents of my skull seized up, like a polar ship in pack ice, for I\
  \ had done my usual crack-of-dawn brain exercises, flexing the synapses using a\
  \ set of techniques culled from a Victorian Everyday book. Some might say that synapses\
  \ are not things you can flex, and they may be correct, but I am sure you understand\
  \ what I am driving at. The point is that I was in tiptop writing condition, hunched\
  \ over my desk, nib gleaming and paper stacked and blank, and outside my window\
  \ crows were stalking across the grass, fat and black and Ted Hughesy, and the sight\
  \ of crows seldom fails to inspire me, no matter what I am writing about. Sometimes\
  \ I have filled pages and pages blathering on about crows, and then cleverly crossed\
  \ out every mention of the bird and substituted it with another noun, for example\
  \ windscreen wiper or bazooka, or even with a dozen different nouns, whimsically,\
  \ in a great creative outpouring the like of which would put Dobson himself to shame,\
  \ were he still with us. I have tried this technique over the years when trying\
  \ to write about Dobson's dinghy, as a weapon against my bafflement, but it never\
  \ quite works, and those pages are turned into scrap or made into paper aeroplanes\
  \ or paper hovercraft or paper Hindenburg airships, depending on my mood of the\
  \ moment. It can be very relaxing to fold one's abandoned manuscripts into toy forms\
  \ of transport. Once, I was so thoroughly relaxed after folding half a hopeless\
  \ novella into a paper fleet of milk floats that I fell into a coma. Other writers\
  \ find different uses for their discarded scribblings. The poet Dennis Beerpint,\
  \ I learned, tears his disjecta into thousands of pieces, with untold savagery,\
  \ cursing and fuming as he does so, while Pebblehead, the bestselling paperbackist,\
  \ binds all his up into a bundle with butchers\u2019 string and carries it down\
  \ to the beach and throws it into the sea. Frankly, I am surprised that a writer\
  \ as successful and prolific as \_Pebblehead ever has aborted works to so dispose\
  \ of, but I am told that he is seen upon the sands at least once a week, casting\
  \ his bundles upon the briny. Dobson never launched his dinghy into the sea. On\
  \ very rare occasions, when the fancy took him, he would push it into a pond and\
  \ clamber in and paddle it across, alarming any ducks, such as teal and coots, who\
  \ got in his way. The dinghy was yellow, and made of rubber, and Dobson bought it\
  \ at a closing-down sale from a ruined ship chandler's. There. There is the essence\
  \ of my bafflement and my plaintiveness. I have just told you everything I know\
  \ about Dobson's dinghy. Every time I have a mind to write about it, I reach the\
  \ same impasse. I have exhausted the topic, and have nothing else to say. Give me\
  \ a week, or a month, and no doubt I will wake up one morning and feel impelled,\
  \ yet again, to try to write dozens of pages of vigorous and impassioned prose about\
  \ Dobson's dinghy. I will mention the pond, the yellow colour, the rubber fabric,\
  \ and the ruined ship's chandler, and that will be that.\n[2008-09-18]"
