text: "The Farmer Rebukes His Spade is the title of a painting by Cedric Farmpainter,\
  \ RA. It has been described as his first great daub and as the jewel of the Pointy\
  \ Town Municipal Galeria. The work itself was destroyed in an inexplicable bird-related\
  \ cataclysm, and today exists only in the form of a mezzotint copy by the noted\
  \ mezzotintist Rex Tint. Tint always claimed that he made his print by sitting in\
  \ front of the original painting, gazing at it for hours, working steadily, but\
  \ his account has been called into question by his own sister, Dot Tint. In her\
  \ memoir of her brother, she wrote that he cannot have sat where he said he sat,\
  \ having been barred from entering the Galeria or its grounds or appurtenances by\
  \ dint of \u201Cinsufferable pomposity\u201D.\nAt this distance in time, we can\
  \ never know which Tint, Rex or Dot, is telling the truth. All we have is the mezzotint\
  \ itself, several thousand copies of which were printed and distributed by Rex Tint's\
  \ devoted and possibly insane patron, Walter Mad.\nThe Farmer Rebukes His Spade\
  \ is a rustic scene. It shows a dreary and rainsoaked field, pitted with many a\
  \ puddle. To the left, there is a tree, which may be a larch or box or plane or\
  \ sycamore, against the trunk of which is leaning a spade, at an angle of forty-two\
  \ degrees (it has been measured, precisely, by swivel-eyed enthusiasts). Next to\
  \ the tree and the spade, in side profile, is the figure of a farmer, florid of\
  \ face and fat of belly. One arm is raised, and one finger of one puffy hand is\
  \ in mid-wag. The farmer appears to be shouting his head off in what one critic\
  \ has described as \u201Can unbridled and unhinged spewing forth of rancour and\
  \ remonstrance\u201D. In the top left corner, silhouetted against the bleak sky,\
  \ there is a bird, almost certainly a small bittern which, as other sources confirm,\
  \ was the favourite bird of both Rex Tint and Cedric Farmpainter. (See \u201CPainters\
  \ and mezzotintists wax elegiac about their favourite birds\u201D, The Journal Of\
  \ Mezzotint- And Painting-Related Ornithology, Vol XXVII, No. 8, August 1909.)\n\
  My own copy of the mezzotint was unfortunately destroyed in the course of a sophisticated\
  \ cocktail party which got out of hand and swiftly descended into an unsophisticated\
  \ cocktail party and pitched battle.\n[2014-09-17]"
