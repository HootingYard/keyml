text: "I think it highly likely that quite a few Hooting Yard readers will have woken\
  \ up this morning thinking to themselves, \u201CGosh! It really is time I bought\
  \ myself a map of Switzerland! As soon as I have done my ablutions and chomped my\
  \ breakfast I shall head off to the cartographers\u2019 bazaar to make a judicious\
  \ purchase!\u201D\nIt is thus fortunate that I can pass on to you some very sensible\
  \ advice in the matter, courtesy of that excellent Mr Ruskin.\nThe Original von\
  \ Keller's Zweiter Reisekarte der Schweitz (1844) is, says Ruskin, \_\u201Cthe only\
  \ map of Switzerland which has ever been executed with common sense and intelligence\u201D\
  . (Praeterita, Volume II, Chapter XI, paragraph 215.) Lord knows there are plenty\
  \ of maps of Switzerland made with foolhardiness and stupidity, and you might have\
  \ gone and bought one of those. Notch that up as another triumph for Hooting Yard's\
  \ map-procurement advisory service.\nThe illustration below is a detail from von\
  \ Keller's earlier 1825 map of Switzerland. It has clearly been executed with somewhat\
  \ less common sense and intelligence than the 1844 version, but is still far more\
  \ sensible than the average Swiss map.\n\n[2009-08-08]"
