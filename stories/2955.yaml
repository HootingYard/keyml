text: "\u201CAmong the animals who expend industry on hygiene and the protection of\
  \ their dwellings, we must place Bees in the first line. It may happen that mice,\
  \ snakes, and moths may find their way into a hive. Assaulted by the swarm, and\
  \ riddled with stings, they die without being able to escape. These great corpses\
  \ cannot be dragged out by the Hymenoptera, and their putrefaction threatens to\
  \ cause disease. To remedy this scourge the insects immediately cover them with\
  \ propolis\u2014that is to say, the paste which they manufacture from the resin\
  \ of poplars, birches, and pines. The corpse thus sheltered from contact with the\
  \ air does not putrefy. In other respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness\
  \ of their dwellings; they remove with care and throw outside dust, mud, and sawdust\
  \ which may be found there. Bees are careful also not to defile their hives with\
  \ excrement, as Kirby noted; they go aside to expel their excretions, and in winter,\
  \ when prevented by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going out for this\
  \ purpose, their bodies become so swollen from retention of f\xE6ces that when at\
  \ last able to go out they fall to the ground and perish.\u201D\nFrom The Industries\
  \ Of Animals by Fr\xE9d\xE9ric Houssay (1893)\nIs that not inexpressibly sad?\n\
