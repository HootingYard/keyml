text: "Mrs Gubbins, the octogenarian crone given to knitting and villainy, has recently\
  \ come under the supervision of a doctor. It will not be too long before she becomes\
  \ a nonagenarian crone, and though she is in terrifyingly tiptop health for one\
  \ so aged, there have been signs that all is not well. First there was the abduction\
  \ of Little Severin, the Mystic Badger, after which she went on the run for several\
  \ months, holed up in a dank cave guarded by bats and owls. This was followed by\
  \ her becoming smitten by the unlikely figure of Mark E Smith, and her habit of\
  \ playing the complete works of The Fall at ear-splitting volume on a brand new\
  \ Bang & Olufbangbangbang hi-fi system, with her windows open, at all hours of the\
  \ day and night. A dawn visit from Blunkett and Blears, respectively sightless and\
  \ diminutive, and somehow all the more minatory for being so, set her back on the\
  \ straight and narrow.\nA couple of weeks ago, La Gubbins\u2019 knitting circle\
  \ invited Rolf Harris to give a talk. Unable to attend, yet honoured to be asked,\
  \ Harris instead sent a tape recording of an entertaining address in which he spoke\
  \ for some hours about various Rolfs and Ralphs and Rafes and Raufs. Fatefully,\
  \ at one point he mentioned the name of Rauf Denktash, the one-time President of\
  \ the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Hearing those two syllables, denk and\
  \ tash, together, Mrs Gubbins was propelled into a fugue state, from which she has\
  \ yet to emerge.\nDenktash Fugue Syndrome is a thankfully rare condition, so rare\
  \ that Mrs Gubbins is only the second person in history to display the symptoms.\
  \ It was first identified by the Victorian mountaineer and eccentric Dr Henry Hyde\
  \ Hargreaves Hopton Hibbingdibhoondoon during a sojourn in Tashkent. The journals\
  \ in which he wrote of his discovery have long been lost, or disfigured by potato\
  \ mould, depending on who you believe, but the basic facts were retailed by Dobson\
  \ in one of his early pamphlets. Atop a Tashkent mountain one day in 1862, the doctor's\
  \ brain was ravaged by mysterious fumes, and, when he tried to say \u201CTashkent\u201D\
  \ it came out as \u201CDenktash\u201D. With him upon the peak was a dumpy, bearded\
  \ sage, a man not unlike the Beatles\u2019 pal the Maharishi in appearance, who,\
  \ when he heard the word \u201CDenktash\u201D, was sent into a fugue state. In his\
  \ journal, Hibbingdibhoondoon spelled it \u201Cfoog\u201D, but it is clear what\
  \ he meant.\nWhat remains unclear is for how long the sage remained so affected.\
  \ Dobson's account simply peters out, in that annoying way he had, and which can\
  \ make his early works such a trial to read. Also unclear is the nature of the fugue\
  \ itself. In Mrs Gubbins\u2019 case, it appears to take the form of dribbling, staring\
  \ vacantly into the fireplace, and absentmindedly unravelling not only the tea cosy\
  \ she has herself been in the midst of knitting but also those of her compa\xF1\
  eros in the knitting circle.\nDoctor Drainditch, who has been called in to treat\
  \ the loveable yet spiky crone, claims to be the only living expert on Denktash\
  \ Fugue Syndrome. Unfortunately, the treatment she recommends consists of a two-week\
  \ retreat in a dank cave guarded by bats and owls with an abducted badger for company,\
  \ followed by a therapeutic course of listening to the complete works of The Fall\
  \ at ear-splitting volume. So round and round we go, it seems.\nIf you, or anybody\
  \ close to you, is suffering from Denktash Fugue Syndrome, there is a helpline number\
  \ available. Premium rates apply, and if you manage to get through you might be\
  \ lucky enough to hear a pre-recorded message from Rolf Harris telling you not to\
  \ worry yourself sick. All callers are entered in a raffle, with the chance to win\
  \ one of Mrs Gubbins\u2019 tea cosy knitting patterns. You must tell your parents\
  \ before placing the call, and if your parents have passed to the ethereal realm\
  \ beyond our puny understanding, there is a range of ouija boards and ectoplasmic\
  \ goo on special offer at Hubermann's department store.\n[2008-07-27]"
