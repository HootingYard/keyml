text: "Several years ago, I wrote \u201CAccounts of dreams are rarely of interest\
  \ to anyone other than the dreamer\u201D before going on to describe a dream in\
  \ which I was about to attack the late actor Roy Kinnear with a chair-leg. Since\
  \ then, I have occasionally shared with readers other dreams I have had, when I\
  \ think they may be of interest. What I have not done is to recount somebody else's\
  \ slumberland visions. I was so delighted, however, by reader Mark Patterson's dream\
  \ that I felt impelled to post it here:\nDreamt last night that my only Christmas\
  \ present was a \u2018Ginger Complains\u2019 dvd. 70 minutes of poor quality footage\
  \ featuring Ginger Baker grumbling about this and that in front of a succession\
  \ of run-down cinemas. \u200E25% of his griping was inaudible due to poor sound\
  \ quality.\n\nGinger Baker in happier times, with his mum\n[2011-12-07]"
