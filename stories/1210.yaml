  \ of error. That doesn't work, and it doesn't work for reasons that are so obvious\
  \ that failure to grasp them is simply childish. If that did work then all authors\
  \ could just say \u2018this book is inspired by God and it is truth without any\
  \ mixture of error\u2019 and be taken seriously.\u201D\u2014Ophelia Benson at Butterflies\
  \ And Wheels.\nWell, it may be childish to so aver, but Mr Key's prose is inspired\
  \ by the hideous bat-god Fatso, and it is truth without any mixture of error. Put\
  \ that in your pipe and smoke it, as they say.\n[2008-12-25]"
