text: "Lend me your ear while I call you a fool. You were kissed by a witch one night\
  \ in the wood. Well, you thought it was a witch, but actually it was the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman, broadly similar to, but not exactly, a witch. She kissed you, there in\
  \ the wood, in the night, and then she turned into a crow and flew away, you did\
  \ not see where to, for it was so dark in the wood. What were you doing there, so\
  \ late? You ought to have been tucked up in bed in your crumbling chamber on the\
  \ topmost floor of Sludge Hall. But for reasons known only to yourself, you had\
  \ set your pig-shaped alarm clock for half past two in the morning, and you woke\
  \ and dressed in gaudy raiment and stalked down the servants\u2019 staircase and\
  \ out of the pantry door and along the lane, and when you reached the edge of the\
  \ wood you pressed on, not stopping, though the trees grew denser and denser, until\
  \ you met with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. She kissed you, and turned into a crow,\
  \ but you were not transformed, you stayed just as you were, a fool, in the middle\
  \ of the wood, in the middle of the night.\nDid you expect that you too would become\
  \ a crow, or some other bird, a linnet or a partridge? And had you done so, what\
  \ then? Did you think you could beat your wings and fly, and follow what you thought\
  \ was a witch to where she perched, in the form of a crow, upon the sturdy branch\
  \ of an oak tree? Remember that many of the trees in the wood are smeared with birdlime,\
  \ and you might have become stuck, waiting helplessly for dawn to break and for\
  \ the hunting men to come and break your neck and stuff you into a sack. You need\
  \ have no fear that such a fate will befall the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, for long before\
  \ morning she will transform herself again, from a crow into a squirrel, or a gnat,\
  \ and she will have no trouble unsticking herself from the birdlime for she will\
  \ use her powers. Perhaps you thought that, with one kiss from her, you would be\
  \ granted those powers? Fool, fool! That is not how it works, and never has been,\
  \ and you would know that if you had read your storybooks carefully.\nAs it is,\
  \ you were left alone in the wood, in the dark, kissed but untransformed, if anything\
  \ more foolish than you had been before. What then, you wondered, did the kiss portend?\
  \ And why had the witch, in truth the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, turned into a crow and\
  \ flown away from you? Did she want you to seek her, to blunder about in the dark\
  \ wood trying to find her perch, to clamber up the trunk of the oak and join her\
  \ there in your foolish, still human form? Or did she intend that you turn back,\
  \ once kissed, turn back and trudge all along the lane back to Sludge Hall, to climb\
  \ back up the stairs and into your upper chamber and into your bed, and fall asleep,\
  \ and remember nothing?\nBeing a fool, you do not know which choice to make, so\
  \ you simply stand there, in the middle of the wood. Suddenly, above, shifting clouds\
  \ reveal the moon, the cold-hearted orb that rules the night. Through a gap in the\
  \ dense leafage of oaks and sycamores and pines, a shaft of silver light beams down\
  \ upon you. It lights up the mark on your forehead, the crimson mark where you were\
  \ kissed by the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. You will not see it until morning when, hearing\
  \ the boots of the hunting men crunching through the duff, you gather what poor\
  \ wits you have, and walk out of the wood, not back to Sludge Hall, but out the\
  \ other side, towards the pond. At the pond, you stoop to see your reflection in\
  \ the water. You see the head of a fool, bearing the mark of the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman. It is ineradicable. And swans paddle across the pond towards you, dozens\
  \ of swans. The mark on your forehead begins to glow. It grows hot, until it is\
  \ burning bright, and you see it reflected in the eyes of the swans. They surround\
  \ you now, white and silent, as you slump to your knees at the edge of the pond.\
  \ They will never let you leave them, You belong to them now. They worship you,\
  \ with the fanaticism only swans are capable of. You are still a fool, but of a\
  \ new, uncanny type. And as the swans gaze at you, unblinking, you hear the cawing\
  \ of a crow, somewhere in the sky above, and feel a sharp pang in your forehead,\
  \ where you were kissed by the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman at night in the wood.\n[2009-10-08]"
