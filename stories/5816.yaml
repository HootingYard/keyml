text: "\nThis week over at The Dabbler I am afraid I have had to issue a set of corrections\
  \ and clarifications to Old Key's Almanacke for 2011. As I point out, the errors\
  \ in the original were probably due to the wrong kind of ectoplasm on the line,\
  \ the \u201Cline\u201D in this case being an invisible thread strung between the\
  \ corporeal world and the eldritch realms inhabited by the shade of Old Key himself.\n\
  The mysterious prognosticator can, however, already claim a triumph of foresight\
  \ in the first week of the year. Old Key noted that birds fall out of the sky when\
  \ petulant Ozymandias, King of Kings, gets one of his temper tantrums, and what\
  \ do we find? In Arkansas, blackbirds have plummeted from the blue, while flocks\
  \ of jackdaws have crashed to earth in Sweden.\n[2011-01-07]"
