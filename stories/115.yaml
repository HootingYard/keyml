text: "This piece first appeared in August 2004. I am posting it again for the simple\
  \ reason that now, thanks to the indefatigable Salim Fadhley, it can be accompanied\
  \ by a photograph, and thus be truly inspiring\u2026\nI am suffering from a spiritual\
  \ malaise. I am soul sick. I have not eaten any breakfast. I need to darn a hole\
  \ in the sleeve of my jumper, but I have no further wool that matches. I feel inconsequential\
  \ and abandoned and remote. My cheeks blush furiously with an embarrassment born\
  \ of pity. Every last pencil I have is blunt. I am being driven crackers by my landlord's\
  \ drooling hound. My senses are atrophied, like a muscle unexercised. Pots and pans\
  \ are strewn haphazardly in my kitchen. My legs have given way. I have an evil taste\
  \ in my mouth. Hope is something for other people, not for me. My teapot is cracked\
  \ and the cosy is stained and threadbare. Nervous spasms contort my features. I\
  \ keep to the shadows if I have to move in the street. Do you hear that sound? It\
  \ is my groan of despair. I have extinguished all the lanterns and I know in my\
  \ cold, base heart that they will never be lit again. The air is heavy with menace\
  \ and all I can hear is the screaming of desolation and ruin. Insects swarm about\
  \ my face but I cannot summon the energy to swat them away. I have sprained my ankle.\
  \ Dust lies everywhere, ashes and dust. Desire, ah, desire for me is not even a\
  \ memory. Feral cats hiss at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry is contaminated.\
  \ All sense of urgency is lost and yet I cannot relax. My head is swimming. My shoes\
  \ let in rainwater and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin is cracked. The taps\
  \ no longer work. Even the most innocent and cherubic children spit at me. I gag\
  \ on my own wretchedness. And then with a mighty effort, I pull myself up, and I\
  \ trudge across Bulgaria like a whipped cur, and I go the Central Post Office building\
  \ in Plovdiv, and I look at Georgi Bozhilov's mural. Yes, that Georgi Bozhilov,\
  \ whose nickname was Slona, or Elephant, a member of the so-called Plovdiv Fivesome.\
  \ I gaze at the post office mural and somehow I am pulled back from the brink, and\
  \ I embrace life again, wholeheartedly, blissfully. Here\u2026 here is a photograph\
  \ of the mural, so you too can gaze upon it, and experience revelation!\n\n[2007-03-14]"
