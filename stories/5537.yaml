text: "I am having one of my occasional bursts of activity on Facecloth, the social\
  \ networking site. Temperamentally, a Diogenesian recluse such as myself would be\
  \ better suited to an antisocial network, but needs must when the devil drives,\
  \ as they say. Yesterday I posted on Facecloth a snippet which fits neatly into\
  \ the Hooting Yard \u201CThings I Have Learned\u201D category, and it elicited a\
  \ couple of comments in reply which are worth sharing with a wider audience.\nI\
  \ learned, from Peter Ackroyd's new book The English Ghost\_: Spectres Through Time,\
  \ (and I quote from my paraphrase at Facecloth):\nOn Christmas Day 1716, Samuel\
  \ Wesley (father of John Wesley) was haunted by an apparition of \u201Ca badger,\
  \ with no head\u201D. It was called Jeffrey.\nThis is something I am very, very\
  \ glad to know, and I doubt that a Yuletide will pass in future without me mentioning\
  \ it.\nBob Drake replied, saying \u201CThat got me thinking. Would I rather be haunted\
  \ by a badger's disembodied head, or a badger's headless body? I can only conclude\
  \ that it would depend on the temperament of the partial apparition\u201D, while\
  \ Roland Clare picked up the echo of Jubilate Agno, and suggested: \u201CFor I Will\
  \ Consider My Headless Badger Jeffrey \u2026\u201D\nIt is my fond hope that Mr Drake\
  \ will be inspired to write a song on the subject, and Mr Clare will essay a badgerised\
  \ version of the pertinent section of Christopher Smart's poem.\n[2010-11-07]"
