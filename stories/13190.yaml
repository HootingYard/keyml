text: "Having been somewhat disconsolate of late, for reasons I need not bore you\
  \ with (but hence the silence here), I needed a laugh, and was rewarded this morning.\
  \ In the Guardian, Suzanne Goldenberg interviews Naomi Klein.\nShe flies, already\
  \ a lot more than most people, and is set to rack up air miles that would make her,\
  \ by her own admission, \u201Ca climate criminal\u201D \u2026 Yet she confesses\
  \ to getting weepy when she thinks about the future under climate change.\nImagine\
  \ poor Naomi sobbing her heart out. But not to worry \u2026\nShe says she is not\
  \ going to be trapped into \u201Cgotcha games\u201D about personal habits.\nSpeaking\
  \ of the Guardian, Rod Liddle has an amusing line about the online video lectures\
  \ delivered by Russell Brand:\nlike a condensed version of a particularly bad edition\
  \ of the Guardian, filtered through the veins of an imbecile.\n[2014-09-15]"
