  \ She was a bricklaying witch and she carried a hod. She asked \u201CWhich of you\
  \ is Blynken, which Wynken, which Nod?\u201D Beaky replied on behalf of the five,\
  \ \u201CThat trio is fictional, but we are alive. They were invented for verse by\
  \ Eugene Field.\u201D With these words the fivesome's fate was sealed. The witch's\
  \ countenance became twisted with hate and she cried \u201CI'm his childhood sweetheart,\
  \ Captivity Waite! He abandoned me, the cur, the dog, yet my name is immortalised\
  \ in his autobiog, Love Affairs Of A Bibliomaniac\u201C, and then, maddened, she\
  \ started to whack Dave Dee and Dozy and Beaky and Mick and Tich with brick after\
  \ brick after brick until in the wood in the dead of the night the soul of each\
  \ pop star took heavenward flight. Their mortal lives gone, they sat next to God,\
  \ despatched by the bricklaying witch with her hod.\n[2010-10-15]"
