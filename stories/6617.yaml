text: "Recently I posted a piece about a giant who roars \u201CFee Fi Fo Fum!\u201D\
  \ and smells the blood of an Englishman, and a couple of years ago I became enthusiastic\
  \ about Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601) among whose works is the splendidly titled Have\
  \ With You To Saffron Walden\u2014which, alas, I never got round to reading. Had\
  \ I done so, I would already have learned what I found out today.\nFather had taken\
  \ us to see John Gielgud in the title role [of King Lear] at Stratford-upon-Avon,\
  \ and although Gielgud was marvellous, it was the words of Poor Tom, the Bedlam\
  \ beggar on the stormy heath (actually Edgar, in disguise), that still rang in my\
  \ ears:\nChild Rowland to the dark tower came;\nHis word was still\nFie, foh, and\
  \ fum!\nI smell the blood of a British man!\n\u201CDid Shakespeare steal that from\
  \ Jack and the Beanstalk?\u201D I had whispered in Daffy's ear. Or had the fairytale\
  \ borrowed the words from Shakespeare? \u201CNeither,\u201D she whispered back:\
  \ both had cribbed them from Thomas Nashe's Have With You To Saffron Walden, which,\
  \ having been staged in 1596, pre-dated them.\nThis is from The Weed That Strings\
  \ The Hangman's Bag by Alan Bradley (2010), the second of his Flavia de Luce mysteries.\
  \ These are new to me, but I am pleased to tell you that the heroine is an eleven-year-old\
  \ amateur chemist and sleuth\u2014a plucky and resourceful tot who bears a striking\
  \ resemblance to our very own Tiny Enid, without the fascism and the club foot.\
  \ It is a hugely enjoyable read, as one might expect from a book which makes mention\
  \ of \u201Ca pair of gutta-percha motoring galoshes (\u2018Ideal for Country Breakdowns\u2019\
  )\u201D.\n[2011-05-22]"
