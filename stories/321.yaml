text: "\nThis is a detail from a picture which appeared long ago in the Hooting Yard\
  \ Calendar 1993. I reproduce it here partly on a whim, and partly to alert readers\
  \ to the fact that in the new year I will be auctioning the artwork from one or\
  \ more Hooting Yard Calendars. Given that the successful bidders (if any) will be\
  \ buying the original pen, pencil, Tippex, and what have you drawings, I'm hoping\
  \ the sales will attract \u201Cart\u201D prices\u2026 you know, stupid amounts of\
  \ money. It could be that I'm living in a fool's paradise, but even if that's the\
  \ case, I would like to ask readers to post expressions of interest in the Comments,\
  \ so I can get an idea whether to go ahead with this harebrained scheme. An expression\
  \ of interest is just that, not a commitment, and by all means post anonymously\
  \ if you so wish. Oh, and I haven't yet decided whether to auction single drawings\
  \ or a whole calendar's artwork as a set, so you might want to suggest a preference.\n\
