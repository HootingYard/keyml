text: "And then, as we know, there came the time when Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
  \ came a-cropper. He was in pursuit of a shifty pastry hawker, a man with a barrow,\
  \ known to galumph along ill-lit lanes. Tarleton carried a torch, sweeping its bright\
  \ beam ahead of him, both to avoid pits and puddles and in hope that he might catch\
  \ a glimpse of his quarry. But, as the old saying has it, a torch in the hands of\
  \ a nincompoop sheds no light.\nIncidentally, it is well worth your while to jot\
  \ down old sayings in a notepad when you hear them. They can be invaluable in establishing\
  \ rapport with countryside peasants. If you fall into conversation with such a person,\
  \ you will discover that their utterances often consist of little else but old sayings\
  \ strung together. By dropping in your own crumbs of rustic wisdom from time to\
  \ time, you will be able to maintain conversational sparkle in otherwise trying\
  \ circumstances. The beauty of it is, you do not need to grasp the actual meaning\
  \ of the old sayings you deploy.\nConsider, for example, the one we have just encountered,\
  \ a torch in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light. On the face of it, this would\
  \ seem to make little or no sense, unless we presume the nincompoop has neglected\
  \ to press the knob that lights the bulb of the torch he is carrying. But one must\
  \ always avoid presumption, as we learned from Bl\xF6tzmann (Third Notebook, Lavender\
  \ Series). Say that saying to, say, a sophisticated urban person at a swish cocktail\
  \ party, and you face a series of brusque questions demanding that you clarify what\
  \ you are saying. Say the same words to a peasant in the countryside and as likely\
  \ as not he will suck thoughtfully on his piece of straw and nod, before parrying\
  \ with a saying of his own, such as You can't milk a goat with a hammer.\nBut wait\
  \ wait wait! [These are the words erupting inside your head, dear reader. You see,\
  \ I know you only too well.] Grateful as I am to be given tips on talking to peasants,\
  \ tips I will no doubt make use of when next I go trudging through an area of rustic\
  \ squalor, I cannot let pass the clear implication in your opening paragraph that\
  \ Tarleton was a nincompoop. How can such things be? Tarleton, the amateur's amateur.\
  \ a nincompoop? Surely, sir, you are in jest!\nLet me answer that. It is true enough\
  \ that few persons have ever trod this earth whose brains were as acute as Tarleton's.\
  \ Indeed, hold his brain in the palm of your hand and you would be astonished at\
  \ its heft. It is worth noting, in this context, that you could, if you wished to,\
  \ so hold Tarleton's brain. It is kept preserved in jelly in a jar in a display\
  \ case in the lobby of his alma mater, Miss Blossom Partridge's Institute For The\
  \ Education Of Frighteningly Adept Tinies. Make an appointment with the bursar,\
  \ don a pair of gloves, and an attendant will open the display case and unscrew\
  \ the lid from the jar and, with special tweezers, lift the brain from its protective\
  \ jelly and allow you to hold it, registering its heft, for up to sixty seconds.\
  \ The jar is clearly labelled with Tarleton's name, so you will not mistake it for\
  \ the brains of other alumni in other jellies in other jars in other display cases\
  \ in the same lobby.\nNow, as true as it is that Tarleton was no dimwit, it is equally\
  \ true that nincompoopery is to be found in the most unexpected places. Here we\
  \ might recall another aper\xE7u of Bl\xF6tzmann's, from the Fifth Notebook, Lilac\
  \ Series. No man is all nincompoop, he observed, but all men have an inner nincompoop\
  \ ever ready to emerge and flourish. Bl\xF6tzmann compares this inner nincompoop\
  \ to a mayfly, in a passage I recommend to your attention. His point is that even\
  \ the most dazzlingly sensible and spectacular minds may, from time to time, and\
  \ ephemerally, exhibit the sure signs of nincompoopery. This is what, I argue, happened\
  \ with Tarleton as he stumbled down an ill-lit lane in pursuit of the shifty pastry\
  \ hawker.\nIt was night, a black night, moonless and starless on account of a great\
  \ shroud of cloud. The first incipient sign of Tarleton's inner nincompoop was that\
  \ he did not wait until sunrise to go prowling after his quarry. Even the swiftest\
  \ of shifty pastry hawkers cannot cover too much ground, trundling a barrow, in\
  \ the hours between dusk and dawn. And though the lane would still be ill-lit, in\
  \ the daylight, shaded as it was on either side by towering pines and titanic cedars,\
  \ yet there would be light enough for a man of Tarleton's piercing vision. Not so\
  \ on this night, this black unholy night.\nUnholy, I say, because it was the one\
  \ night in the calendar year when imps and goblins are let loose from their fetters\
  \ and are free to dash about, all mischief and havoc and mayhem. On this night churns\
  \ are upended, wells poisoned, cows turned inside out. That, at least, is what the\
  \ peasants believe. It is what they will tell you, in the form of old sayings, if\
  \ you are willing to listen. The wise man stays abed on St Spivack's night, they\
  \ will say, or When Spivack's Night comes round again, burn a dolly and slaughter\
  \ a hen.\nFor all the startling heft of his brain, Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
  \ did not heed such warnings. In fact he dismissed the peasants\u2019 old sayings\
  \ as nonsensical babble. This was his undoing. This was his nincompoopery. And so\
  \ he went a-stumbling along an ill-lit lane in the night, sweeping the beam of his\
  \ torch ahead of him. What was he to do when, of a sudden, a goblin came swooping\
  \ down and gobbled up the light and swallowed it and then belched it out in the\
  \ form of thick black poison fumes?\nPoor Tarleton was terrified, and in his terror\
  \ he turned on his heel and ran from the goblin, but he made only a half turn, so\
  \ no sooner did he begin to flee than he crashed into a towering pine, or a titanic\
  \ cedar, and came a -cropper, and the bash given to his head dislodged his brain\
  \ within its cranium, and he fell to the ground, and knew no more.\nHe might have\
  \ been dead. The peasant who found him, at daybreak, thought him so, and being a\
  \ gravedigging peasant, he hoisted his spade from over his shoulder and began to\
  \ dig a pit in which to chuck the body. He whistled as he dug, an ancient rustic\
  \ tune, and it was the sounds of his whistling and of his digging that woke Tarleton\
  \ from his stupor. He rubbed his bonce, but remembered nothing of what had happened\
  \ during the black unholy night. He did not even remember that he had been pursuing\
  \ a shifty pastry hawker.\n\u201CWhere am I?\u201D he asked, in an uncharacteristically\
  \ weedy and quavering voice, \u201CWhat place is this? What day is it? Why are you\
  \ digging a pit?\u201D\nThe peasant did not reply. He was an obtuse peasant, and\
  \ a peasant with a stubborn sense of purpose. Having begun to dig a grave by the\
  \ side of the lane in the shade of towering pines and titanic cedars, nothing would\
  \ stop him until he had shoved the body six feet under and covered it over with\
  \ earth. And here was a second instance of Tarleton's nincompoopery. Close observation\
  \ of the peasant's countenance, of the grim determination of his digging, might\
  \ have persuaded Tarleton to get to his feet and run, run away as fast as he could.\
  \ But he sat up, and lit his pipe, and listened to birdsong, and he was still sitting\
  \ and smoking and listening when the peasant, his digging done, threw down his spade\
  \ and turned and picked up Tarleton in one huge hairy hand by the scruff of his\
  \ neck and chucked him into the pit and retrieved his spade and began to shovel\
  \ spadeful after spadeful of soil and muck, rich with worms, over the amateur's\
  \ amateur, sprawled in the pit, and soon enough buried, never to be found..\nThe\
  \ peasant stamped his great boots on the grave, to smooth the ground and remove\
  \ all trace of his digging, and then, whistling, he went on his way.\nJust one thing.\
  \ If Tarleton was buried alive in an unmarked grave in an ill-lit lane in an area\
  \ of rustic squalor, how is it that his brain was retrieved and stored in jelly\
  \ in a jar in a display case in the lobby of Miss Blossom Partridge's Institute\
  \ For The Education Of Frighteningly Adept Tinies?\nAh. I could tell you a thing\
  \ or two about Miss Blossom Partridge, and certain members of staff at her Institute,\
  \ that would curdle the blood in your veins. Things innocent ears should never hear.\
  \ Remember the old saying, Ignorance is better by far When you see a brain in jelly\
  \ in a jar.\n[2013-04-18]"
