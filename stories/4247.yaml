text: "\u201CHis native land conquered, he had renamed himself the Great Wizard of\
  \ the North and headed south to London. John Henry [Anderson]'s magical repertoire\
  \ had grown accordingly, featuring egg-writing and an incomprehensible guinea pig\
  \ trick, and he started something of a trend when he had become the first magician\
  \ to pull a rabbit out of a hat\u2026 An unprecedented approach to advertising had\
  \ seen whole towns papered with playbills announcing the most extraordinary sounding\
  \ illusions, such as the \u2018Grand Metamorphesian Wonder\u2019 or the \u2018Phoenixestocalobian\u2019\
  \u2026 \_His tricks might be standard, but the language of his posters promised\
  \ something quite unique: \u2018A Grand Ambidexterological Illusion with 12 Handkerchiefs,\
  \ into which will be introduced the Enchanted Loaf and Learned Bottle, the Animated\
  \ Orange and the Invisible Pigeon\u2019. Not that anyone had the slightest idea\
  \ what that was supposed to mean, any more than they would have recognised a Phoenixestocalobian,\
  \ but that was just the point.\u201D\nPeter Lamont, The First Psychic\_: The Peculiar\
