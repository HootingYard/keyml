text: "If I am to take my bulging postbag as a reliable guide, one of the issues which\
  \ most taxes the contemporary Hooting Yardist is the impromptu dinner party. Here\
  \ is a letter received from reader Tim Thurn, which is all too typical of the sort\
  \ of thing I have to contend with:\nAll hail Mr Key! Like you, I am a Diogenesian\
  \ recluse. I shun not merely the hoi polloi but pretty much everyone else as well.\
  \ So you can imagine how taxing it is upon my poor curdled neurasthenic constitution\
  \ when, more often than I can bear, there comes of an evening an urgent hammering\
  \ at the door, which I open to reveal a gaggle of persons seeking succour.\n\u201C\
  Hello Tim me old mucker!\u201D one of them will cry, loud with bonhomie, \u201C\
  We thought we'd pop in for a chinwag and a bite to eat!\u201D\nThis is what passes\
  \ for good manners in our barbarous age. What is happening is that a vague acquaintance\
  \ whom I may recall having bumped into once or twice takes it upon himself to barge\
  \ in, accompanied by a raggle-taggle band of indigents, wastrels, and rascals. They\
  \ disport themselves about my home, as if invited, and I am placed in the position\
  \ of having to cobble together an impromptu dinner party.\nWhy, you might ask, do\
  \ I not simply shove them out of the door with curses and imprecations and, if necessary,\
  \ fisticuffs? Well, Mr Key, I was well-brought up, and taught always to be polite,\
  \ and to avoid scenes. Thus I feel compelled to provide what hospitality I can.\
  \ My question to you is, would you happen to know of a suitable recipe for such\
  \ an occasion?\nYours until the cows come home, Tim Thurn.\nIt seems Mr Thurn is\
  \ not the only Hooting Yardist who is plagued by sudden influxes of uninvited dinner\
  \ party guests. As I say, this sort of inquiry is all too common. Quite frankly,\
  \ I am sick to death of penning individual replies to these correspondents, so today,\
  \ in the hope that I can staunch the flow of letters, I have decided to post a recipe.\
  \ It is for a toothsome and filling meal, prepared from staple ingredients, which\
  \ can be knocked together to feed just about anybody who comes crashing through\
  \ your door.\nYou will need\_: a packet of Weetabix, a loaf of bread, and a bag\
  \ of croutons.\nFirst, remove all the outer packaging from the Weetabix. Then remove\
  \ any inner packaging. You should have six, twelve, eighteen, or God knows how many\
  \ pieces of Weetabix arrayed upon your countertop. Place the whole lot in a large\
  \ bowl, and smash them to bits. You can use a hammer, or a crusher, or a similar\
  \ implement. Just make sure that in smashing the Weetabix you do not also smash\
  \ the bowl, or you are going to have an awful mess to clean up. By the time you\
  \ are finished you should have a bowl full of tiny powdery Weetabix smithereens.\
  \ Put this to one side.\nNext, take the loaf of bread. It does not matter what kind\
  \ of bread it is. Get another bowl out of the cupboard. Now, tear the loaf to pieces,\
  \ letting the bits fall into the bowl. Keep tearing and ripping and rending until\
  \ you have a bowl full of breadcrumbs. If you have some kind of electrically-powered\
  \ mincing contraption, you might instead just want to feed the loaf into that. Either\
  \ way, the end result should be a bowl full of breadcrumbs. Put this to one side.\n\
  Now take another bowl out of the cupboard, open the bag of croutons, and tip the\
  \ entire contents into the bowl. Put this to one side. You will note that I recommend\
  \ buying readymade croutons rather than making your own. I am trying to save your\
  \ time, and in any case it is very doubtful that any of the indigents, wastrels,\
  \ and rascals will notice the difference. In the event that there are any sniffy\
  \ crouton wankers among your uninvited guests, chuck the telltale bag into the bin\
  \ along with the Weetabix packaging. There is always the possibility\u2014indeed,\
  \ the likelihood\u2014that some of the indigents, wastrels, and rascals will go\
  \ rummaging through your bin, so it is a good idea to cover over the Weetabix and\
  \ crouton packaging with cagmag. A favourite word of W H Auden's, cagmag is defined\
  \ in the OED as \u201Cunwholesome, decayed, or loathsome meat; offal ; hence anything\
  \ worthless or rubbishy\u201D. Clearly the more unwholesome, decayed, and loathsome\
  \ your cagmag the better, as it should deter even the most indefatigable bin-rummager.\n\
  Wipe the cagmag off your hands and return your attention to those three bowls. Get\
  \ another, bigger bowl out of the cupboard. Tip the crushed Weetabix, the breadcrumbs,\
  \ and the croutons together into this bowl, and stir. Stir! Stir! Stir! Stir until\
  \ the ingredients are thoroughly intermixed.\nCan be served hot or cold. Add a sprig\
  \ of parsley for colour.\nWhen I have served this dish, I have usually neglected\
  \ to provide my guests with any cutlery. They are thus forced to shovel it into\
  \ their mouths using their fingers. It is also a good idea not to have any beverages\
  \ in the house, and to cut off the water supply at the mains.\nIn the event of Weetabix\
  \ shortages, a perfect substitute is Shredded Wheat.\n[2012-08-15]"
