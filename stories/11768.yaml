text: "For Tim Henman\nI was walking along the towpath of the old canal when, suddenly\
  \ and out of nowhere, a maddened swan came flapping at me in stormy rage, and thumped\
  \ me so hard with its wing that it broke my arm.\n\u201CConfound you, swan!\u201D\
  \ I cried in my distress, but the swan had already returned to the canal, gliding\
  \ through the water, a vision of elegance.\nBy one of those curious coincidences\
  \ with which my life is stippled, the physician who tended to my fractured bone\
  \ at the canalside clinic was called Dr Swanfracture.\n\u201CI suppose you must\
  \ have to set quite a few bones broken by swans,\u201D I said, through the haze\
  \ of anaesthetic with which I had been, unnecessarily, injected.\n\u201CActually,\
  \ you are the first such patient I have had to attend to in twenty years of practice\
  \ at this clinic,\u201D said the doc, \u201CFor the swans on this canal are known\
  \ for their placidity. There is perhaps something in the canal water.\u201D\nLater,\
  \ convalescing, shattered on an Alpine balcony, I reflected on this, and my reflections\
  \ were unhappy ones. If Dr Swanfracture was correct, and the canal swans were placid,\
  \ then what had I done to provoke one of them to such uncharacteristic violent frenzy?\
  \ Or, was it not something I had done, but simply me, my being, my essential self?\
  \ Was I, without realising it, a danger to swans?\nA man can come undone when faced\
  \ with such an uncomfortable truth about himself, and I did indeed come undone.\
  \ I raved and spluttered and rolled about. It never occurred to me that Dr Swanfracture\
  \ was talking through his hat.\nMany years passed, the majority of them spent trussed\
  \ and medicated and bewildered in a series of lunatic asylums, before, one day,\
  \ I was visited by an ornithologist. This saintly chap was convinced that the mad\
  \ and the lunatic and the bewildered could be brought to their senses through a\
  \ better appreciation of birds. He it was who enlightened me regarding the ineradicable\
  \ savagery of swans. When I explained that there was something in the canal water\
  \ that made placid the swans that glid therein, he laughed, like a drain. When eventually\
  \ his gurgling ceased he said he had never heard such poppycock in his life. There\
  \ is no drug on earth, he said, that could pacify a swan. Indeed, his own studies\
  \ had shown that the only way to render a swan harmless was to wring its graceful\
  \ neck.\nDr Swanfracture's neck was anything but graceful. Rather, it was scrawny\
  \ and bepimpled and wrinkled, as I learned when I clamped my hairy hands around\
  \ it and wrung it, having stridden into the canalside clinic and through his waiting-room,\
  \ where sat several patients nursing swan-broken arms.\n[2013-07-21]"
