text: 'The always intriguing Strange Maps has a very useful map of Liechtenstein showing
  the eleven enclaves (some of which are possibly exclaves) into which that tiny principality
  is divided. They are (in alphabetical order) Balzers, Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Planken,
  Ruggell, Schaan, Schellenberg, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz.

  Tiny Enid is thought to have spent some time dwelling in a chalet in Planken, though
  no plaque or inscribed stone exists to mark what might, after all, be just a rumour
  put about those seeking to muddy the waters of the plucky tot''s biography, if a
  biography can be said to have waters. I shall have further words to say about those
  who sow confusion in the field of Tiny Enid life studies shortly, and they will
  be stern words, sulphurous ones, declaimed from a platform, a platform I hope to
  erect in Planken itself, or failing that, in Schaan or Balzers. The platform will
  be made from expensive wood, as you would expect, but the carpenters will be cheap,
  if I do my homework, which involves consulting a directory of Liechtensteinian carpenters
  and other woodworkers and ranking them according to price. Such an activity can
  becalm the most anguished of souls.
