text: "\u201CTo begin from the top: I have five sabre cuts on the crown of the head\
  \ and three on the left temple, all fractures from which much bone has come away;\
  \ one on my left cheek which fractured the jaw bone and has divided the ear, forming\
  \ a very unsightly wound; one over the right temple and a dreadful gash on the back\
  \ of the neck, which slightly grazed the windpipe; a musket ball in the hip, which\
  \ made its way through my back, slightly grazing the backbone; five sabre cuts on\
  \ my right arm and hand, three of the fingers broken, the hand cut three-fourths\
  \ across, and the wrist bones cut through; three cuts on the left arm, the bone\
  \ of which has been broken but is again uniting; one slight wound on the right leg\
  \ and two with one dreadful gash on the left, to say nothing of a cut across the\
  \ fingers of my left hand, now healed up.\u201D\nAlmost as an afterthought he added\
  \ that on arrival at Sidi el Muktar he had caught the plague\u2014\u201Ca dreadful\
  \ malady somewhat similar to yellow fever in its symptoms\u201D\u2014and had spent\
  \ nine days \u201Cso ill with fever that it was presumed, expected and hoped that\
  \ I should die\u201D. While he was sick most of his possessions, including his gun,\
  \ had been stolen and sent to be sold in the Timbuctoo market. \u201CI am nevertheless\
  \ doing well,\u201D he concluded, writing with only the thumb and middle finger\
  \ of his left hand, \u201Cand hope yet to return to England with much important\
  \ geographical information.\u201D\n\u2026 \u201CMy father used often to accuse me\
  \ of a want of common sense,\u201D he once confided to his sister, \u201C\u2018\
  Tis true, I never possessed any, nor ever shall.\u201D\nGordon Laing in Africa in\
