text: "The world of cornflakes is a world of cartons. It is hard to imagine one without\
  \ the other. Pepinstow tried and failed. That was his tragedy. It was less tragic\
  \ than some other tragedies that could have befallen him, but even so, even so.\
  \ It did for him. They found him slumped on the cold hard floor of a pantry, weeping.\
  \ He had made a cackhanded stab at cutting his own hair with a pair of garden shears.\
  \ With a big black bold indelible marker pen he had scrawled a word on his forearm,\
  \ an amateur tattoo that would, eventually, oh eventually, with enough soap and\
  \ water, be washed away. The word was CORNFLAKES.\nPepinstow could not recall when\
  \ first he became wholly, hopelessly immersed in the world of that particular breakfast\
  \ cereal. He did know that there had been a time when he had other interests. He\
  \ had been a keen stamp collector. On Saturdays he often took a pair of binoculars\
  \ and went out to peer at birds. He was on his way to becoming a leading authority\
  \ on Ford Madox Ford, or Ford Madox Brown, one of the Ford Madoxes in any case.\
  \ He was a dab hand with a badminton racquet.\nThen one day he was staying in an\
  \ insalubrious hotel at a seaside resort. Early in the morning, shortly after sunrise,\
  \ he crept down to the breakfast parlour. All his thoughts were concentrated on\
  \ kippers. He was a kippers-for-breakfast man, was Pepinstow, through thick and\
  \ thin. And thin times he had had, with a vengeance, yet always managed to procure\
  \ at least a kipper, or in extremis half a kipper, for his breakfast. But at that\
  \ seaside resort in that insalubrious hotel in that breakfast parlour on that day,\
  \ around the time of the Tet Offensive, Pepinstow's world changed.\n\u2013 Good\
  \ morning, sir, I trust you had a restful night?, said the hotelier.\nHe was a lanky\
  \ man with a walrus moustache and crumpled clothing,\n\u2013 I did indeed, thank\
  \ you, said Pepinstow, the bed was suitably hard, the walls did not shake, and I\
  \ was lulled to sleep by the sound of the sea sucking on the pebble-strewn beach.\
  \ Now I am ready for my kippers!\nThe hotelier's moustache drooped, and he adopted\
  \ an expression of hopeless grief.\n\u2013 I am sorry to say, sir, that toxin specialists\
  \ from a nearby facility called before dawn, and pronounced our kippers poisonous.\
  \ It seems a madcap serial killer is on the loose hereabouts. He must have broken\
  \ in to the hotel at dead of night, when you and I and all God's children were in\
  \ the land of Nod. He appears to have injected every single kipper in the hotel\
  \ with a lethal toxin.\nPepinstow's legs turned to jelly and he tottered towards\
  \ the mantelpiece to hold himself upright.\n\u2013 I'm afraid all I can offer you\
  \ for breakfast this morning is a bowl of cornflakes, said the hotelier.\nThings\
  \ were never the same for Pepinstow. Reluctantly, but then with increasing relish,\
  \ he tucked in to the cornflakes. What a breakfast!, he thought, What have I been\
  \ missing all these years, stuffing my gob with kippers? He was a man transformed.\
  \ Later, sitting on the pier, staring at the sea, he found his thoughts turning\
  \ again and again to cornflakes,\nSoon enough it was time to leave the seaside resort\
  \ and to head for an inland bailiwick, a rustic place of cows and wheat, and a shabby\
  \ guest-house in a shabbier village. Here he was delighted to find cornflakes on\
  \ the breakfast menu. By the time he moved on again, to a mountainous region of\
  \ thin crisp air and yodelling goatherds, he was a lost cause. He was a man in thrall\
  \ to cornflakes, mad with them. He neglected his stamp collection, gave up peering\
  \ at birds, forgot all he knew of Ford Madox Ford or Ford Madox Brown, and no longer\
  \ whacked a shuttlecock with his badminton racquet. His brain was utterly consumed\
  \ by cornflakes.\nFor years, Pepinstow only ever saw cornflakes in a bowl, served\
  \ and ready for the addition of milk from a jug. Where they sprung from he knew\
  \ not, though he spent much time and mental effort in wild conjecture. Were they\
  \ caught in nets in the sea, like kippers? Were they laid in coops by hens, like\
  \ eggs? Did they come fully-formed into the world, in their bowls, by an Act of\
  \ God?\nThen one day during John Major's first term of office, Pepinstow found himself\
  \ in a huge urban sprawl, in a massive hotel. When he crept down to breakfast, he\
  \ was alarmed\u2014it would be better to say he was unhinged\u2014to discover that\
  \ he had to serve himself, from a buffet. He gazed along the tables at the panoply\
  \ of breakfast items, but could see no cornflakes. He jabbered frantically at another\
  \ guest, who pointed out the carton. And so poor Pepinstow lost his wits.\nFrom\
  \ that day on, cornflakes and cartons became horribly entangled in his brain. That\
  \ is why they found him, slumped on the cold hard floor of a pantry, weeping. He\
  \ had made a cackhanded stab at cutting his own hair with a pair of garden shears.\
  \ With a big black bold indelible marker pen he had scrawled a word on his forearm,\
  \ an amateur tattoo that would, eventually, oh eventually, with enough soap and\
  \ water, be washed away. The word was CORNFLAKES.\n[2012-10-17]"
