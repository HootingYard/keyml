text: "The OED defines higgledy-piggledy as \u201Cwithout any order of position or\
  \ direction; in huddled or jumbled confusion and disorder; with heads and tails\
  \ in any or every direction. Usually contemptuous.\u201D An early citation, from\
  \ A new dictionary of the terms ancient and modern of the canting crew (1699) makes\
  \ explicit the reference to \u201Cheads and tails\u201D, defining the word as \u201C\
  all together, as Hoggs and Pigges lie\u201D. This pig-based etymology seems to me\
  \ to be thoroughly erroneous.\nMy own exhaustive and exhausting research has exhumed\
  \ from historical obscurity, you know what?, it has been so damnably exhausting\
  \ that I am going to have to break off here to take a nap. Assume several paragraphs\
  \ of zzzzzzzzzzs.\nThat's better. I am refreshed, and as if the nap were not enough\
  \ I have also glugged a teaspoon's-worth of Dr Baxter's Frenetic Brain Activity\
  \ Enhancement Cordial. So let us resume. My own exhaustive and exhausting research\
  \ has exhumed from historical obscurity Monsignor Higledi and Doctor Pigledie, the\
  \ one a priest and the other a physician. The spellings of their names are in accord\
  \ with the OED's earliest citation, from John Florio's A worlde of wordes, or most\
  \ copious, and exact dictionarie in Italian and English of 1598.\nIn 1492, or thereabouts,\
  \ the monsignor and the doctor were commissioned, by Bruno La Poubelle, to take\
  \ charge of the Keep Pointy Town Neat And Tidy campaign. This may seem anachronistically\
  \ modern, in both its intention and its phraseology, but Bruno La Poubelle was ever\
  \ a figure who transcended the petty bonds of time. Witness, for example, the well-known\
  \ portrait of him, etched by noted etcher Rex Van Etch, in which he is clearly depicted\
  \ wearing flying goggles and a Spandau Ballet tee-shirt.\nA visionary he may have\
  \ been, but Bruno La Poubelle made a terrible error of judgement in picking Higledi\
  \ and Pigledie. The one was a butterfingers and the other was passing strange in\
  \ a way we would today probably diagnose as clinical insanity. Which was which,\
  \ monsignor or physician, I have not yet been able to ascertain from the documents.\
  \ What they do make horribly vivid, however, is that no pair of fifteenth-century\
  \ Pointy Towners could have been less able to make, let alone keep, things neat\
  \ and tidy. Wherever they went, in those ancient boulevards, attempting to align\
  \ things neatly and clear away clutter and chaos, they only made things worse. By\
  \ the time Bruno La Poubelle put a stop to their activities, all of Pointy Town\
  \ was a jumble of confusion, with even well-defined pathways crumbled and leading\
  \ in jagged zigzags towards nothingness, or haystacks from the hinterland to be\
  \ found plopped upside down in the middle of the town square, or horses behind the\
  \ counters of pickle shops. There is a measure of truth in the observation that,\
  \ more than five hundred years later, Pointy Town has never quite recovered. That\
  \ is why, as soon as you enter the town, even today, you become lost, lost, oh hopelessly\
  \ lost.\nPigs have nothing to do with it.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this folderol,\
