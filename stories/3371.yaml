text: "He scraped at the bones with a xyster. He prodded them with his berubbergloved\
  \ fingers. He peered through a Coddington lens. He did tests, pH, Kleinwort-von\
  \ Straubenzee, etcetera. He broke for a cup of tea in the canteen. He sat alone,\
  \ reading a scientific bulletin. He examined graphs on screens. He checked the status\
  \ of a number of Petri dishes. He began to flag. He scribbled some notes in a pad.\
  \ He poked at the bones with a Copstone fork. He slipped a bone into his pocket.\
  \ He waited at the bus stop. It was raining. It was always raining. When he got\
  \ home he took the bone out of his pocket and added it to the pile by the fireplace.\
  \ He opened the fridge and poured a glass of milk. He sat in an armchair and contemplated\
  \ the pile of bones. There were bones from humans and dogs and rabbits and cows\
  \ and hens and pigs and ospreys and hamsters and larks and goats and ostriches and\
  \ bears and sheep and swordfish and gulls and deer and tanagers. He fetched a bale\
  \ of fusewire from a cupboard. He tied the bones together with the wire. He worked\
  \ slowly and with care. When he was done he leaned the bone-being against his mantelpiece\
  \ at an angle he thought insouciant. He plopped a hat on its head.\n\u201CAll hail,\
  \ Vabogadabingahobbema!\u201D he cried.\nHe placed a cardboard box filled with sand\
  \ at its lower talons as an offering. And he went out into his garden and sheltered\
  \ from the rain under an awning and smoked a cigarette. Like Ayn Rand, he considered\
  \ smoking to be man's victory over fire.\nWithin, the bone-being grew hot, glittering\
  \ in the firelight.\n[2009-11-03]"
