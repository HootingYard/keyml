text: "Another one from the archives\u2026\nHistorians of crime have long been fascinated\
  \ by the Birdbag family, whose exploits were regularly recorded in the penny dreadfuls\
  \ of their day. Seldom has such purple prose been so apt, for their deeds were truly\
  \ the last word in scampishness and mischief. To rekindle the memories of older\
  \ readers, and to introduce a new generation to this dastardly clan, here is a brief\
  \ guide.\n\_\n\nCorky Birdbag, the fiend who pushed a knock-kneed unfortunate into\
  \ a lake, and stole his bus ticket.\n\_\n\nPolly Birdbag, whose forgery of Selected\
  \ Poems by Walter Pater fooled a docent at the University of Ack.\n\_\n\nOld Ma\
  \ Birdbag, whose tunnels were so expertly dug that the police thought moles were\
  \ responsible.\n\_\n\_\n\nVenkad Birdbag, the so-called \u201CCardboard Hooter Man\u201D\
  , who hooted through a cardboard funnel.\n\_\n\_\n\nLoopy Birdbag, the woman who\
  \ sent consignments of boiled sweets to Stalin and Barbara Stanwyck at whim.\n\_\
  \n\_\n\nFontella Bass-Birdbag, the queasy maven of sabotage who did dark deeds with\
  \ a whisk and a pin-cushion.\n\_\n\_\n\nPark Fang Birdbag, desperate banjo player\
  \ who often stood next to nondescript ponds for no purpose but evil.\n\_\n\_\n\n\
  Smedley Birdbag, wanted by the police of four continents for doing something weird\
  \ with a toy pig sty.\n\_\n\_\n\_\n[2009-02-07]"
