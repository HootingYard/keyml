text: "Published in 1952, The Borrowers by Mary Norton was a children's book about\
  \ a race of tiny people who live undetected among normal human beings. They are\
  \ known as \u201Cborrowers\u201D because they survive, in part, by taking, or borrowing,\
  \ everyday objects from the human world and adapting them for their own use. The\
  \ novel was critically acclaimed, and was followed by a series of sequels over the\
  \ next thirty years. Its success completely overshadowed a similar series of books,\
  \ written during the same period, by Flossie Bint. The first of these, also appearing\
  \ in 1952, introduced us to the Snivellers.\nThe Snivellers tells the story of a\
  \ race of more-or-less human-sized beings who live, for the most part undetected,\
  \ among normal people. They are known as \u201Csnivellers\u201D because they go\
  \ around snivelling, without handkerchiefs. Sometimes they even whimper. They snivel\
  \ in a quite unselfconscious and morbidly annoying manner, day in day out, in all\
  \ sorts of circumstances. Much of the fun of the books\u2014well, not fun exactly,\
  \ let us instead call it mild diversion\u2014is that the normal humans seldom recognise\
  \ the Snivellers for what they are, a parallel race of super-snivelly handkerchiefless\
  \ beings consumed with self-pity.\nThe first book introduces us to a little family\
  \ of Snivellers, the couple Pob and Hoobety and their spirited teenage daughter\
  \ Agamemnonette. They snivel through over four hundred pages, in houses and barns\
  \ and bungalows and sheds and shacks and chalets, upon pavements and thoroughfares,\
  \ on the sea-battered strand and in fields and hills and frozen steppes, on weekdays\
  \ and public holidays, in the cold and the rain or on hot cloudless summer days.\
  \ Snivel, snivel, snivel, they go, with a whimper here and there to vary the tone.\n\
  Undeterred by her debut being comprehensively outsold by The Borrowers, Flossie\
  \ Bint followed up with a sequel in 1955. Alas, The Snivellers In A Sump was published\
  \ in the very same week as Mary Norton's own second book, The Borrowers Afield.\
  \ Though once again overlooked by all but a few, it marks a huge development, for\
  \ now the Snivellers are joined by a gaggle of anthropomorphic animals akin to those\
  \ in the tales written by Beatrix Potter. We meet Geoffrey the Beaver, Bob the Snail,\
  \ Cynthia the Horse, and Dagobert the Puff Adder. As this jolly quartet scurry and\
  \ slither and canter and creep through the book, the Snivellers snivel, sometimes\
  \ rather noisily. It is a tour de force.\nSeveral other Snivellers books followed,\
  \ barely selling enough to break even, and as she aged Flossie Bint became rancorous\
  \ and sour and difficult. She eventually died in a clapped-out boarding house at\
  \ a ruined seaside resort, snivelling like one of her timeless characters, without\
  \ even a handkerchief to her name.\n[2009-11-10]"
