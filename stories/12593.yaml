text: "The New World Order has come to pass. It has been decreed by the king that\
  \ from this day forth, the order of \u201CWorld\u201D should not be w-o-r-l-d, as\
  \ at present, but o-w-l-r-d. When a space is introduced between the l and the r,\
  \ we get Owl Rd, where Rd is a common abbreviation for Road. Thus the New World\
  \ Order is to be found along Owl Road, which is to be the new name for every single\
  \ road, street, avenue, crescent, mews, lane, path, you get the idea, throughout\
  \ the kingdom.\nThe usual moaning minnies have raised objections, chiefly the posties\
  \ and dustbin men and others whose duties require them to navigate the various roads\
  \ and streets. They\u2014or at least their representatives\u2014say that with every\
  \ road called Owl Road they will get lost, lost, hopelessly lost, and be unable\
  \ to perform their functions with due efficiency. To which the king says: \u201C\
  Pah!\u201D\nThat is one of the great things about being the king. You can wave your\
  \ begloved hand disdainfully and say \u201CPah!\u201D, and none dare challenge you.\
  \ The posties\u2019 and dustbin men's representatives made a little fuss, it is\
  \ true, but once the king had glared at them and spat his contempt, they knew better\
  \ than to persist. They returned to their depots like whipped curs, and held meetings\
  \ where they told the posties and the dustbin men to get to work, starting on Owl\
  \ Road.\n\u201CDon't worry your little proletarian heads about becoming hopelessly\
  \ lost,\u201D they were told, \u201CFor how can you be lost when, wherever you are,\
  \ you know you are on Owl Road?\u201D\nYou see how the king looks after his subjects?\
  \ In the New World Order, everybody knows exactly where they are, at every hour\
  \ of the day and the night. And that is a very fine state of affairs indeed.\nWritten\
  \ this day sitting on a municipal bench on Owl Road.\n[2014-04-01]"
