text: "\u201CAn interesting, though rather detestable, creature called the ant-lion\
  \ is found in some of the bestiaries of the Middle Ages\u2026 The ant-lion was so\
  \ called because of its size, since \u2018while to other animals it is only an ant,\
  \ to ants themselves it is as if it were a lion\u2019.\n\u201CAs an instance of\
  \ the implicit credulity of the Middle Ages witness this account of the ant-lion\
  \ given in the Physiologus. This states that the ant-lion's father was shaped like\
  \ a lion and his mother like an ant. The father was a flesh-eater; its mother herbivorous.\
  \ When these two had issue, this was the ant-lion, partaking of the features of\
  \ its parents, its forepart being that of a lion and its hindquarters like an ant.\
  \ Being thus composed the wretched insect could neither eat flesh like its father\
  \ nor herbs like its mother, and so it starved to death!\u201D\nColin Clair, Unnatural\
  \ History\_: An Illustrated Bestiary (1967). Alas, the ant-lion is not illustrated\
  \ in the book, and nor is the gigantic gold-digging pismire, with which it shares\
  \ a chapter.\n[2010-10-23]"
