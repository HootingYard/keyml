text: 'We already knew there was a hen called Tiny Enid. Now it has come to my attention
  that, in the USA, there is a Dalmatian puppy also named after the plucky tot. Matt
  and Mandy (whomsoever they may be) are to be congratulated on their excellent pet-naming
  skills. Visit their Drop My Straw blog and you can see both a photo and a video
  of the canine Tiny Enid.
