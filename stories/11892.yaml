text: "I have never been able to decide whether I prefer a sop or a fillip. To be\
  \ given a sop can be immediately gratifying. But when you are able, at leisure,\
  \ to consider what you really wanted, and then to be thunderstruck at the realisation\
  \ you have been fobbed off with a sop, gratification can curdle swiftly into frustration,\
  \ resentment, and, in certain circumstances, psychopathic violence. A fillip, on\
  \ the other hand, can come out of nowhere, unbidden, and set you up for the day,\
  \ or at least for a few minutes, until your innards are once again gnawed at by\
  \ whatever gnaws at them. That differs from person to person.\nThe tonic effects,\
  \ then, of both the sop and the fillip tend towards the ephemeral. One could argue\
  \ that, notwithstanding, the fillip is preferable. This is because, when it wears\
  \ off, and you are again plunged into remorseless misery, there is not the concomitant\
  \ dejection you get with the wearing off the sop, viz. the knowledge that you have\
  \ been fobbed off. You can't be fobbed off with a fillip. That is not in the nature\
  \ of fillips, though it is part and parcel of the sop.\nWe can perhaps grasp this\
  \ more firmly by considering a concrete example. Here is Dobson, from his pamphlet\
  \ What I Have To Say, In Toto, About Sops And Fillips (out of print):\nIt was a\
  \ day in that blue month September, silent beneath the plum trees\u2019 slender\
  \ shade. A nice juicy Carlsbad plum, I thought, would be just the fillip I needed.\
  \ It so happened that I was plunged in remorseless misery and my innards were being\
  \ gnawed at by their intractable enemies, a legion of mental and emotional horrors\
  \ it would take far too long to list. Yes, the more I thought about it, sprawled\
  \ beneath the plum trees\u2019 slender shade, the more I craved the fillip I would\
  \ get from munching one of those plums.\nI have never been the sprightliest of tree-climbers,\
  \ but on that day in that blue month September it so happened that I was wearing\
  \ my Bolivian Rain Forest Warden's Tree-Climbing Boots. What a happy accident! I\
  \ stood up, dusted the duff from my duffel coat, and prepared to clamber a little\
  \ way up the trunk of the plum tree, just high enough to pluck a plum. It was a\
  \ strangely tall plum tree, as were all its fellows in this orchard.\nJust as I\
  \ was about to begin my climb, I was disconcerted to see, striding towards me, aiming\
  \ a shotgun, the orchardist. I knew he was the orchardist because of his proprietorial\
  \ manner of striding across the loam, and the badge affixed to his duffel coat,\
  \ over his heart.\n\u201COi!\u201D he shouted, \u201CDo not think for one minute\
  \ you can climb and pluck a plum of mine from my plum tree!\u201D\n\u201CNothing\
  \ was further from my mind,\u201D I lied, \u201CI am not the plum-eating type.\u201D\
  \nHe shoved the barrel of his shotgun into my belly.\n\u201CI'm pleased to hear\
  \ it,\u201D he said, \u201COften I find picnickers and other reprobates lurking\
  \ in my orchard who think the munching of a nice juicy Carlsbad plum is just the\
  \ fillip they need to wrench them, albeit temporarily, out of their misery and horrors.\u201D\
  \n\u201CDon't you fret about me on that score,\u201D I said, \u201CI am as happy\
  \ as a lark.\u201D\nThis ornithological sally was a blatant fib, as my countenance\
  \ was downcast and gloomy. It served, however, to bamboozle the orchardist. He hoisted\
  \ the shotgun over his shoulder and mumbled something about the nesting habits of\
  \ larks.\nI thought it best to skedaddle out of the orchard and find somewhere else\
  \ to slump on that day in that blue month September. As I trudged along the towpath\
  \ of the old canal, past the cement works and the marmalade factory, I still craved\
  \ the fillip of a plum to munch. Pausing to sit on a canalside bench placed there\
  \ in honour of Robert Fripp, I took from the inside pocket of my duffel coat the\
  \ Gazetteer of Fruiterers which, in those days, I always carried with me. If I could\
  \ not steal a plum from an orchard, I could buy one from a fruiterer! I was young\
  \ then, you see, and my brain was in proper working order.\nHaving ascertained that\
  \ the nearest fruiterer was a short bus ride away, I made my way to the bus stop\
  \ and waited for a bus. When the bus arrived, I boarded it. I sat down. The bus\
  \ conductor took my fare. Peering out of the window at the sky, I became lost in\
  \ thought about my imminent plum. I could almost taste it. What a fillip it would\
  \ be!\nShortly afterwards I alighted from the bus at another bus stop and crossed\
  \ the road to enter the fruiterers\u2019. He was a curiously monkey-like man, though\
  \ his manners were polished.\n\u201CHow may I be of assistance to you on this day\
  \ in that blue month September?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CI would like to buy a nice\
  \ juicy Carlsbad plum, please,\u201D I said.\n\u201CI am afraid I sold my last plum,\
  \ Carlsbad or no, just fifteen minutes ago to a communist German playwright,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CSo may I recommend instead a conference pear?\u201D\nThere would\
  \ be no fillip for me. Instead, I was being fobbed off with a sop!\nCareful study\
  \ of this passage will reward the reader with a dazzling insight into the fillip\
  \ and the sop, and this in spite of the fact that Dobson does not tell us whether\
  \ he accepted the fruiterer's offer of a conference pear. It was long thought that\
  \ he addressed this in his pamphlet The Blue September Of Conference Pears (out\
  \ of print), but recent textual exegesis by hot-headed young Dobsonist Ted Cack\
  \ demonstrates pretty damn conclusively that the September referred to in that pamphlet\
  \ was after, not before, the Tet Offensive.\n[2013-08-28]"
