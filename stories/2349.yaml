text: "We have learned, in recent years, to be on our guard against the terrors of\
  \ bird flu. Those who cannot avoid handling hens now ensure they wear full protective\
  \ body armour when doing so, and the rest of us steer clear of members of the hen\
  \ community at all times. Here at Hooting Yard we have been at the forefront of\
  \ a campaign to address the particular perils faced by those who have pet swans.\
  \ General avoidance of birds is well nigh impossible, given their tendency to swoop\
  \ and perch and paddle and nest pretty much wherever they like, but with judicious\
  \ use of netting and frighteners and wild gesticulations of the limbs, most of us\
  \ have been able to keep ourselves safe. Predictions of a world ruled by flu-ridden\
  \ crows and cassowaries and nightjars, common enough at the turn of the century,\
  \ have proved to be alarmist twaddle.\nNow we face a new danger. As I mentioned\
  \ yesterday, it is no longer just birds we need to worry about, but pigs too. Virulent\
  \ strains of so-called swine flu threaten to engulf us. This brings with it new\
  \ problems, not the least being a wholesale rethinking of the practice of becalming\
  \ our boiling brains through lengthy contemplation of pigs while leaning against\
  \ the fence of a sty. As a tried and tested relaxation technique, pig contemplation\
  \ is unsurpassed. It has been estimated that several wars have been averted through\
  \ its organised application, and readings on a pneumatic belligerometer confirm\
  \ its effectiveness. Any outbreak of swine flu will thus be devastating, with fizzing\
  \ cranial disturbances inside people's heads having no easy remedy. I am not referring\
  \ here only to countryside persons, for there are innumerable urban pigsties where\
  \ mental relief can be sought\u2026 or could be sought before this new and terrifying\
  \ development.\nAt a special conference to be held at the Blister Lane Bypass Pig\
  \ Study Building Hub, a panel of boffins will be devising ways to counter the threat.\
  \ Until they release the results of their deliberations in the form of handy pamphlets,\
  \ try not to go near any pigs. However, if you are the sort of person for whom traffic\
  \ with pigs is unavoidable, a course of Dr Baxter's Antipig Calmative tablets is\
  \ recommended. Take a dozen daily, with a bowl of cornflakes, and do not in any\
  \ circumstances operate heavy machinery, such as one of those mechanical pig hoists\
  \ we've been hearing so much about in the hoisting-and-winching press.\n[2009-04-25]"
