text: "The super soaraway Dabbler is rapidly proving to be the one thing (apart from\
  \ Hooting Yard of course\u2026 so make that one of the two things) that justifies\
  \ the very existence of het internet, so it pains me to have to chuck a brickbat,\
  \ but chuck a brickbat I must. Quite frankly, it passeth all understanding that\
  \ a postage with the promising title Important monkey / flying squirrel insight\
  \ news signally fails to mention Dobson's ground-breaking pamphlet A Detailed Account\
  \ Of How I Provided Emergency Medical Assistance, Despite Having Not A Jot Of Training,\
  \ To A Flying Squirrel Exhausted And Maimed After Being Pursued And Attacked By\
  \ A Small Tough-Guy Japanese Macaque Monkey Which Mistook It For A Predatory Bird,\
  \ With Several Diagrams And An Afterword Quoting A Jethro Tull Song Lyric (out of\
  \ print).\nWe tend not to think of the great pamphleteer as the sort of chap to\
  \ dispense succour to small wounded animals. After all, he was much more likely\
  \ to throw pebbles at swans, or to rain imprecations down upon puppies. But painstaking\
  \ research has shown that the \u201Cdetailed account\u201D he gives is absolutely\
  \ factual. What happened was that Dobson took a detour through a monkey and squirrel\
  \ sanctuary while on his way home from a visit to Hubermann's, that most gorgeous\
  \ of department stores, where he had bought a large supply of bandages and liniment.\
  \ His purchases were made with a distinct purpose, for sloshing around in his head\
  \ was the idea of writing a pamphlet about bandages and liniment as part of a projected\
  \ series with the collective title Various Things You Can Smear On Wounds And Various\
  \ Methods Of Protecting Wounds From The Elements. According to his notes, there\
  \ were to be at least twelve pamphlets in the series, but not a single one was ever\
  \ written, possibly because of the turn of events in the monkey and squirrel sanctuary.\n\
  Close to the perimeter fence, Dobson chanced upon a mewling and maimed flying squirrel,\
  \ and saw a small Japanese macaque monkey scampering away with squirrel blood dripping\
  \ from its gob. The pamphleteer put two and two together. Then, quite out of character,\
  \ he knelt down, applied liniment to the gashes on the flying squirrel, and enwrapped\
  \ it in bandages. He had a mind to take it home to Marigold Chew, as a prospective\
  \ pet to replace her recently deceased weasel. Alas, so thoroughly did Dobson apply\
  \ the bandages that the flying squirrel was suffocated.\nThe pamphleteer chose a\
  \ spot close to the Blister Lane Bypass and buried the flying squirrel in a shallow\
  \ grave. Every day, for weeks afterwards, he visited to place a sprig of dahlias\
  \ or lupins on the plot, and he wept. He never told Marigold Chew what he had done,\
  \ and it seems that she never got round to reading the pamphlet, one of the few\
  \ works of Dobson to be commercially printed rather than typeset and cranked out\
  \ on Marigold Chew's Gestetner machine.\nThe quotation from Jethro Tull which appears\
  \ on the last page of the pamphlet, by the way, is \u201CSo! Where the hell was\
  \ Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?\u201D from Thick As A Brick. Its significance\
  \ to the text it accompanies has eluded every Dobsonist who has tried to winkle\
  \ some meaning from it. I suppose that is one of the reasons we still read Dobson\
  \ today. He continues to challenge us.\n[2010-08-10]"
