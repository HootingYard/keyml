text: "There seem to be a few vaporous stirrings within the Key head, so it is not\
  \ entirely vacant. Those stirrings may yet lead to some sweeping pargraphs of majestic\
  \ prose. Meanwhile, here is a piece that first appeared on this day nine years ago:\n\
  Devoted readers of Hooting Yard\u2014are there any other kind?\u2014know that we\
  \ do our utmost to bring you the very, very best in modern, cutting-edge soup recipes.\
  \ As part of the latest tranche, here is a marvellous example, provided by Dr Ruth\
  \ Pastry's sister Maud:\nIngredients: 1 lb each of apricots, breadcrumbs, coleslaw,\
  \ dandelions, edelweiss stalks, flapjacks and goldfish brains; 6 tbsp honey; 2 oz\
  \ isinglass; 1 lb each of jackdaw feathers, ketchup, love-lies-bleeding, marmalade,\
  \ nougat and oxlips; 1 pea; 1 tub quicklime; 4 oz each of raisins*, spikenard and\
  \ toffee; 15 tsp unspeakable goo; 1 family-size catering pack of vinegar; 3 whelks;\
  \ as much xanthium as you can stomach; 12 pkts yeast; 44 zinnias.\nMethod: Pound\
  \ everything beginning with a vowel into a mulch. Smear it on to the inside of a\
  \ big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for a week. Cut\
  \ everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby's fist, then chargrill.\
  \ Go and get the bowl and toss the chunks in haphazardly. Place the bowl under an\
  \ outside spigot and fill to the brim with water. Leave to stand for as long as\
  \ you like, depending on how hungry you are. Transfer to a cauldron. Bring to the\
  \ boil and allow to simmer. Pour in some milk. Re-boil, indefatigably. Ladle off\
  \ the scum from the top. Serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa.\n* NOTE : The mention\
  \ of raisins in Maud Pastry's recipe prompts me to quote this splendid passage from\
  \ Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered The World (Fourth Estate):\nIf [Islamic\
  \ fundamentalist suicide-bombers] die in the struggle, so much the better\u2014\
  since they will be welcomed into paradise by seventy-two virgins, ready to satisfy\
  \ every sensual need. (This titillating inducement may not be all it seems. A scholarly\
  \ new Koranic study by Christoph Luxenberg suggests that the legend of the virgins\
  \ is based on a misinterpretation of the word hur, which translates from Arabic\
  \ as \u2018houris\u2019 but in the Syriac language meant \u2018white raisins\u2019\
  . Imagine the disappointment of a suicide-bomber who arrives in heaven expecting\
  \ a bevy of gorgeous maidens, \u2018chaste as hidden pearls\u2019, only to be offered\
  \ a bowl of dried grapes instead.)\n[2013-04-08]"
