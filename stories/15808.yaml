text: "\nYou will be wanting to know what prize Lars Talc found at the end of Bewg's\
  \ treasure trail. It was a minuscule horn, or tusk, which\u2014according to the\
  \ hand-written leaflet in which it was enwrapped\u2014held certain talismanic properties.\
  \ It was little bigger than the nail of Talc's little finger, and was burnt sienna\
  \ in colour.\nHorn is different from bone. It is composed of coagulated, or thickened,\
  \ albumen, gelatine, and phosphate of lime. It contains just enough of the lime\
  \ to make it hard without being too brittle, and just enough of gelatine to render\
  \ it easily cut and moulded when heated.\nMost horns have a bony core, which is\
  \ got out by soaking them in water for five or six weeks. This core can be ground\
  \ up and made into little crucibles called cupels, used for melting gold and silver\
  \ in. The tips of the horns, which are solid, are then sawn off, to be used for\
  \ knife handles, buttons, &c. The remainder, or hollow part, is easily softened\
  \ by soaking it in boiling duckpond water for half an hour, when it is slit open\
  \ with a knife, spread out flat, and pressed between monstrous iron plates. If the\
  \ \u201Cflats\u201D, as they are called, are pressed very hard, they can easily\
  \ be separated into several thin plates, which are scraped and smoothed and sometimes\
  \ put into lanterns instead of glass. In olden times horn plates were used for window-glass.\
  \ In the manufacture of combs and other things, horn is pressed but little, as too\
  \ much pressure causes the teeth to split. It is easily coloured so as to look like\
  \ tortoiseshell, from which sometimes it can be scarcely distinguished.\nHorn when\
  \ heated can be moulded into almost any shape, which it will keep when cold. In\
  \ making knife and fork handles, buttons, and other small things, the pieces are\
  \ cut of the right size, softened in hot water, and then screwed up in moulds, which\
  \ shape the horn and press upon it any letters or figures that may be on the inside\
  \ of the moulds. In about twenty minutes the horn is taken out and is then ready\
  \ to be polished, which is done with rotten stone and oil.\nLars Talc's prize horn,\
  \ however, had been subjected to no such manufactory impulses, and Bewg's leaflet\
  \ warned that it must remain whole, and pristine, or it would no longer serve as\
  \ a talisman.\nThe various lights under which a horn may be looked at have given\
  \ rise to a vast number of words in language, not just Finnish. Horn may be regarded\
  \ as a projection, a climax, a badge of strength, power, or vigour, a tapering body,\
  \ a spiral, a waxy object, a bow, a vessel to hold withal or to drink from, a smooth\
  \ hard material not brittle, stony, metallic, or wooden, something sprouting up,\
  \ something to thrust or push with, a sign of honour or pride, &c.\nFrom the shape,\
  \ we find words such as kernel and granum, grain and corn. From the curve of a horn,\
  \ corona and crown. From the spiral, crinis, meaning ringlets or locks. From its\
  \ being the highest point comes our crown, perhaps, in the sense of the top of the\
  \ head. For its sprouting up and growing, we have keren, cornu, cresco, grandis,\
  \ grass, great, groot. For its curving, curvus is probably from the root horn in\
  \ one of its forms. Corvus, cornix, and crow (perhaps also raven, which may have\
  \ been craven) bear a striking resemblance to cornu and curvus. So also crane, heron,\
  \ and herne. Why these birds should derive their names from horn we cannot presume\
  \ to say. The tree cornel is said to derive its name from the hard horn-like nature\
  \ of its wood, and the corns of the foot perhaps for the same reason. Corner is\
  \ so called from its shape. Possibly, although unlikely, grin may mean to curve\
  \ up the ends of the mouth like horns. In Switzerland, they call a mountain horn.\
  \ Herna is a horn-like crag. And what are we to make of hoon?\nSarvi, torvi, and\
  \ tuntosarvi are Finnish words for horn.\nBewg's leaflet did not describe in any\
  \ detail how the tiny burnt sienna horn acted as a talisman. In any case, all forms\
  \ of superstition were anathema to Lars Talc, who had devoted one of his more uproarious\
  \ essays to the subject. And yet he was extremely pleased with his prize, and carried\
  \ it with him where'er he roamed during the final two weeks of his life.\n[2017-10-17]"
