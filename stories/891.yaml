text: "Quite apart from anything else, the dimwits and barbarians have clearly overlooked\
  \ the fact that \u201CLatin and Greek are the only tongues in which departed spirits\
  \ can be addressed, for this reason they are denominated the dead languages. The\
  \ nonappearance of these supernatural beings in the present day, may be fairly ascribed\
  \ to the decay of the learned languages.\u201D The anonymous contributor to The\
  \ Mirror Of Taste, And Dramatic Censor, Volume I, Number 5 knew this much in May\
  \ 1810, so the elected representatives of Bournemouth and Salisbury Councils and\
  \ the unelected dullards at the Plain English Campaign ought to know it too. Perhaps\
  \ if they wander down to their local Andy Burnham Chat \u2018n\u2019 Snack Zone\
  \ before all the books disappear they might learn something.\n[2008-11-03]"
