text: "\u201CKitchen Groanings addressed to the Parlour\_: a pamphlet so called, published\
  \ fifty years ago. It is the spirited remonstrance of some angry cook-wench, or\
  \ discontented housemaid, against lazy footmen with their ruffles, their canes,\
  \ their bags, and powdered heads, who run away with the pecuniary perquisites, or,\
  \ as they were at that period called, vails, without having their due proportion\
  \ of the hard work of the house. This publication is said to have been actually\
  \ produced by one of the sisterhood, whose cause it pleads; and, considering the\
  \ quarter from whence it issued, is not badly written.\u201D\nFrom Anecdotiana;\
  \ or, A Library of Anecdote. Facts and Opinions, Historical, Biographical, Critical\
  \ &c. Collected and Recorded by An Eminent Literary Character (I. J. Chidley, London\
  \ 1841)\nI am not quite sure, but I think Dobson may have produced a Kitchen Groanings\
  \ pamphlet of his own.\n[2009-02-14]"
