text: "\n(To the tune of Oh Bring Me Your Winding-Sheet, Mother Of Mine)\nMy name\
  \ is P.V.Glob\n  I wrote a book about a bog\n  \u201CBog\u201D spelled backwards\
  \ is \u201CGob\u201D\n  And that is the name of my dog\nIn Russian, \u201CGod\u201D\
  \ is \u201CBog\u201D\n  And my dog Gob's a dog-god\n  He sleeps all day like a log\n\
  \  For a dog he's a lazy sod\nI walk Gob to the bog\n  To wake him from his snooze\n\
  \  I can't see the bog for the fog\n  But I hear the cows\u2019 plaintive moos\n\
  There are, you see, cows near the bog\n  And one of them is a cow-god\n  A god like\
  \ Gog and Magog\n  Gods who are really quite odd\nSo slumped in the muck by the\
  \ bog\n  Invisible because of the fog\n  There's me, the writer P.V.Glob\n  And\
  \ my little pet doggie, Gob\nHe is by no means a fearsome hound\n  Wait! What's\
  \ that uncanny sound?\n  It's the sound of the cow-god's bog-side mooing\n  The\
  \ sound of my and Gob's undoing.\n[2013-02-08]"
