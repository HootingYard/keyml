text: "An exciting tale of soup and woodland peril from the Funny Old World column\
  \ in the latest issue of Private Eye:\n\u201CIt all started because the soup was\
  \ too cold,\u201D sixty-nine-year-old Yuri Ticiuc told reporters from his hospital\
  \ bed in the remote Russian republic of Altai, \u201Cand I complained about it to\
  \ my wife. The complaint turned into a row about her lousy cooking, and I got so\
  \ angry with her that I stormed out of the house, and out into the woods. I walked\
  \ and walked for hours through the dense woodlands, until I gradually calmed down,\
  \ and when I did, the truth started to dawn on me. I was in the middle of the forest\
  \ in the middle of winter, I didn't have any idea where I was, and I couldn't find\
  \ my way back home.\u201D\nTiciuc was speaking after being lost in frozen forest\
  \ for more than a month. \u201CI thought I was going to die. The temperatures were\
  \ sub-zero, and I was getting really weak by the end. I survived by eating berries\
  \ and leaves, and grain from a haystack, until I became too weak to move. Then one\
  \ day I heard voices and saw some farm workers nearby. I called them and they managed\
  \ to get me to hospital. The doctors tell me I'm lucky to be alive, but they may\
  \ have to amputate my legs. They're damaged from frostbite, and it may not be possible\
  \ to save them.\n\u201CNo matter what happens in future, that's the last time I\
  \ ever criticise my wife's cooking. Her soup may be cold and tasteless, but anything\
  \ is better than rotten hay.\u201D\n[2012-06-22]"
