text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, I read yesterday's piece about nisbet spotting\
  \ and put two and two together. I think the \u201Chapless enthusiasts\u201D of the\
  \ Nisbet Spotting Society were seeking high and low for that odd being depicted\
  \ in the Hooting Yard \u201Cimplausible\u201D emblem, as shown in the heading of\
  \ your website and on those fetching lapel accoutrements. My unpaid intern research\
  \ assistants tell me that the emblem first appeared, in black and white, on the\
  \ cover of an edition of the ReR Quarterly magazine in the late 1980s, cheek by\
  \ jowl with several other emblems. If this is the case, then in terms of simple\
  \ chronology it would have been impossible for nisbet spotters of the early 1970s\
  \ to spot it, as it did not yet exist. Had you had a bit of stamina and kept up\
  \ regular production of the Official Journal of the Nisbet Spotting Society, those\
  \ hapless enthusiasts would not, with the passing of time, have been quite so hapless.\
  \ Yours indefatigably, Dr Ruth Pastry.\n\nDr Pastry is correct about the provenance\
  \ of the emblem. If any reader has a copy of the magazine in question, perhaps they\
  \ would be good enough to scan both front and back covers and send them to Mr Key.\
  \ On the question of whether or not the \u201Codd being\u201D is indeed a nisbet,\
  \ I think it best to reserve judgement until a panel of experts has been empanelled\
  \ to consider the matter with due diligence.\n[2011-09-15]"
