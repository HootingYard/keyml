text: "Zamoyski is adept at painterly scene-setting. One vivid paragraph shows the\
  \ Paris revolution of 1848, which sent King Louis Philippe scurrying into exile\
  \ and ignited populist insurrections across Europe, as caused by a clumsy bandsman\
  \ with a big drum. After a day of innocuous, anti-climactic Paris demonstrations,\
  \ a company of soldiers stationed on a boulevard corner tried to retreat from a\
  \ rowdy but hardly murderous crowd into the courtyard of the ministry of foreign\
  \ affairs. They were blocked because the musician carrying the drum got jammed in\
  \ the porte-coch\xE8re of the ministry. As a result some soldiers had to turn and\
  \ face the crowd, grew rattled, and fired shots that left over 30 dead. The mangled\
  \ corpses were piled onto a wagon, which was trundled through the streets of Paris\
  \ by rabble-rousers crying for revenge. It was the drummer, rather than the previous\
  \ uprisings in Palermo and Naples, and the granting of constitutions in Sicily,\
  \ Sardinia and Tuscany, that triggered the continent-wide uprisings of 1848.\nRupert\
  \ Davenport-Hines reviewing Phantom Terror: The Threat of Revolution and the Repression\
  \ of Liberty, 1789\u20141848 by Adam Zamoyski in The Spectator.\n[2014-10-19]"
