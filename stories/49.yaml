text: "Old Russia had only one tsar at a time, but now of course we have many of them,\
  \ each with their own speciality, like patron saints. Traffic tsars, drugs tsars,\
  \ respect tsars\u2026 every week some bug-eyed government wonk creates yet another\
  \ tsardom. Such power!\nApparently, Blodgett used to be a tsar, for a few weeks.\
  \ It was a gorgeous summer afternoon, and he was putting the finishing touches to\
  \ his sleek gas-powered \xFCberpod when one of those bug-eyed government wonks came\
  \ prancing up the path, out of nowhere. Blodgett put down his rag on a pile of other\
  \ rags, dipped his hairy hands into a tub of swarfega, and wiped them on one of\
  \ the other rags from the pile, or perhaps on the one he had just dropped. He adjusted\
  \ his lorgnette with exquisite daintiness and looked the wonk over, as if he were\
  \ examining a beetle. Blodgett had history with wonks, as they say, and he was prepared\
  \ for anything.\n\u201CYou are Blodgett?\u201D asked the wonk, in a wonky monotone.\n\
  Blodgett was tempted to curl his lip, but he was still wearing a protective cotton\
  \ dimity thing over his nose and mouth, so instead he nodded his assent.\n\u201C\
  We need to appoint a cow byre tsar,\u201D announced the wonk, without preamble,\
  \ \u201CAnd your name has been put forward. There is a modest stipend and an armband.\
  \ Congratulations.\u201D\nIf the wonk said anything else, his words were wasted,\
  \ for he was drowned out by the sudden appearance of swooping corncrakes. Blodgett\
  \ ushered him into his hut and put the kettle on.\n\u201CWhat does the job involve?\u201D\
  \ he asked, his booming voice only slightly muffled by the dimity thing.\n\u201C\
  Oh, you know, just go and hang around cow byres being sort of tsary,\u201D replied\
  \ the wonk.\nWhat Blodgett was not told was that he was expected to send in daily\
  \ reports, including the Latin names of the cows in each byre he fell upon, looming\
  \ in his fierce Blodgettian way in the shadows. An added difficulty was that all\
  \ the cows he visited seemed to twinkle, like stars in the heavens. His first report\
  \ was sent back to him, his lovely handwriting virtually obliterated by comments\
  \ and corrections scribbled with an impossibly thick black magic marker pen. Blodgett\
  \ wept that night, huge convulsive sobs wracking his frame as he crouched next to\
  \ the \xFCberpod. His second and third reports fared no better, so he stopped sending\
  \ them. And nothing happened. Each morning, as dawn broke, he would don his cow\
  \ byre tsar armband and stride out towards yet another cow byre of twinkling cows,\
  \ and loom, tsarily, for hours upon end, before returning home to his soup and his\
  \ fireside. No word came from the wonk, for the wonk wed his sweetheart and fled\
  \ to a city of curious puddles and gigantic towers of granite, and he never again\
  \ thought much about cows, twinkling or otherwise. And after a few weeks, nor did\
  \ Blodgett. He put his cow byre tsar armband on his pile of rags, and soon it was\
  \ smeared with swarfega, just another Blodgett rag.\nPostscript. Six months later,\
  \ Blodgett's hut was crushed by a stampede of twinkling cows. He was out at the\
  \ time.\n[2007-02-14]"
