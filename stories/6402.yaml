text: "\u2018Twas on this day in the year Two Thousand and Four\nMr Key came a-knocking\
  \ at a filthy black door.\nThe door was in Denmark Street off the Charing Cross\
  \ Road\nWhere the Sex Pistols rehearsed and punk rock did explode.\nBut now behind\
  \ the door was a radio station,\nBy far the finest in the entire nation.\nFor this\
  \ was the home of Resonance FM,\nA radiophonic treasure, a jewel, a gem.\nAs Mr\
  \ Key did upon the black door knock\nThe time was approaching four o clock.\nA buzzer\
  \ buzzed, and in he stepped\nInto a hallway that had never been swept.\nThen through\
  \ to a back room where laptops did hum\n\u201CMr Key\u201D said a fellow, \u201C\
  Thank God you have come!\u201D\nHe was tall and bearded was this man,\nThe then\
  \ station manager Knut Aufermann.\nIn a corner a bucket caught leaks from the ceiling\n\
  And upon the walls the paint was peeling.\nIt was a squalid place for sure\n(Resonance\
  \ is not based there any more.)\n\u201CI am here to broadcast my first ever radio\
  \ show,\u201D\nSaid Mr Key. Said Knut \u201CYes, I know.\nYou must clamber up that\
  \ narrow stair\nAnd when you get to the top please beware\nThe floor above is close\
  \ to collapse\nIt will last another year or two perhaps.\u201D\nSo up the stairs\
  \ climbed Mr Key\nWhere he met a man called Malachi.\n\u201CHello,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201CI'm your sound engineer.\nMy job's to ensure the audience can hear\nThe\
  \ sensible prose you're going to spout\nAs our transmitter beams it out\nTo all\
  \ four corners of the planetary sphere.\nIt is nearly time, so sit down here.\u201D\
  \nHe proffered a chair that was falling to bits,\nBut Mr Key sat and gathered his\
  \ wits\nHe cleared his throat and tested the microphone\nAnd he started to speak\
  \ in mellifluous baritone\n\u201CThis is Hooting Yard On the Air,\u201D he said.\n\
  Indeed it was. And those seven words led\nTo seven whole years of Hooting Yard shows\n\
  To hours and hours of lopsided prose\nFor the moral instruction of a grateful nation\n\
  On the world's most astonishing radio station.\nAnd the shows are not lost in the\
  \ dust of the past\nHundreds can be heard in the form of podcast\nYet \u2018twas\
  \ babble o\u2019 the future when he knocked on that door\nOn the fourteenth of April,\
  \ Two Thousand and Four.\n\nThe first ever episode of Hooting Yard On The Air will\
  \ be repeated on Resonance104.4FM today ay 6.30 PM. A podcast will be available\
  \ for download in the near future.\n[2011-04-14]"
