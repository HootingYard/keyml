text: "In Maryland, Whittaker Chambers pointed across the fields towards his pumpkin\
  \ patch. Beside him, Alger Hiss peered uncertainly through the morning mist.\n\u201C\
  There, Hiss,\u201D said Chambers, \u201CYou can see my pumpkin patch?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Barely, Chambers, barely. It is a misty morning,\u201D said Hiss.\n\u201CLet us\
  \ go then, you and I,\u201D said Chambers.\nUnlike the shabby Whittaker Chambers,\
  \ Alger Hiss was dressed elegantly, and he worried that his expensive shoes would\
  \ become caked with the Maryland mud through which, perforce, he must squelch to\
  \ reach the pumpkin patch.\n\u201CI am worried that my expensive shoes will become\
  \ caked in mud, Chambers,\u201D he said.\n\u201COh, don't you worry your little\
  \ Hiss head about that,\u201D said Chambers, \u201CIt is wooden mud, that is, mud\
  \ cleverly carved from wood, to give the appearance of mud. Your expensive shoes\
  \ will remain clean and shiny, or my name is not Whittaker Chambers!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Or indeed George Crosley,\u201D said Hiss.\n\u201CDammit, Hiss!\u201D hissed Chambers,\
  \ rounding on his alleged pal, \u201CDon't speak the name I use when spying for\
  \ the Soviets, even here in this rustic neck of Maryland! Remember that our capitalist\
  \ government has agents fanned out across the land. Why, even that scarecrow over\
  \ there may be made of more than straw! It may contain wires and a radio transmitter\
  \ in its noggin.\u201D\n\u201CSorry, Chambers, you are right of course,\u201D said\
  \ Hiss.\nThe pair stalked across the wooden mud, which Whittaker Chambers had laid\
  \ to surround his pumpkin patch for security reasons. As they walked, arm in arm,\
  \ Chambers explained to Hiss how one of the pumpkins had been hollowed out so that\
  \ top secret microfilm could be hidden inside it.\n\u201CAre you not worried,\u201D\
  \ asked Hiss, \u201CThat the microfilm might be rendered useless on account of chance\
  \ gnawing by small scavenging animals such as squirrels or field mice or raccoons\
  \ or indeed certain swooping birds of the air, Chambers?\u201D\n\u201CWell, Hiss,\u201D\
  \ said Chambers, \u201CI have quite enough to fret about with the lamentable state\
  \ of my rotten teeth and my stained and shabby suit, not to mention my many illicit\
  \ homosexual encounters up and down the eastern seaboard. I trust in Stalin to protect\
  \ my top secret microfilm from the predations of squirrels etcetera.\u201D\nAlger\
  \ Hiss wondered exactly how Stalin, far, far away in the Kremlin, could protect\
  \ a Maryland pumpkin patch, but he said nothing. After all, who was he to question\
  \ the omnipotent wisdom and ideological genius of the pockmarked Party leader? The\
  \ two alleged chums arrived at the pumpkin patch.\n\u201CNow, see if you can spot\
  \ the hollowed-out pumpkin, Hiss,\u201D said Chambers.\n\u201CB-but they all look\
  \ almost identical, Chambers,\u201D said Hiss.\n\u201CThat, Hiss, is the beauty\
  \ of my scheme,\u201D replied Chambers.\nA few yards from where they stood, a Federal\
  \ agency radio transmitter hidden in the head of a scarecrow sputtered and buzzed.\
  \ Far away, in Langley, Virginia, an operative snapped to attention and clamped\
  \ his headphones tighter against his ears. Pencil poised, he was ready to transcribe\
  \ what he heard\u2026 but he heard only the sound of gnawing, as a squirrel, or\
  \ possibly a field mouse or a raccoon or a certain swooping bird of the air dug\
  \ its fangs or beak into the wiring.\nIn Maryland, Whittaker Chambers and Alger\
  \ Hiss stood in the morning mist, in the pumpkin patch, pointing at pumpkins and\
  \ plotting the overthrow of the capitalist system.\n[2010-03-30]"
