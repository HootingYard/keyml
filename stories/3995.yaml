text: "\u201CWhen Violet and Denys finally get married, after Vita decides just before\
  \ the wedding not to go through with the plan for the two women to elope (she had\
  \ heard from Harold, and \u2018something snapped in my mind\u2019), the honeymooners\
  \ and Vita all find themselves in Paris together, and Vita takes Violet away from\
  \ Denys (\u2018I wanted to say \u201CDon't you know, you stupid fool, she is mine\
  \ in every sense of the word?\u201D), then Denys takes her back from Vita (\u2018\
  That night I dined at the Ritz, and from the open window of her room Violet watched\
  \ me, and Denys sobbed in the room behind her\u2019, and the general conclusion\
  \ is that \u2018That day seems to have made a great impression upon him\u2019\u2014\
  well, I suppose it would) after which \u2018they went away to St Jean de Luz, and\
  \ I went to Switzerland with Harold\u2019, and then they all go back to England,\
  \ but soon the girls are off again, to Paris (\u2018I used to sit in caf\xE9s drinking\
  \ coffee, and watching people go by\u2019\u2014fancy!) and Monte Carlo (\u2018divine\u2019\
  ), where \u2018a complication arose over Denys announcing his arrival at Cannes\u2019\
  \ (by now his blue eyes must have been damned near falling out of his head, never\
  \ mind starting), and they all form twos again and go back to London, but then Violet\
  \ goes off to Amiens, where Vita is to join her, for ever this time, only when Vita\
  \ follows she takes Denys along, which complicates the situation until Denys says\
  \ he will leave them and never come back (\u2018Denys cried the whole way\u2019\
  ), but he does come back, this time travelling with Harold and only a couple of\
  \ lengths behind Violet's father, and then Harold actually suggests that Violet\
  \ may have slept with her own husband (\u2018I thought I should have gone mad when\
  \ she said that\u2019) so Vita makes a scene and goes off with Harold from Amiens\
  \ to Paris, and Violet's father catches the same train, but no sooner do they get\
  \ to Paris than Violet turns up (maybe she was at the other end of the train), and\
  \ the two girls go up to Harold's and Vita's room, whereupon Harold bursts in with\
  \ Denys (how many people were on that train, for God's sake?), and Denys swears\
  \ that he has never done anything unbecoming with his own wife (\u2018I promise\
  \ you there has never been anything of that kind between Violet and me\u2019), which\
  \ mollifies Vita a little, \u2018but still it was bad enough that she should have\
  \ deceived me even to a certain extent\u2019, and then it all gets rather confused,\
  \ except that at one point Vita goes to Paris, Violet goes to Bordighera and Denys\
  \ goes to Cornwall (no mention of Harold\u2014perhaps he's just gone to bed), and\
  \ among other places visited by the various parties are Avignon, San Remo and Venice\u2014\
  oh, now I remember where Harold was\u2014he says he has been \u2018spending his\
  \ time with rather low people, the demi-monde\u2019, and he sums up by saying \u2018\
  my heart feels like a p\xEAche melba\u2019, and then Violet fades away and Harold\
  \ and Vita live happily ever after, apart from Vita's having an affair with Virginia\
  \ Woolf, and another one, just to vary things, with Geoffrey Scott, while Harold\u2026\
  \n\u201CThe long and the short of the matter is that practically everybody in this\
  \ ludicrous story has a nice comfortable income, apart from the charwoman whom Vita\
  \ steps across when visiting Violet early one morning, and of whom she says \u2018\
  There was a dreary slut scrubbing the doorstep\u2019. When you have plenty of money\
  \ you can not only afford to rush about between London and Amiens and Paris (where\
  \ you stay at the Ritz, of course\u2014well, I mean, doesn't everybody?) and San\
  \ Remo and Bordighera and Monte Carlo and Avignon and Venice; you can also afford\
  \ (if you are silly enough to want to) to spend your time striking grotesque poses,\
  \ keening over your own emotions, and saying things like \u2018I had been vouchsafed\
  \ insight, as one sometimes is\u2019. The \u2018dreary slut\u2019 scrubbing the\
  \ doorstep could no more afford the poses than she could afford the travel, and\
  \ I would dearly like to read her diary, particularly if it contained a passage\
  \ about some stupid, snobbish, affected woman who stepped right on to her nice clean\
  \ doorstep the minute after she had just whitewashed the bleedin\u2019 thing.\u201D\
  \nBernard Levin, reviewing Portrait Of A Marriage by Nigel Nicolson in The Observer,\
  \ 28 October 1973, collected in Taking Sides (1979).\nADDENDUM\_: Elsewhere in the\
  \ collection, Levin writes thus of Yoko Ono's husband (in 1974): \u201CThere is\
  \ nothing wrong with Mr Lennon that could not be cured by standing him upside down\
  \ and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out.\u201D\n[2010-02-26]"
