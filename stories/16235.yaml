text: "Two boys were sitting on the harbour wall playing with dice. One of the boys\
  \ was clever, and the other boy was dim. Now, when I tell you that one of the boys\
  \ tossed the dice into the sea that sloshed against the harbour wall, you are likely\
  \ to conclude that the boy who so tossed was the dim one. Dice serve no purpose\
  \ in the sea. They will bob upon the surface of the waters, uselessly, carried by\
  \ the tides, growing ever more distant the one from the other, sopping wet, and\
  \ no longer to be played with.\nBut in fact it was the clever boy who ruined their\
  \ play by tossing the dice into the sea. For not only was he astoundingly clever,\
  \ with an intellect far outwith the usual range of boyish brains, but he was also\
  \ a psychopath. No sooner had he tossed the dice into the sea than he shoved his\
  \ dim playmate off the harbour wall into the same sloshing sea and, for good measure,\
  \ he grabbed hold of a passing harbour kitten and, deaf to its mewling, chucked\
  \ it into the water alongside the dice and the dim boy. The name of this clever\
  \ boy? Young Babinsky!\nAmused by his seaside enormities, the youthful psychopath\
  \ toddled off to a milk bar with not a care in the world. Meanwhile, in the vast\
  \ wet merciless sea, the dice bobbed, but the dim boy and the harbour kitten sank\
  \ like stones, and the waters washed over them, and they were forgotten.\n\nLet\
  \ us leap forward thirty, no, forty years. Forty is a better number than thirty,\
  \ according to Bl\xF6tzmann, who famously assigned abstruse yet compelling non-numerical\
  \ values to certain numbers that took his fancy, for example eight and eleven and\
  \ fifteen and sixteen and nineteen and twenty-six and twenty-nine and thirty-seven\
  \ and forty and oh for god's sake shut up with the list of numbers, it could go\
  \ on ad infinitum. Suffice to say forty is one of Bl\xF6tzmann's so-called \u201C\
  basilisk\u201D numbers, whatever that might mean.\nIn the forty years since the\
  \ clever boy and the dim boy sat on the harbour wall playing with dice, the wall\
  \ has crumbled. The big wet sea is reclaiming the land. Half of the town is now\
  \ under water, including the milk bar where, all those years ago, Babinsky drank\
  \ a tumbler of warm sour goaty milk and chuckled at his youthful crimes. And now\
  \ he has returned. Look, there he is, silhouetted against the ghastly sky, swinging\
  \ his axe, standing on the town's highest hill and gazing, perplexed, at the sea\
  \ below. He has come on a pilgrimage of sorts, eager to revisit the scenes\u2014\
  idyllic, as he remembers them\u2014of his youth. But they are gone, sunk beneath\
  \ the waves as surely as his first victims, his dim playmate and the harbour kitten,\
  \ vanished forever.\n\nBabinsky was not a man to let a little thing like the sea\
  \ confound him. Pausing only to waylay a passing Punch & Judy man, butchering him\
  \ with his axe and slicers, the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopath lumbered\
  \ off towards a chandlery, where he rented a deep-sea diving outfit, complete with\
  \ gleaming brass helmet. Then he walked into the sea, following the old familiar\
  \ roads and paths and mews and alleys submerged under the churning waters, until\
  \ he came to the milk bar.\nIts door had long ago fallen from its rusted hinges.\
  \ Babinsky entered, and sat at the communal table, whereon tiny crabs scuttled and\
  \ lobsters clacked. Memories tumbled through his insane head. He could almost taste\
  \ the goaty milk of forty years ago.\nAnd then, from behind the milk bar counter,\
  \ there appeared a sea-wraith, festooned in seaweed. It was accompanied by a sea-ghoul\
  \ kitten. The kitten wore a necklace of eelgrass, on which were strung a pair of\
  \ dice. The wraith sat down opposite Babinsky. The ghoulish kitten jumped up on\
  \ to the table and chased away the crabs and lobsters.\n\u201CHello, Babinsky\u201D\
  \ gurgled the wraith.\nFor once, the walrus-moustached psychopath was nonplussed.\n\
  \u201CYes, it is me, your childhood playmate, poor dim Gracchus. You shoved me off\
  \ the old harbour wall, into the pitiless sea, and chucked Tiddles the kitten in\
  \ after me. I thank you for that. He has been a boon, if kittenish, companion these\
  \ past forty years.\n\u201CWe both drowned, of course. But our bodies were never\
  \ recovered. When we sank to the bottom of the sea, we were dragged into a cave\
  \ by an old man with a long beard who carried a trident. He nursed us back to what\
  \ passes for health among sea-wraiths and sea-ghouls, until we were well enough\
  \ to attend his series of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations about undersea life.\
  \ They were a real eye-opener, I can tell you. Even someone as dim as me, or as\
  \ stupid as the kitten\u2014we learned so much!\n\u201CFor example, do you have\
  \ any idea how easy it is to hunt down and kill tiny fish such as dabs and sprats\
  \ and blennies? That is how I make my living\u2014or rather, wraithing\u2014these\
  \ days. I roam the seas in my little ship,\_ with Tiddles as First Mate, casting\
  \ my net and catching tiny fish which I sell to the other denizens of the deep.\
  \ There are all sorts down here\u2014drowned sailors, suicides, nitwits who never\
  \ learned to swim.\n\u201CYou should think about coming to join us, Babinsky. There\
  \ must have been times, lying awake in your blood-drenched bed, when it crossed\
  \ your mind that you should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the\
  \ floors of silent seas. Not that it's silent down here, oh no. Apart from the shrill\
  \ piping screams of slaughtered dabs and sprats and blennies, there is the continuing\
  \ reverberation of \u201CAutumn\u201D, played by the house band on the Titanic,\
  \ as documented by Gavin Bryars in his 1975 recording The Sinking Of The Titanic,\
  \ released on Brian Eno's Obscure Records label. Plus there are all sorts of weird\
  \ bubbly gurgling noises.\n\u201CAnyway, Babinsky my old mucker, give it some thought.\
  \ I think you'll like it here. My ship has no rudder, and it is driven by the wind\
  \ that blows in the undermost regions of death.\u201D\nThe first sentence, and the\
  \ last, were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between\
  \ was not.\n[2018-02-13]"
