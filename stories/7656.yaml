text: "I thought it prudent, when making preparations for last Friday's Evening Of\
  \ Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose, to provide the audience with a list of instructions,\
  \ to ensure they conducted themselves properly. After all, one does not want to\
  \ have to interrupt one's babbling to have to deal with fits of the vapours, noisy\
  \ potato crisp munching, or other distractions. The printed programme for the evening\
  \ thus included this list, which may be of use to other performers:\nINSTRUCTIONS\
  \ FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE\nI. Please remain seated during the more exciting\
  \ moments.\nII. If for any reason you need to mop your brow, use a dainty napkin.\n\
  III. Spillages must be paid for in coinage of the realm.\nIV. When the Darning-Needle\
  \ of Destiny is unveiled, cower.\nV. Unseemly pangs may be tempered by moral balance.\n\
  VI. Applause should be rendered with unbridled fanaticism.\nVII. Drink ye every\
  \ one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away (Isaiah, 36\_\
  : 16,17)\n[2011-11-21]"
