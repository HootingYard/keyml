  Children, if you have read this far, take heed. Lars Talc could not have known that
  he carried in his pocket, embedded in his prize horn, a lightning conductor of superb
  efficiency. But you will be on your guard.

  You will not forget to ask papa to place an egg laid on Ascension Day, and a houseleek
  plant, in the rafters of your dwelling.

  You will not fret and dally at the onset of a thunderstorm, neglecting to throw
  open all the doors and windows, to turn pictures to face the wall, and to cover
  your mirrors with heavy blankets.

  You will not forget to wear a wreath of laurel, and a necklace of coral.

  You will never put your shiny new boots upon the table.

  You will not attempt to count the twinkling stars, nor point with your finger towards
  that part of the heavens whence lightning is expected.

  You will not forget to gather bundles of hazel and willow twigs and stand them in
  pots of water.

  If you pick a poppy, you will not let a petal fall from it on to your hand.

  When mama tells you to gather up the knives and forks and spoons and scissors and
  scythes and tweezers and pincers and pins and needles and all other implements of
  steel, and put them away in the cupboard, you will not disobey her.

  You will not hang back when your pals go scampering to the churches to set tolling
  great clamours of bells.

  You will not stand near towering pines, nor up to your ankles in a basin of water,
  nor by any leaden spout, iron gate, railings, bandstand, palisade, or spigot in
  times of lightning.

  Will you?

  THE END
