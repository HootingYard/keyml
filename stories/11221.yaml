text: "I am afraid the Key head is an entirely empty thing at the moment. So here,\
  \ to keep you entertained, is a piece that appeared nine years ago today, on 3 April\
  \ 2004, though it was written\u2014and published as a pamphlet\u2014long long ago\
  \ in the last decade of the previous century. It is entitled Sidney The Bat Is Awarded\
  \ The Order Of Lenin.\nLike many bats, Sidney spent much of his time hanging upside\
  \ down in a dark, damp cave. Both of his parents were still alive, and on Saturdays\
  \ he would visit them. They lived in the attic of a museum, and enjoyed swooping,\
  \ wings aflutter, around the heads of any museum employees who came up to the attic,\
  \ which was used as a clutter-strewn storage area. The museum housed collections\
  \ of electromagnetic apparatus, galvanometers, and cast iron mesmeric engines. It\
  \ was the most renowned museum of its kind in the land, numbering among its exhibits\
  \ not only Von Ick's Patent Trance Mechanism but also an archive of papers from\
  \ the laboratory of the great celery scientist Kapisko.\n\nFigure 1\_: One of the\
  \ museum exhibits\nProfessor Maud Dweb was the chief curator. Her in-tray was piled\
  \ high with complaints about the bats in the attic. One young assistant janitor,\
  \ on his first ever visit up there, had been literally frightened out of his wits.\
  \ He had been removed to a sanatorium in remote mountainous country, and his family,\
  \ despite most of them being brain-addled, had made known their intentions to prosecute\
  \ the museum. One of the land's most relentless lawyers had been paid a retainer.\
  \ Professor Dweb decided to act.\nOne Saturday evening, after the museum had closed,\
  \ when soon the full moon [would] swim up over the edge of the world and hang like\
  \ a great golden cheese (in the words attributed to the shade of Oscar Wilde by\
  \ the spirit medium Hester Travers Smith), the curator ascended the staircase to\
  \ the gloomy attic. It was the work of minutes to set a number of bat-traps in the\
  \ darkness. As she made to leave, Professor Dweb stumbled over a crate containing\
  \ the world's only surviving example of Bickering's Superb New Hinge, banged her\
  \ head on the wall, and dropped to the floor, unconscious. Sidney's parents swooped\
  \ low, and perched\u2014do bats perch?\u2014on her back.\n\nFigure 2\_: Diagram\
  \ of the attic\nAt that very moment, Sidney flapped in through the skylight. He\
  \ and his parents exchanged greetings, in bat-language. They told him what had happened\
  \ to Professor Dweb, who was sinking into a catatonic stupor. Sidney was most disappointed,\
  \ for he could not see any fun in flapping around someone who was unconscious. She\
  \ wouldn't be scared at all! He resolved to arouse the curator, and at once began\
  \ to make hideous bat-like squealing noises directly into her ear, flicking his\
  \ wings against her temples. It took some time, but eventually Maud Dweb woke with\
  \ a start. Then she screeched, flailing her arms at the mischievous bat. She fled\
  \ the attic, slamming the trap-door behind her, leaving the fiendish bat-traps to\
  \ do their work.\nAn hour later she was back in the attic, armed with a torch. She\
  \ found Sidney hanging upside down from the rafters. \u201CWell, young bat,\u201D\
  \ she announced, \u201CInadvertently, you have performed a great service to your\
  \ country! Had you not woken me from my stupor, thieves would have made off with\
  \ the museum's most prized exhibit! I was only just in time to nab them! Fleeing\
  \ from you, I went downstairs to find a pair of counter-revolutionary ne'er-do-wells\
  \ about to make off with Darjeeling's Anti-Imperialist Galvanising Motor! You are\u2014\
  as a mere bat\u2014probably unaware that this machine is a potent symbol of our\
  \ glorious revolution. I shall recommend to the General Secretary of the Party that\
  \ you are given an award in recognition of your deed. Well done!\u201D\n\nFigure\

  \ on his bat-head. Professor Dweb dismantled the bat-traps. The full moon shimmered\
  \ through the skylight.\n[2013-04-03]"
