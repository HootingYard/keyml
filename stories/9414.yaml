text: "Let us imagine you are sitting at home, in an armchair, with your feet up,\
  \ listening to Scriabin on the radio perhaps, or reading Martin Amis's very sensible\
  \ new novel Lionel Asbo\_: State Of England, or simply gazing vacantly into space,\
  \ like a dimwit or a simpleton, though you need not actually be a dimwit or a simpleton,\
  \ merely dozing, half-asleep, at the border of the Land of Nod. Then imagine that\
  \ your poppet rushes into the room, from the front garden, crying \u201CDennis!\
  \ Dennis! Come and see!\u201D\nWhatever you have been doing, or not doing, you sit\
  \ bolt upright and ask \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\n\u201CCome and see the shoveller!\u201D\
  \ cries your poppet.\nIt is important to note, and indeed it is the very crux of\
  \ my argument, that, while still sat in your armchair, before following your poppet\
  \ out to the front garden, you do not know what she is talking about. Note, too,\
  \ that I did not write, you have no idea what she is talking about. There is a difference,\
  \ and a critical one. It is not the case that, at this stage, you have no idea.\
  \ On the contrary, you have a very good idea. You know that, once you are in the\
  \ front garden, in response to your poppet's urgent beckoning, you will see one\
  \ of two things. But because you do not know which, it is fair to say that you do\
  \ not know what she is talking about. Thus may we calibrate the efficacy of human\
  \ communication through words.\nLet us leave you in your armchair for a moment,\
  \ and examine what you know. You know that, from the vantage point of your front\
  \ garden, a shoveller can be seen. But what kind of shoveller? There are, as I have\
  \ indicated, two types. The shoveller may be a person with a shovel, or it may be\
  \ a duck. Before hoisting yourself out of the armchair and making your slow, creaking,\
  \ exhausted way into the front garden, you might want to ascertain the type of shoveller\
  \ your poppet is eager for you to see. You can ask, \u201CIs it a person with a\
  \ shovel or a duck?\u201D But it may be that your poppet has already rushed back\
  \ out, and is out of earshot, in which case you might make an educated guess.\n\
  For example, which type of shoveller is likely to spark your poppet's excitement,\
  \ and spark it sufficiently that she wishes to share it with you? If you, or she,\
  \ or both, are fanatical ornithologists, it is a near certainty that she is talking\
  \ about a duck. But what if ornithology plays no important part in either of your\
  \ lives? Astonishingly, such people do exist! In that case, guesswork will avail\
  \ you little. Conversely, your home might be slap bang next to important roadworks\
  \ on the Blister Lane Bypass, the racket of which has been causing you grief while\
  \ listening to Scriabin or reading Martin Amis or dropping off to sleep. In that\
  \ case, in all likelihood your poppet has seen a person with a shovel. But why would\
  \ that spark her excitement, so much so that she rushes in, to tell you about it,\
  \ and rushes out again, to see? Even if we grant the possibility that you, or she,\
  \ or both, are fanatical civil engineers, there will be shovellers\u2014that is,\
  \ persons with shovels\u2014aplenty to be seen for the duration of the roadworks\
  \ which, being important, will be a period of weeks or even months. On balance,\
  \ and irrespective of your fanaticism or lack of it in the field of civil engineering,\
  \ you might decide that the duck is the more probable shoveller, based on the information\
  \ thus far available. Even if neither you nor your poppet are fanatical ornithologists,\
  \ she may have been struck by a sense of wonder, out of the blue, as sometimes people\
  \ are, at sight of a bird. There is literature on such epiphanies.\nWith you still\
  \ in your armchair, we have been able to weigh the likelihood of the type of shoveller\
  \ your poppet wants you to see. We cannot say for certain it is a duck, but the\
  \ chances are that it is. Narrowing it further, to a Red shoveller, Cape shoveller,\
  \ Australasian shoveller, or Northern shoveller, will have to wait until you make\
  \ it to the front garden and see for yourself, unless, impatient, your poppet rushes\
  \ back in to implore you to hurry, in which case you can ask: \u201COf the four\
  \ types of dabbling ducks with long broad spatula-shaped beaks known as shovellers,\
  \ which is it?\u201D Beware, however, that you will only get a sensible answer to\
  \ this question if (a) your poppet is a fanatical ornithologist, and (b) if the\
  \ shoveller she has seen is indeed a duck, and not a person with a shovel.\nFor\
  \ let us not forget that the type of shoveller is not yet settled beyond all doubt.\
  \ By deciding, on the balance of probabilities, that your poppet is talking about\
  \ a duck does not mean we can airily dismiss the possibility\u2014and it is no more\
  \ than that\u2014that she is talking about a person with a shovel. We can briefly\
  \ examine the circumstances which make that actually more likely than the duck.\n\
  What if?, we ask, and it is often the prefix to a question which can yield significant\
  \ if unexpected results, what if the shoveller your poppet spotted was a person\
  \ with a shovel who was not engaged in important roadworks on the Blister Lane Bypass,\
  \ but was a gravedigger? The sight of a person with a shovel digging a grave just\
  \ outwith your front garden would be cause for surprise, and alarm, would it not?\
  \ It could be considered a portent, even a supernatural vision. Key to deciding\
  \ if this could be the cause of your poppet's excited rushing in would be her tone\
  \ of voice and her countenance. Innocent excitement, as occasioned by a bird epiphany,\
  \ can easily be confused with fright, or terror. It may be that your poppet is on\
  \ the verge of hysteria and nervous collapse, having seen a sinister figure digging\
  \ a grave just outside your front garden, a grave thus intended, as in a vision,\
  \ for you, or your poppet, or both. We might argue that she would have said \u201C\
  gravedigger\u201D, not \u201Cshoveller\u201D, but it is worth remembering that when\
  \ on the verge of hysteria or nervous collapse language can become skewed or fractured\
  \ or otherwise dislodged from the norm.\nTo know, beyond all doubt, what your poppet\
  \ is talking about, language itself is not enough. You are going to have to hoist\
  \ yourself out of your armchair and see for yourself. That is the basis of all science.\n\
