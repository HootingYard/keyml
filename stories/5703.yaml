  \ Hooting Yard:\nTo Knit Knots, Peradventure\nThis story, To knit knots, peradventure,\
  \ is probably aimed to be a funny piece of writing, and if read aloud, a tongue\
  \ twister. The story is though, rather repetitive and after reading the first two\
  \ paragraphs it starts to become all about the same thing; knitting a knot without\
  \ being caught/seen by a hurrying brute. This piece is repetitive but is in no way\
  \ boring; the many ways to knit a knot and not get caught by a hurrying brute is\
  \ probably mostly but not completely nonsense, such as \u201CThus the knitter of\
  \ knots is advised, in many books of the past, to find a secluded haven in which\
  \ to knit\u201D. Honestly if I were the knot knitter, I would have given up after\
  \ the numerous attempts of knitting a knot without getting caught by a hurrying\
  \ brute. The narrator doesn't seem to describe each character much, though in a\
  \ way it doesn't really matter to the piece at hand. From what is given we cannot\
  \ make out who (or possibly what) the knot knitter is, only that he/she is knitting\
  \ a knot of value, or I doubt a brute would trying to get his/her/its hands on it.\n\
  This is a very descriptive piece including many words that may not be understood\
  \ by children; words such as deftness, paragons and obviating. I think that this\
  \ story was based on a ridiculous idea, and that would never happen, even though\
  \ the actual writing is a creative piece and funny to read.\nThe main character\
  \ is either the knitter of the knot or the hurrying brute, the knot knitter in this\
  \ story is advised to do many a thing before he starts to knit a knot. The hurrying\
  \ brute is the reason for the many reasons why you need to find a secluded haven\
  \ such as a cave, behind ramparts or a towering fortress. The way the author talks\
  \ is in some way appropriate for the story, as the knot knitter is trying to get\
  \ away from the hurrying brute to find a place to knit. Although in the real world\
  \ I doubt a hurrying brute would try to stop you from knitting a knot in the first\
  \ place, and I wonder if there even such thing as a hurrying brute. Even though\
  \ the knot knitter is hurrying through what seems to be a forest (full of hurrying\
  \ brutes), he seems remarkably calm even if a brute is chasing him.\nThe books of\
  \ the past (read before being chased by a hurrying brute) refer to the somewhat\
  \ troublesome task of knitting a knot of peculiar knitting styles. Therefore the\
  \ safe house in which you confine must be particularly safe and secure so as you\
  \ may not be bothered with the hurrying brute. The only real problem when knitting\
  \ a simple knot is when the brutes come in swarms, then the knot knitter is advised\
  \ to abandon the knitting of his knot and run, even if the knot you are knitting\
  \ is of particular value. If being chased by a swarm of hurrying brutes then the\
  \ knot (if particularly prepared in their work) to have a missile at hand so to\
  \ distract knitter is advised the hurrying brute, and so is able to find another\
  \ rampart or clump of brambles to continue their knot knitting.\nTo Knit Knots,\
  \ Peradventure\nThe tone of this piece is rather unusual and bizarre, and not something\
  \ that you'd normally be reading in a story. It has some rather odd language, for\
  \ example \u2018It remains the case that the knitted knots has its own special place\
  \ in our hearts, whether our hearts flutter like a bird's or a squirrel's heart,\
  \ or pound like a drum\u2019. I don't understand the point of including information\
  \ on a squirrel's heart, as nobody knows (or even thinks about) why or how a squirrel's\
  \ heart beats. It goes off of the point a lot of the time (and some of the time\
  \ I don't know what the point is anyway!). Knot knitters do not exist so there is\
  \ no point. I think this is just a comedy piece of writing and is written just for\
  \ the laughter of others.\nThere aren't any main characters; the story just generally\
  \ talks about knot knitters and Brutes hurrying by and saying that hurrying brutes\
  \ can never have the time and patience of a knot knitter. Brutes don't exist in\
  \ our world which is why this story is more a comedy sketch than fact and fiction.\n\
  Imitation\nPeople don't understand the experience and challenging expertise needed\
  \ to become a knot knitter, but all of those people are hurrying brutes ignoring\
  \ the precision used by the knot knitters needing peace and quiet to knit their\
  \ knots in a very secluded environment. A plethora of noise is made by the hurrying\
  \ brute which agitates the civic knot knitters that try to accumulate on the knot\
  \ they are knitting.\nThat Awful Mess At Sludge Hall Farm\nI feel that the story\
  \ of \u201CThat Awful Mess at Sludge Hall Farm\u201D is an odd and imaginative creation.\
  \ For example \u201CNo-one knows the name of the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm. He\
  \ is a hermit and a mystic and a pole-vaulting champion.\u201D And as well as this,\
  \ the story is peculiar and a bit out-of-the-box in the way that it mentions things\
  \ that nobody would normally think of or about. For example \u201Cthe farmer still\
  \ pole-vaults every day, morning and evening, under the leaden sky at Sludge Hall\
  \ Farm. He is puffing from a pole-vault as the Italian detectives push open the\
  \ gate and greet him.\u201D\nI think this story is weird because it often strays\
  \ from the point as this example shows, \u201COne does not meet with a trio of stylishly\
  \ dressed Italian police investigators tramping up the path to Sludge Hall Farm.\
  \ In their Giuseppe Fonseca suits and Boffo Splendido shoes.\u201D It has a bit\
  \ of a magical feel as if things were very peculiar at Sludge Hall Farm as the farmer\
  \ is a \u201Cmystic, a hermit and a pole-vaulting champion\u201D and the story sometimes\
  \ talks about the farm as if it is magical. For example, \u201COne wonders what\
  \ will happen. Will the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm speak for the first time in twenty\
  \ years? Will he use his mystic powers to crack asunder the close-knit and almost\
  \ telepathic team spirit of the detective trio, until they are snarling at each\
  \ other like mad dogs and fighting with pitchforks?\u201D and \u201CWill the farmer\
  \ placate his mutant pig and place it in a trance? Why is the hay in the hayloft\
  \ not like normal hay? Is it hay from another dimension, or from somewhere else\
  \ in the space-time continuum?\u201D I think this is funny because most stories\
  \ now include things from dungeons or mars like the monster from mars but this story\
  \ uses a hayloft and the hay inside it with a mutant pig as the monsters.\nI also\
  \ think that the feel of the story is a sort of satire of what things are and what\
  \ some things are becoming. Maybe for instance the hay in the hayloft could be a\
  \ satire on what farming is turning into, the use of chemicals to create food that\
  \ is now very different and much fuller of chemicals than it was 100 years ago.\
  \ And the mutant pig that has snapped its chain could be a satire on guard dogs\
  \ and the fact that they are getting more and more aggressive as their owners are\
  \ getting more and more inhumane.\nHoofprint Advice\nThe feel of this piece of writing\
  \ is amusing and strange, \u2018If on the other hand, the hoofprints are still there,\
  \ clamber on to a step ladder and try to obliterate them with a rag and a proprietary\
  \ cleansing spray such as Hoofbegone!\u2019. This part of the guide starts off and\
  \ if sounds normal and then you get to the spray what is called \u2018Hoofbegone\u2019\
  \ and you think that it's a tad strange because the name of the cleaning product\
  \ is a bit odd because you have never thought of a product called something like\
  \ that before.\nThe advice that the writing gives you is funny but serious, it is\
  \ funny because the things it is telling you to do are amusing such as, \u2018Try\
  \ to recall any dreams you may have had while you were asleep. Did any hooved beasts,\
  \ such as goats or horses, feature in these dreams?\u2019 but then at the same time\
  \ it is serious because if you do wake up with hoofprints on your ceiling, it's\
  \ a serious matter and you would follow this guide. When you start to read this\
  \ you start to think how weird it is, and you think it is sarcastic because you\
  \ don't normally think you are going to wake up and there are going to be hoofprints\
  \ on your ceiling, but then after you read the first paragraph you get hooked to\
  \ the guide and don't want it to stop.\nThere are no main characters as such in\
  \ this writing. It is a guide so the author is aiming it at the people who wake\
  \ up one morning and find hoofprints on their ceiling. It is written in first person\
  \ so the author is telling the story. Nowadays we get step-by-step guides, such\
  \ as \u2018how to get a wasp's nest out of your loft\u2019 or \u2018how to put a\
  \ washing line up\u2019. But if you saw this guide you would be amazed because you\
  \ wouldn't think you would see hoofprints on your ceiling, also if you saw this\
  \ guide you wouldn't believe that it would actually happen, many thoughts about\
  \ the matter would be going through your head and it would be a serious matter.\
  \ Also if you did have hoofprints on your ceiling you wouldn't expect to go out\
  \ to the supermarket or some sort of shop and expect to find a guide of what to\
  \ do in that situation.\nExtension\nIf you do wake up and there are hoofprints on\
  \ your ceiling and you have already been and seen the local nocturnal hoofprint\
  \ investigation specialist, ask the woman at the reception of the office for \u2018\
  The Potion\u2019 and make sure you do anything to get that unique potion this special\
  \ drink form of a potion will make you turn upside down, when you have got the drink\
  \ go back to your room and gulp the drink down and then take a quick stroll across\
  \ the ceiling and follow the hoofprints until you find out who or what has done\
  \ this. If the trail goes on and on and you potion has run out, go back to the local\
  \ hoofprint investigation office and tell the same woman at the desk that the potion\
  \ wore off and that first, you would like a refund and second that you need the\
  \ papers to sue the specialist, if the woman refuses to give you the papers just\
  \ ask for a emergency appointment with the local nocturnal hoofprint investigation\
  \ specialist again.\nThe Muscular Fool And The Other Fool\nThe story comes across\
  \ as being quite a funny story as it is about a \u2018fool\u2019. It starts off\
  \ with the line \u2018a fool dug a hole in the ground with a spade\u2019; I think\
  \ this a strange beginning but it does make you want to read on.\nThe person in\
  \ this story immediately comes across as being quite stupid as the first thing he\
  \ does is dig a hole and sit in it. The author of this book is clearly quite strange\
  \ like the character. The character throughout does many strange things such as\
  \ above dig a hole just to sit in and then go in an escalator just going up and\
  \ down all day being fascinated by them.\nI spent 20 minutes on this piece of work.\n\
  Confessions Of A Door To Door Monkey Salesman\nThis story is a \u2018Bildungsroman\
  \ of fierce intensity\u2019, as it says at the beginning, because it follows the\
  \ development and maturing of the lead character. I found this story very odd because\
  \ it was about an orphan, adopted by some pig farmers, who was taken under the wing\
  \ of a \u2018countryside rascal\u2019 to become a door to door monkey salesman after\
  \ his adoptive parents perished in the \u2018Munich air disaster\u2019. As you can\
  \ see here the plot is extremely bizarre and the world in which the story is written\
  \ is mostly the same as ours but with small differences, for example: door to door\
  \ monkey salesmen and \u2018rascals\u2019 which the main character searches for.\n\
  This story in also written in an interesting way, which is: one paragraph is written\
  \ in the main characters point of view and then the next is written in the narrator's\
  \ point of view, reviewing what is happening in the story. The story takes a strange\
  \ idea and imbeds it into our world, making the concept of a door to door monkey\
  \ salesman not as strange an idea as first thought.\nThe story is written in first\
  \ person; however, the writer describes you remembering yourself as a young child\
  \ being very strange and irregular, \u2018with your two thumbs, seven fingers and\
  \ eleven toes\u2019. Two thumbs in human terms is clearly very regular but the mother,\
  \ whom is speaking to you at this point, goes on to talk about your \u2018irregularity\u2019\
  \ and says, \u2018and you, my cherished tiny one, are one freakish anomaly,\u2019\
  \nAnother character is the \u2018monkey rascal\u2019, who is an old and is a man.\
  \ It describes him as old when he says \u2018and theses old bones of mine aren't\
  \ getting any younger.\u2019 You can tell that the person is a man when the main\
  \ character says \u2018pausing now and then to sip his cocoa,\u2019\nImitation:\n\
  I found myself one day walking down the cobbled street toward the house in which\
  \ the man asking for monkey rental lives. It was an intriguing house made from the\
  \ bricks of the dilapidated old habitation which once stood before it. The monkeys\
  \ strolled behind me in tow not making a sound as they edged closer to the eerie\
  \ setting. I must have looked very off-putting with my severe disfigurement and\
  \ primates following along after me and so the townsfolk veered away from me as\
  \ I ambled down the road. The man did not seem to be a rascal when I encountered\
  \ him at his doorstep and confronted me with several monkeys behind him himself,\
  \ he then said,\n\u2018You are the monkey salesman.\u2019 With that I replied I\
  \ was and handed over the monkey to him. However, he rejected the monkey and told\
  \ me to wait for him to retrieve something from his dwelling before accepting the\
  \ animal \u2026\nThis paragraph would be slotted into the story after he has been\
  \ introduced to the monkey rascal and is on his debut monkey sale.\nCharacter Flaw\
  \ Of Mediaeval Peasant\nI feel that the tone of this piece of writing is meant to\
  \ be comical. This is because of certain lines in it, for example, \u2018I am not\
  \ Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be. I don't even know who Prince Hamlet is, or\
  \ was, or will be, and I was always meant to be a peasant.\u2019 The reason I think\
  \ this line is comical, is because it is from TS Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred\
  \ Prufrock, which means the character has obviously heard this line from somewhere,\
  \ but doesn't really know what it means, and is just trying to sound clever. \u2018\
  \u2018'Twas writ upon the stars.\u2019 This line really does make the peasant sound\
  \ stupid because he can't speak properly and the line should say, 'Twas written\
  \ upon the stars, and yet again I don't think he knows what he is talking about.\
  \ There for I feel the peasant is trying to sound clever, when he is just making\
  \ himself sound stupid.\nThe character in the story is a mediaeval peasant called\
  \ Cleothgard, who is trying to explain his character flaw, across the centuries.\
  \ He tries to sound clever because he thinks people will think more of him but in\
  \ fact he just sounds stupid. In the story he explains that his character flaw is,\
  \ whenever a baron is approaching him he feels the need to out do all the people\
  \ around him, by showing his appreciation, he says \u2018A goodly number of them\
  \ will tug their forelocks and dribble with happiness at the sight of him, but I\
  \ feel this urge to outdo them. That is my character flaw.\u2019\nI think I am the\
  \ only person with my character flaw. It is strange to have this character flaw\
  \ but then everyone does have a character flaw. The thing is I try to outdo everyone\
  \ but I really just act so stupid no one notices me. Yet I want people to notice\
  \ me. I mean I don't mean to do what I do and I try to stop myself, but somehow\
  \ I just can't. I have this uncontrollable urge to, whenever a baron is coming,\
  \ to fall flat on face and bury my head in the mud.\nImpugned By A Peasant\nMy story\
  \ is very strange and quite light hearted; the main character gets obsessed with\
  \ a peasant who insulted him. I also think the story is about bullying because lots\
  \ of people insult him and he says \u2018I would have welcomed death\u2019.\nMy\
  \ paragraph\nI have been impugned, many times a day, by the peasant with the greasy,\
  \ matted hair. He calls me all the names under the sun. None of them are nice. I\
  \ have become accustom to this impugning every day, until my peasant went away.\
  \ I looked for him so I could impugn him, but he was gone, never to be seen again.\
  \ I asked where he had gone but no-one seemed to know, was he going fast, slow,\
  \ did he have greasy hair and horrid teeth. Was he dirty?\nWhen I arrived home I\
  \ started to build a peasant to impugn me; I started to build him from cardboard\
  \ and wire mesh, a mechanical peasant to impugn me daily. I can still imagine the\
  \ peasant, perfectly in my head, his greasy hair and horrid teeth.\nBungled Heists\n\
  The story sounds like it has been written for children in the way that the writer\
  \ has described what happened. He has written the first part of the story about\
  \ stealing bird seed, which isn't like drugs or electricals. He also writes that\
  \ he thumped the truck driver; instead he could have written that he stabbed him\
  \ or held a gun to his head. This gives it the feeling of more of a children's story\
  \ about a post office robbery than an adult crime thriller.\nThere are only three\
  \ people in the story who are named and only two of them appear more than once in\
  \ it. These three are Blodgett, Detective Captain Cargpan and Mrs Gubbins. Blodgett\
  \ is the main character in the story and it all revolves around him. He appears\
  \ to be quite a clumsy man but is very well-built. He is a man that gets involved\
  \ with heists and always manages to ruin it by not being observant, getting distracted\
  \ or just acting a fool. Detective Captain Cargpan is not described in this story\
  \ and only appears briefly in it, this is the same with Mrs Gubbins.\nSeventh Heist.\
  \ By now, Blodgett's next heist has been widely publicised because of the report\
  \ that the weekly heist intelligencer had in its last issue. The heist is supposed\
  \ to take place in a well-known seaside resort by a very dangerous gang who is thought\
  \ to have purchased a small amount of explosives. Because of this gang's history\
  \ of murder and manslaughter, the police have been called to surround the area.\n\
  Along The Banks Of The Smem\nI think the story is written in a serious way which\
  \ made it quite funny. The man in the story is telling us about all his illnesses\
  \ and accidents that he has had. I had to read this a few times to understand it\
  \ properly because it is full of complex sentences and unusual language for instance,\
  \ \u201Cthe mountain, disgorging a miscellaneous collection of people.\u201D The\
  \ author does not put a very nice picture in my mind when they are talking about\
  \ the Smem. The name \u2018Smem\u2019 makes it sound grotty and like an unpleasant\
  \ place to visit. This is a clever topic because everyone can relate to being ill\
  \ but it seems strange how he is always ill. It is quite long with lots of sudden\
  \ flash backs to make the story more clear.\nThe main character is a man who had\
  \ gone away to a place along the banks of the Smem a river. He seems to be reminiscing\
  \ and telling us all about his life during the story. You never find out his name\
  \ or much about him apart from storeys about his health. He is prone to hearting\
  \ himself and has a very bad relationship with goat's milk, he thinks it's not safe\
  \ and is very unhygienic. His illnesses are very unusual like when he says he had\
  \ \u201Cleasio in testiculo\u201D a type of disease in his testicles. This shows\
  \ us how hard his life must have been. He has a peg-leg and he talks a bit about\
  \ his religious hysteria which is quite intriguing.\nExtension\nWhen I was age eleven\
  \ I twisted my spine in a boating accident. This was a huge shock to the system\
  \ and took three months of physiotherapy to sort out. For two years I had a very\
  \ strained Adams apple and a cracked nose. In the summer of 2004 I hade the most\
  \ horrific illness that insisted on me waking up at 12 o'clock every night to be\
  \ violently sick at least 4 times. I was later in danger of my guttural speech going\
  \ and never returning. Now standing on the banks of the Smem I wonder if I was just\
  \ handed a bad card in life and if I was really destined for greatness.\n[2010-12-15]"
