  \ reading sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. The show is approaching its thirteenth\
  \ anniversary, in April, and I rather regret that it never occurred to me (nor to\
  \ anybody at Resonance) to give each episode a number. It would be pleasant to be\
  \ able to say \u201CThis is Hooting Yard On The Air, Episode 666\u201D, or whatever\
  \ number we have reached. I suppose there might be a frighteningly fanatical listener\
  \ out there somewhere who has kept such a tally\u2014if so, I hope they would get\
  \ in touch and enlighten us all.\n[2017-01-27]"
