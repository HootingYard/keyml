text: 'Any account of Aesop''s foibles is necessarily hampered by the fact that we
  know so very little about him. Indeed, it is not certain that he ever actually existed.
  Assuming, for the moment, that he did exist, and made up at least some of the stories
  attributed to him, we could advance the idea that it is a peculiar foible to bang
  on about animals having the powers of human speech and reason. It is the sort of
  conceit a writer might use once or twice, for a particular artistic purpose, but
  to keep returning to it again and again indicates a low-level mania we could describe
  as a foible. Then there is Plutarch''s story that Aesop was convicted of theft from
  a temple and subsequently thrown off a cliff. Charitably, we could say that petty
  larceny, such as stealing a bitty-bob from a place of worship, is better described
  as a foible than as the character flaw of the habitual criminal, as revealed by
  phrenology. But these are slim pickings, and until we are able to discover more
  about the historical Aesop, we have no basis upon which to impute further foibles
  to him.
