text: "Here is a piece of signage at the entrance to a school self-esteem \u2018n\u2019\
  \ diversity awareness hub in Bermondsey. (Click to enlarge.)\n\nYou will note that,\
  \ upper right, the academy is proud that \u201CStudents [are] able to show case\
  \ their talent in a professional setting\u201D. Walking past the sign fairly often,\
  \ I grew increasingly exasperated, and eventually fired off an email:\nIt is really\
  \ quite appalling, as Prince Charles might say, that your sign at the top of Dunton\
  \ Road is illiterate. \u201CShowcase\u201D is one word, not two. Having such an\
  \ elementary error on what I would suppose to be a \u201Cshowcase\u201D for your\
  \ academy is like those shopfronts that boast of a \u201Cproffesional\u201D service.\n\
  Are you going to correct it?\nI received the following reply:\nDear Mr Key,\nMany\
  \ thanks for taking the time to email the Academy regarding the mistake on our sign\
  \ at the top of Dunton Road.\nI will raise your concern with the company who design\
  \ and manufacture our signs so that it does not happen again.\nWith all good wishes,\n\
  Alan Dane\n    Vice Principal\nYou will not be surprised to learn that this only\
  \ served to increase my exasperation. I wrote back:\nIt's not really a case of it\
  \ being my concern, as if I had sent a complaint about an incident. It's a basic\
  \ error on a public sign on an educational institution. Did nobody at the Academy\
  \ raise \u201Ctheir concern\u201D when the sign was delivered?\nYou also seem to\
  \ be suggesting that it is the fault of some arm's-length supplier, though I suppose\
  \ that evasion of responsibility is all too common these days.\nMarvellous news\
  \ that \u201Cit will not happen again\u201D, but the question I asked was whether\
  \ you were going to correct the existing sign.\nMr Dane's response?\nDear Mr Key,\n\
  I have asked the design and manufacturing company to explain the cause of the error.\
  \ The matter will then be dealt with by the Academy internally.\nYours sincerely,\n\
  Alan Dane\nTempting as it was to stride into the school, locate Mr Dane's office,\
  \ and sluice out his brain with some kind of cleansing fluid, I contented myself\
  \ with the following riposte:\nDear Mr Dane\nWhat an extraordinary reply. Do you\
  \ ever engage your brain rather than write boilerplate sentences?\nWhy do you need\
  \ to have the company explain the error to you? And what precisely do you mean by\
  \ \u201Cdealt with\u201D?\nHere is the reply I would have thought fitting from an\
  \ educational establishment.\n\u201CWe now realise that one of our public signs\
  \ is illiterate and gives a thoroughly bad impression of the school. This ought\
  \ to have been picked up, at least by the English-teaching staff, but nobody noticed.\
  \ Now you have brought it to our attention we will tear the sign down and replace\
  \ it with one that is written in correct English.\u201D\nReply came there none.\
  \ Six months on, the signage is still there. It really is appalling.\n[2013-06-01]"
