text: "It was an overcast morning in July. Pansy Cradledew was up and about at an\
  \ ungodly hour. Some time later, her inamorato woke up, and, glugging his morning\
  \ coffee, asked:\n\u201CSo what have you been up to so early in the day, my sweet,\
  \ my darling dear?\u201D\n\u201COh, I pulled the head off a bat,\u201D replied Pansy.\n\
  Her inamorato spluttered a mouthful of coffee and almost choked, until it became\
  \ clear that the bat in question was not some flesh and blood and sinew pipistrelle,\
  \ but a model bat made from terracotta-coloured modelling clay. Pansy, it transpired,\
  \ had fashioned a figurine of the hideous bat god Fatso, his \u201Clook\u201D based\
  \ on the equally hideous bat god Camazotz, and the removal of the head was a temporary\
  \ measure to expedite the drying and setting process. Nonetheless, her crack o\u2019\
  \ dawn activity led to the conversational exchange reported, causing much merriment\
  \ and the splitting of sides.\n[2011-07-13]"
