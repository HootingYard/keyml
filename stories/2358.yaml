text: "It has been quite a while since I have drawn attention to George Orwell's daily\
  \ egg count, as I am sure all my readers are keeping abreast of it of their own\
  \ volition. Today's entry, however\u2014or rather, the entry for this day seventy\
  \ years ago\u2014is rather intriguing, and raises, in my mind at least, certain\
  \ questions.\nRaining most of the day, & cold. 14 eggs. [From 25 April to 9 May\
  \ Diary is written in Eileen's hand.]\nNow, we are used to one egg or two eggs,\
  \ and very rarely three eggs, but fourteen? Can it be mere accident that this anomalous\
  \ number of eggs is counted on the very day that Eileen has commandeered the writing\
  \ of the diary? Has George been lying? Is it conceivable that all along the daily\
  \ egg count has been higher than he has reported, and that he has been hiding the\
  \ undeclared eggs from Eileen? One pictures Orwell sneaking off to the eggery while\
  \ Eileen is out on an errand, making himself a secret omelette, perhaps, or hardboiling\
  \ a clutch to carry in his pockets and give as gifts to any orphans and distressed\
  \ widows he meets on his roamings. Or, conversely, is Eileen pretending to a larger\
  \ egg count than is true, for her own purposes, which we can only guess at?\nWe\
  \ shall have to see how many eggs are reported between now and the ninth of May,\
  \ when Eileen gives George his pen back.\_\n[2009-04-25]"
