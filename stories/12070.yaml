  \ black and white films.\nSo there is much tippy-tapping taking place at Haemoglobin\
  \ Towers, but none of it is being posted here, or indeed anywhere. The reason for\

  \ \u201Ccommercially viable\u201D, and I am preparing a book to be brought mewling\
  \ into the light by a reputable publisher next year. For that reason, too, there\

  \ be something for you to get your grubby mitts on in time for Christmas\u2014more\
  \ news of that soon.\n[2013-10-16]"
