text: "Continuing very briefly with the political slant, I felt impelled this morning\
  \ to fire off an email to Boris Johnson. This is what I wrote:\nDear Mr Johnson\n\
  I just stumbled upon an online sample of quotations from your collection Lend Me\
  \ Your Ears, in one of which you claim that ping-pong was first called whiff-whaff.\
  \ I think you may be mistaken. Ping-pong was, at least in Britain, originally known\
  \ as \u201CGossima\u201D, and marketed as \u201CCausing immense excitement and healthy\
  \ exercise and is the nearest approach that can be to the game of lawn tennis as\
  \ played out of doors\u201D (1901).\nI trust that in the m\u0207l\xE9e of your constituency\
  \ duties and campaigning for the London Mayoralty, you will do the decent thing\
  \ and arrange for a correction to appear in any future edition of the book. Ideally,\
  \ of course, you will also make a public statement on the matter. Such willingness\
  \ to acknowledge past errors does smack a little of Stalinism, but may go down well\
  \ with the ping-pong community.\nYours sincerely,\nFrank Key\n[2007-10-18]"
