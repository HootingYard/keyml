text: "I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of\
  \ my troubles. The font was hewn from adamantine rock, and the water it contained,\
  \ though of necessity holy water, was icy. When the priest slopped it on to my bashed\
  \ head, I screamed at such a pitch that a stained glass window depicting the martyrdom\
  \ of St Bibblybibdib (spikes, tongs, fire) was shattered. A falling shard sliced\
  \ the priest's jugular, and he collapsed, but not before dropping me into the font.\
  \ While I splashed about, bawling and freezing, minuscule organisms with which the\
  \ water was riddled swam into my ears, and burrowed tiny tunnels into my brain,\
  \ wherein they laid their eggs. If the organisms were minuscule, imagine how microscopically\
  \ wee were their eggs! Before death claimed me, I was plucked from the font by the\
  \ sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy I was almost suffocated as he clutched\
  \ me to him. Gurgling, I was passed to my mother, a woman of great dottiness who\
  \ endangered my life many a time in the following months, usually by taking me to\
  \ unsuitable picnics\u2014unsuitable in that they took place in snowstorms or, during\
  \ balmier weather, on steep hillsides down which I would roll, gathering pace as\
  \ I approached, at the bottom, a railway line or major arterial thoroughfare along\
  \ which huge container lorries thundered. Fortunately, though perplexingly, the\
  \ sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time.\nMiraculously, I survived\
  \ into toddlerhood. Around this time my mother began to encourage me to play on\
  \ the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was grateful for the rubber\
  \ bootees and lead-lined swaddling jacket the sexton gave me. More than once I toppled\
  \ from the roof into the moat, and I soon learned to swim skilfully to dodge both\
  \ the sharp-fanged scavenger fish and the unexploded mines therein. Regular swimming\
  \ while wearing raiment of lead does wonders to build up one's muscular strength,\
  \ and sure enough by my sixth birthday my mother was exhibiting me at circuses and\
  \ freak shows. I was known as Little Dagobert, The Strongest Boy In The Universe.\
  \ Sometimes I came close to being flattened by the steamrollers I pulled across\
  \ lawns and village greens, until the sexton gave me a handy tip to avoid even the\
  \ gentlest of downhill inclines.\nBeing of an implausibly rare blood group, I had\
  \ to be extra careful in the vicinity of sharp knives, axes, and slicers. My caution\
  \ served me well when, on my tenth birthday, my mother had me apprenticed to a well-known\
  \ butcher. He was a florid, chubby, deranged and blood-drenched man, who took both\
  \ pride and pleasure in his inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for\
  \ days after he slew the sexton and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal\
  \ pie-fillings. I resolved to run away to sea, though we lived far, far from any\
  \ coast.\nOne crisp autumn's dawn I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied\
  \ them in a bundle and tied the bundle to the end of a stick, and with the stick\
  \ propped jauntily over my shoulder I set out to make my way in the world. Before\
  \ I got so far as the garden gate, however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all\
  \ hatched at once, and let forth monsters. Though I had passed through much travail\
  \ in my short life, things were about to get much, much worse.\n[2011-01-11]"
