text: "The other day on Channel 4 News, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott was\
  \ reported as saying that David Cameron had \u201Cthrown himself off the negotiating\
  \ horse\u201D. I had not previously come across this type of horse, but I am always\
  \ keen to keep abreast of the doings of our dear leaders, so I did what all lazy\
  \ researchers do in the twenty-first century and looked it up on Google. The Brin-Page\
  \ Engine fobbed me off by providing me with endless links to \u201Cnegotiating house\
  \ prices\u201D, and when I insisted that I did indeed mean \u201Chorse\u201D and\
  \ not \u201Chouse\u201D it seemed to think I wanted to negotiate to buy a horse,\
  \ which was never my intention.\nNow your average clot or fathead would conclude\
  \ from this that there is no such beast as a negotiating horse, and that Lord Oakeshott\
  \ was either making it up or had suffered from some kind of brain spasm leading\
  \ to delusions. Such is the mindset that credits Google, and the interweb, with\
  \ knowing all there is to know. But I still have faith in books, of reference and\
  \ otherwise, and in order to track down the negotiating horse, and to acquit myself\
  \ of the charge of engaging in perpilocution, I set myself the task of reading through\
  \ a swathe of horse literature.\nI shall not detain you by listing the many many\
  \ many books, journals, encyclopaedia entries, dictionary definitions and other\
  \ materials I read. Suffice to say that I would be well qualified to give the correct\
  \ answers to hundreds of horsey quiz questions, were I to be so quizzed. Yet in\
  \ my untold hours of study I did not come upon a single reference to the so-called\
  \ negotiating horse. If such a thing did exist, it would seem that it only did so\
  \ within the head of Lord Oakeshott.\nHow easy it would have been, then, to dismiss\
  \ the negotiating horse as a phantasm! Particularly, I would aver, given its provenance.\
  \ After all, when one thinks of the members of the British House of Lords, one does\
  \ not think automatically of powerful, erudite minds\u2014quite the contrary. Whereas\
  \ once the red benches would have been crammed with hereditary inbred aristocrats,\
  \ now one finds a collection of time-serving lickspittle has-beens. That, at least,\
  \ is a popular perception. But I harbour a deep respect, unfashionable perhaps,\
  \ for some of our great institutions, and I was prepared to give Lord Oakeshott\
  \ the benefit of the doubt. That is why, having read and read and read, in the field\
  \ of horses, to no avail, I decided to go back to his original, reported, pronouncement,\
  \ in case I might glean from it something I had previously overlooked.\nThe Prime\
  \ Minister, it was suggested, had \u201Cthrown himself off the negotiating horse\u201D\
  . What did this tell us about the horse? If Cameron had thrown himself off the horse,\
  \ he had clearly mounted it in the first place. This fact precluded it being, say,\
  \ a clothes horse or a seahorse, two types of horses I had taken care to include\
  \ in my research. Although it is possible to clamber on to, and to steady oneself\
  \ upon, a clothes horse, it is unlikely one would do so in order to negotiate anything\
  \ with anybody, isn't it? One would look somewhat foolish, which is never a good\
  \ starting point for even the lowest level negotiations. And of the seahorse, nothing\
  \ further need be said. No, if Cameron had mounted the negotiating horse, which\
  \ needs must he would have done in order to throw himself off it, there were only\
  \ two types of horse it could be\u2014a real, living, snorting horse of bone and\
  \ muscle and sinew, such as those photographed in motion by Eadweard Muybridge in\
  \ the latter part of the nineteenth century, or a gymnasium or pommel horse, of\
  \ wood and metal and leather, as disported upon by gymnasts and, in some cases,\
  \ circus performers.\nIn either case, it would need to be a horse big enough for\
  \ a minimum of two persons to be mounted upon, for one does not negotiate solo.\
  \ Thus, if it were a real horse, it is unlikely to have been one of the smaller\
  \ breeds, such as the Dartmoor pony or the falabella. As for pommel horses, they\
  \ can be manufactured to any size required. It is not outwith the bounds of possibility\
  \ that a special pommel horse, specifically designed for negotiating upon, and able\
  \ to sit comfortably six, or twelve, or even more, might have been made, for the\
  \ purpose.\nThere is of course also the possibility that the \u201Cnegotiating horse\u201D\
  \ is just what it says\u2014a horse that actually carries on the negotiation, in\
  \ which case Cameron may well have sat upon it by himself, in a stable or barn alongside\
  \ other world leaders mounted upon their own negotiating horses, which, depending\
  \ upon the physical size of the world leader, may even have been Dartmoor ponies\
  \ or falabellas. Quite how a horse would negotiate, with its limited repertoire\
  \ of snorts and whinnies, is another matter, and one which will require further\
  \ study.\n[2011-12-19]"
