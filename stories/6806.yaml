text: "After a break, I have returned to John Tilbury's mammoth biography of Cornelius\
  \ Cardew. It is 1966; Cardew is swanning about in Buffalo, New York while back in\
  \ London his wife Stella struggles with four children and virtually no money in\
  \ their top-floor flat off Warwick Road. She writes a stream of letters to Cardew\
  \ complaining bitterly about the couple who have come to stay at the flat. They\
  \ add to both her childcare responsibilities, leaving her to act as nursemaid to\
  \ their pneumonia-wracked child while they go off gallivanting to swish parties,\
  \ and to her financial problems, in that they never contribute a penny towards the\
  \ housekeeping\u2014this in spite (or more likely because) of what Stella describes\
  \ as their exaggerated and unseemly preoccupation with money. She is desperate to\
  \ get rid of them, but all her efforts fail until eventually Cardew writes a letter\
  \ ordering them to leave.\nAnd the names of these charming guests? The man is Tony\
  \ Cox, and the woman is his then wife, a Japanese artist called Yoko Ono.\n[2011-06-29]"
