text: "One rain-lashed November morning in the latter half of the 1950s, Dobson awoke\
  \ from uneasy dreams and succumbed to a fit of ornithomania. At the breakfast table,\
  \ after fletcherising his steamed dough \u2018n\u2019 gooseflesh flan, he announced\
  \ to Marigold Chew \u201CO inamorata o\u2019 mine! What the world needs is a pamphlet,\
  \ decisively written, on the flight patterns of the common shrike.\u201D\nMarigold\
  \ Chew let this intelligence sink in while she munched her kedgeree. This was the\
  \ period, it ought to be noted, when the out of print pamphleteer and his belle\
  \ kept to differing breakfast menus, later to be chronicled in the pamphlet-cum-recipe\
  \ book A Thousand Breakfasts In Five Hundred Days (out of print).\nMunching done,\
  \ Marigold Chew asked pointedly, \u201CAre you intending to pen this pamphlet yourself,\
  \ Dobson?\u201D to which the pamphleteer replied, after a long pause while he masticated\
  \ a mouthful of flan thirty-two times, \u201CYes, of course!\u201D\nMarigold Chew\
  \ sighed. \u201CDobson,\u201D she said, not unkindly, \u201CYou know nothing of\
  \ the shrike. I doubt you could tell one apart from a robin or a starling or a pratincole\
  \ or even a vulture. How the hell are you going to write, decisively or otherwise,\
  \ about the flight patterns of a bird of which your ignorance is limitless?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI have a one word answer to that,\u201D replied Dobson, \u201CResearch!\u201D\
  \nSo it was that, when his breakfast was fully digested, Dobson clambered into his\
  \ Galician Zookeeper's boots, donned a threadbare waterproof, and stalked out into\
  \ the rain. He made for the top of Pilgarlic Tor and stared at the sky for hours.\
  \ When he returned home, he was drenched, and dusk was descending.\n\u201CWell?\u201D\
  \ asked Marigold Chew, \u201CWhat have you learned?\u201D\n\u201CThe sky is a vast\
  \ expanse,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CAcross which clouds scud, and from these clouds\
  \ falls rain, now as drizzle, now in sheets, hence the puddle forming at my feet\
  \ which I shall mop up with a mop on the end of a stick when I have done enlightening\
  \ you, my darling dear. From time to time, below the scudding clouds, birds soar\
  \ and swoop across the sky. Some go flitting until they can no longer be perceived\
  \ by the human eye, some come into land on the branches of trees or in nests built\
  \ high or low in trees or even in hedgerows. There are many different types of birds,\
  \ many more than the ones you catalogued over breakfast this morning. Each has a\
  \ distinctive manner of keeping itself airborne. Through keen and judicious observation,\
  \ one can learn to differentiate one type of bird from another, purely from its\
  \ method of flight, without needing to get close up to it, for example while it\
  \ is resting in its nest or on a tree-branch. As my pamphlet will be devoted exclusively\
  \ to the common shrike's flight patterns, that closer observation in the nest will\
  \ not be necessary. That is fortunate, for I much prefer to stand windswept and\
  \ rain-lashed upon the top of the tor than to be hunkered in shrubbery for hours\
  \ on end, where I would be subject to biting by insects and other things that crawl\
  \ upon the earth, and in shrubs.\u201D\n\u201CThere are goos one can smear upon\
  \ the skin to repel such creatures,\u201D said Marigold Chew, waving her hand towards\
  \ a wall-mounted cabinet wherein such goos were stored.\n\u201CThat may be so,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson, \u201CBut if you are listening attentively you will grasp that for\
  \ present purposes I need no such repellant.\u201D\n\u201CSo will you be standing\
  \ atop Pilgarlic Tor again tomorrow, staring at the sky?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\
  \u201CI will not,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CFor tomorrow I will be consulting works\
  \ of ornithological reference in the library.\u201D\nAnd lo! it came to pass. The\
  \ following morning, after a breakfast of eggy buns (Dobson) and lightly grilled\
  \ hen-head with tomatoes (Marigold Chew), the pamphleteer was to be found poring\
  \ over an enormous ornithological reference work in the ornithological reference\
  \ library reading room. In those days, libraries were havens of quiet in what Pratt\
  \ dubbed \u201Cthe hurly burly of the urban conurbation\u201D, and the only sounds\
  \ to be heard were the frantic scraping of Dobson's very very sharp pencil as he\
  \ scribbled upon his jotter, and the strangulated choking of a fellow bird researcher\
  \ with a predilection for high tar cigarettes. Dobson was making notes from his\
  \ study of The Boys\u2019 And Girls\u2019 Bumper Book Of Shrikes. He copied out\
  \ one passage in its entirety:\nNow, tinies, let me tell you why the shrike is known\
  \ as the \u201Cbutcher bird\u201D. You see, it is a rapacious and violent little\
  \ birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talons insects, small birds and even teeny\
  \ weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews. Once caught, it impales its victim upon\
  \ sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently-sized\
  \ fragments, and serves as a sort of pantry or larder so the shrike can return to\
  \ the uneaten portions at a later time. Its call is strident. You will probably\
  \ have nightmares about it now, but it is well to learn that nature is a realm of\
  \ blood and gore.\n\u201CHow did you get on at the library?\u201D asked Marigold\
  \ Chew when Dobson returned. He had trudged home in a downpour, and a puddle was\
  \ forming around his feet, which today were clad in a pair of Paraguayan Mining\
  \ Inspector's boots.\n\u201CIt looks as though I will have more mopping up to do,\
  \ o light of my life,\u201D said Dobson. \u201CYou will no doubt be pleased to hear\
  \ that I have formed a plan of campaign for the accomplishment of what I suspect\
  \ will be one of my most important pamphlets.\u201D\n\u201CI am glad to hear it,\u201D\
  \ said Marigold Chew, who was knocking back a beaker of some fluid she had strained\
  \ through a sieve earlier that day. Its colour was indescribable, and it was pip\
  \ free.\nDobson took his jotter from an inside pocket of his raincoat.\n\u201CListen\
  \ to this!\u201D, he said, in an excitable voice, \u201CThe shrike is a rapacious\
  \ and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talons insects, small\
  \ birds and even teeny weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews. Once caught, it\
  \ impales its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller,\
  \ more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a sort of pantry or larder so\
  \ the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. Its call is strident.\
  \ And that's not all, but you get the gist.\u201D\n\u201CI do,\u201D said Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CBut what is your plan of campaign and when are you due to set it in\
  \ motion?\u201D\n\u201CUsing keen and judicious observation, from atop Pilgarlic\
  \ Tor, I will wait to spot a bird impaling an insect or a smaller bird or a fieldmouse\
  \ or a shrew or some other tiny mammal upon a thorn. \u2018That,\u2019 I will say\
  \ to myself, possibly out loud, \u2018is a shrike!\u2019 It will then be a simple\
  \ matter of watching it fly away from the thorn and to trace, with my pencil, in\
  \ my jotter, the patterns it forms in the sky. This diagram will then form the basis\
  \ for an accompanying text, which will describe the patterns, in decisive prose.\u201D\
  \nThe next morning, Dobson ate lobster for breakfast while Marigold Chew had mashed\
  \ up cake \u2018n\u2019 crumpets \u2018n\u2019 cornflakes. Then the pamphleteer\
  \ headed out for Pilgarlic Tor in the torrential rain. He stationed himself in the\
  \ vicinity of a thorn bush, near the summit, and watched, keenly and judiciously,\
  \ all day. That was Thursday. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday\
  \ were identical in all particulars except, of course, for the breakfasts. By the\
  \ time dusk descended on the second Thursday, Dobson was soaked to the skin and\
  \ had yet to spot a shrike. He returned home crushed and despondent. Marigold Chew\
  \ could tell from the misery etched upon his countenance that his plan of campaign\
  \ was yet to bear fruit, but as the pamphleteer stood in a puddle in his Latvian\
  \ Ice Rink Attendant's boots, contemplating the mopping he would shortly be engaged\
  \ in, she asked, \u201CDid you spot a shrike today, Dobson?\u201D\n\u201CI did not,\u201D\
  \ he moaned, in a voice ancient and sepulchral.\n\u201CI did,\u201D said Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CJust after you left this morning I went out into the garden to cast\
  \ my gaze admiringly upon the hollyhocks, and gosh, all of a sudden a bird swooped\
  \ into view, a newborn hamster struggling in the vicious grip of its talons, and\
  \ I was jolted by a wave of nausea as I watched the bird impale the poor tiny thing\
  \ upon a thorn in the thorn bush next to the hollyhock patch beside the shed. Somehow\
  \ I managed not to vomit all over the lawn, and I realised the bird was a shrike,\
  \ so I ran indoors for my sketchpad and propelling pencil and rushed back out in\
  \ time to see the shrike fly away, thereupon executing a highly accurate rendering\
  \ of the patterns it formed in the sky until, some minutes later, it was lost to\
  \ view in the overcast grey immensity of the rain-raddled empyrean.\u201D\n\u201C\
  And you're sure it wasn't a pratincole?\u201D asked Dobson.\n\u201CAs sure as eggs\
  \ is eggs,\u201D said Marigold Chew, brandishing the relevant page of her sketchpad\
  \ in the pamphleteer's face, now transformed by joy.\n\u201CThis is fantastic news!\u201D\
  \ cried Dobson, and he sprang forward and clutched Marigold Chew in an embrace of\
  \ boundless love. And that is why the pamphlet Flight-Patterns Of The Common Shrike\
  \ by Dobson (out of print) has the subtitle With A Tremendously Accurate Diagram\
  \ by Marigold Chew.\nIn closing, it is worth noting that Dobson's text, far from\
  \ being decisive, is incoherent, jumbled, and in places quite potty, probably because\
  \ in the bliss of their wild embrace, Marigold Chew's sketchpad was dropped into\
  \ the puddle of rainwater, and became smudged. The diagram as published was newly\
  \ drawn, from memory, a few days later, and was by no means as tremendously accurate\
  \ as claimed. In fact, a reputed ornithologist has said that the flight patterns\
  \ represented are typical, not of the shrike, but of the pratincole.\n[2010-06-01]"
