  \ It was shortly after breakfast time on a cold and storm-tossed morning in the\
  \ 1950s at the home of the twentieth century's most magnificent pamphleteer. Dobson\
  \ had eaten his bloaters. Marigold Chew had something eggy. They were still sitting\
  \ at their breakfast table. Outside, hailstones were pinging.\n\u201CMarigold, o\
  \ my darling dear,\u201D boomed Dobson, \u201CI have devised a marvellous plan!\
  \ Listen carefully. You often comment upon what you consider to be my breathtaking\
  \ ignorance of the natural world. And though I usually swat away your charges, as\
  \ a giant may swat away a dwarf, I have, this day, found within myself a reservoir\
  \ of humility, and I must admit there is a certain truth in what you say.\u201D\n\
  Marigold Chew interrupted here, to suggest she capture Dobson's words upon a tape\
  \ recorder for the settling of any future contretemps, but the pamphleteer pressed\
  \ on.\n\u201CThat being so,\u201D he said, \u201CMy plan is to increase my knowledge\
  \ in the best way possible, and what method could be more efficacious than to write\
  \ a book about what I do not know? And not just any book. I shall take as my guide\
  \ that great ancient encyclopaedia by Pliny The Elder, the Natural History, and\
  \ rewrite it in its entirety! To ensure I cover the sweeping width and breadth of\
  \ all natural phenomena, I\_ shall follow slavishly the chapter and section headings\
  \ of the great work, but, subjoined to them, the texts shall be my own! Is that\
  \ not a fantastic plan and a superb way to extend my knowledge of that which you\
  \ claim me to be ignorant.. of, again, I think, if I am to be grammatically sound?\u201D\
  \n\u201CAre you sure you mean \u2018subjoined\u2019, Dobson?\u201D asked Marigold\
  \ Chew, who was in chucklesome mood.\n\u201CI am not one hundred percent certain,\
  \ no, but let that pass, o my inamorata. The thing is, I have decided to begin the\
  \ project this very day, not at the beginning, but plunging straight in to the tenth\
  \ book of Pliny, which you will recall is the one in which he addresses matters\
  \ ornithological. That is an area in which you suggest my ignorance is boundless\
  \ and unfathomable, so it will be the perfect test bed. And no, I am not sure I\
  \ mean \u2018test bed\u2019, but let that pass too, for the time being.\u201D\n\u201C\
  I am quite happy to do so,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CFor now my eggy breakfast\
  \ is digested, I am going off and out to a beekeeping bonanza jamboree. Get thee\
  \ to thy escritoire, and when I return I shall be happy to have you read to me the\
  \ initial scribblings of your Natural History, a book I am sure will knock Pliny\
  \ from his plinth.\u201D\nDobson took this repartee in good part, scurried to his\
  \ escritoire, sharpened a pencil, and flung open his dusty copy of Pliny at the\
  \ tenth book. The nature of birds. (i-ii) The ostrich, the phoenix, he read. He\
  \ closed his eyes and tried to summon a vision of an ostrich and a phoenix, first\
  \ separately, then together. He was determined not to cheat by reading what Pliny\
  \ The Elder had had to say on the subject nearly two thousand years ago. Then the\
  \ pamphleteer shook his head, like a man waking from a jarring dream, opened his\
  \ eyes, and began to scribble with his sharpened pencil on the first page of a brand\
  \ new notepad.\nBoth the ostrich and the phoenix, he wrote, are birds, the one real,\
  \ the other mythical. On the front of the head of the real bird, there is a beak.\
  \ And, lo!, what do we find on the front of the head of the bird of myth? It too\
  \ has a beak! And this is not the only feature they have in common, for the bodies\
  \ of both birds bear plumage in the form of feathers.\nDobson looked upon what he\
  \ had done, and saw that it was good. No doubt there would be more to say about\
  \ both the ostrich and the phoenix, but he felt he had, at the very least, cracked\
  \ the method he planned to employ. Pliny would be his guide, but only his guide.\
  \ The grand sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose would be Dobson's alone. He went\
  \ to take a post-breakfast nap.\nWhen he awoke, the pamphleteer's brain was befuddled\
  \ after a series of dreams, the details of which, so vivid in sleep, vanished pfft!\
  \ the instant his head rose from the pillow. He opened a can of revivifying Squelcho!\
  \ and poured it into a tumbler, then sat again at his escritoire to consult his\
  \ Pliny. Eagles\u2026 vultures\u2026 hawks\u2026 owls\u2026 woodpeckers\u2026 it\
  \ was a long, long list of things with beaks and feathers! Dobson threw his pencil\
  \ across the room, donned his greatcoat and his Belgian Post Office Inspector's\
  \ boots, and went out in the teeth of the hailstorm to trudge along the towpath\
  \ of the filthy old canal to clear his head. He saw a number of birds while on his\
  \ trudge, not one of which was either an ostrich or a phoenix. He threw a pebble\
  \ at a swan. He stopped in at Old Ma Purgative's Canalside Lobster Hatchery \u2018\
  n\u2019 Winter Sports Togs Bazaar, and browsed among the lobsters and the winter\
  \ sports togs, but in spite of the Old Ma offering bargains galore in a special\
  \ \u2018hailstorm sale\u2019, Dobson, enmired in penury as ever, bought nothing.\
  \ Eventually he trudged back home, passing the puddle in which the pebble he had\
  \ thrown at the swan had somehow fetched up, as pebbles do. And as pamphleteers\
  \ do, he returned to his escritoire, sharpened another pencil, and, jaw set in determination,\
  \ cast his eye over the Pliny. Peacocks\u2026 bustards\u2026 swans\u2026 hoopoes\u2026\
  \ partridges\u2026 goat-suckers\u2026 this last reminded Dobson that he had a goat-milk\
  \ popsicle in the refrigerator, and he was about to go and fetch it, for a midmorning\
  \ snack, when, towards the end of the contents of Pliny's tenth book, he read instances\
  \ of affection between snakes and a bomb exploded inside his brain.\nSuddenly Dobson\
  \ recalled the dream from which he had awoken befuddled after his nap. He remembered\
  \ it in every last detail, for it was his recurring dream, the one that flickered\
  \ in his sleeping cranium on so many, many nights, and in so many, many daytime\
  \ naps, and had done since infancy. He turned to a fresh page of his notepad, and\
  \ began scribbling.\nWhen I was a tot, he wrote, I had a favourite bedtime story\
  \ which I implored my ma or pa to read to me before I fell asleep. I drank my bedtime\
  \ beaker of milk of magnesia and settled my little head on my little pillow, and\
  \ listened, night after night, to the tale which, ever since, has haunted my dreams,\
  \ and about which it is incomprehensible that I have not written a pamphlet until\
  \ today. Well, thanks to Pliny The Elder, now I can address that omission. The story\
  \ began as follows:\nOnce upon a time there was a boa constrictor named Dagobert.\
  \ He was loitering on a verdant slope when he happened to spot a passing vole. Dagobert\
  \ uncoiled himself, pounced, sank his fangs into the tiny vole, and gulped it down\
  \ in one fangsome mouthful. But before his digestive juices could begin to reduce\
  \ the paralysed but yet living vole into nourishing pulp, along came a viper named\
  \ Clothgard.\n\u201CMy oh my!\u201D thought Dagobert, \u201CWhat a lovely viper\
  \ she is. I feel a great pang of affection for her.\u201D\nClothgard herself was\
  \ a sore vexed viper, for she had not eaten for many days.\n\u201CO boa constrictor\
  \ loitering on the verdant slope, canst thee help a sore vexed viper who has not\
  \ eaten for many days? My name is Clothgard,\u201D hissed Clothgard.\nSo mighty\
  \ were the pangs of affection felt by Dagobert that he immediately regurgitated\
  \ the vole and offered it to the famished viper.\n\u201CWhy thank you,\u201D she\
  \ hissed, \u201CYou are quite the most charming boa constrictor it has ever been\
  \ my pleasure to meet.\u201D\nThere was more to the story, much more, but it was\
  \ always around this point that, as a tot, I fell into my golden slumbers, and ma\
  \ or pa placed the storybook gently by my pillow and tiptoed away.\nThis you will\
  \ recognise, I expect, as the opening of Dobson's important pamphlet The Significance,\
  \ In My Long-Ago Infancy, Of An Undigested Vole (out of print). He was still scribbling\
  \ away furiously, possessed by a pamphleteer's demons, when Marigold Chew arrived\
  \ home. Thinking he was at work on his revision of Pliny, she did not interrupt\
  \ him, but went straight into the back garden with the new bees she had brought\
  \ back from the bonanza jamboree. Not until a few days later, when she asked Dobson\
  \ if he had yet written his chapter on the nature of puff-eggs, addled eggs, and\
  \ wind-eggs, did she learn that the pamphleteer had abandoned his Pliny.\n\u201C\
  Oh that,\u201D he said, over breakfast, \u201CIt's just one bird after another.\
  \ I can't be doing with it.\u201D\n[2010-07-20]"
