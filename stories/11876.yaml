text: "There is an elephant in the room. It is pushing the envelope and thinking outside\
  \ the box, and what it is thinking about is not rocket science. Elephants are among\
  \ the more intelligent members of the animal kingdom, but their brains cannot cope\
  \ with the complexities of rocket science. It is more likely that the elephant is\
  \ thinking about food, and when next it might find some vitamin-rich leafage to\
  \ munch. Not that it would have any concept of vitamins, any more than of rocket\
  \ science.\nSo, anyway, there is this elephant in the room, with an envelope and\
  \ a box. It must be a reasonably big room, for an elephant to fit into it, and one,\
  \ moreover, with a l'age d'or. Sorry, I mean a large door, sufficient in height\
  \ and breadth to allow the passage through it of a great big galumphing elephant.\
  \ The lobby of an important hotel fits the bill.\nSomebody has placed in the lobby\
  \ an envelope and a box. They may have been put there before the arrival of the\
  \ elephant, or after. It doesn't matter, for Christ's sake! With regard to the envelope,\
  \ it is a pretty straightforward matter that the elephant has chosen to push it\
  \ across the floor, by exercising its trunk. Whether or not the envelope is sealed\
  \ or open, whether it is empty or contains some document\u2014a legal writ, a love\
  \ letter, a coupon snipped from a magazine\u2014the elephant neither knows nor cares.\
  \ We might surmise that it is pushing the envelope because that is something for\
  \ it to do, to keep it occupied, or because the presence of the envelope on the\
  \ floor of the lobby is an irritant, to the elephant, which would prefer an unsullied\
  \ space in which to plod about.\nThat the elephant is thinking outside the box is\
  \ blindingly obvious. Unless it is an enormous box, the elephant is not going to\
  \ fit inside it, is it? Even if the box is big enough to receive an elephant, it\
  \ would have to be an elephant of rare daintiness to succeed in clambering into\
  \ the box without crushing it in the process. It is, after all, a cardboard box.\
  \ We can assume that, not only is the elephant thinking outside the box, it is ignoring\
  \ it, at least for the time being, while it is busying itself pushing the envelope\
  \ across the floor with its trunk and thinking about food.\nEverything might change,\
  \ of course, when the elephant pushes the envelope as far as the wainscot and can\
  \ push it no further. It is anybody's guess what will happen next.\n[2013-08-22]"
