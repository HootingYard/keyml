text: "Today, for reasons I shall not bore you with, my attention is drawn to the\
  \ 2005 Hungarian film Fekete kefe, directed by Roland Vranik. This synopsis could\
  \ scarcely fail to entice any devoted Hooting Yardist:\nFour fake chimney sweeps\
  \ prowl on rooftops, in pubs & flats of Budapest and in the stomach of a goat. Love,\
  \ history, friendship and religion pull each other's weights but in the end there\
  \ is absolutely no solution. Zoli, D\xC3\xB6fi, Papi and Anti goes to the rooftops\
  \ one morning to sweep the chimneys but they are meeting a strange housing-estate-goat\
  \ so they are getting totally confused and everything goes chaos. After their hard\
  \ day they find the key to escape in the stomach of the goat\u2026\nIt's shot in\
  \ black & white, too. I may have to write about a quartet of fake chimney sweeps\
  \ and a \u201Cstrange housing estate goat\u201D, and should probably do so before\
  \ seeing what I have already convinced myself is a masterwork of cinema.\n[2009-02-09]"
