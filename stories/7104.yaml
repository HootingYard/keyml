text: "I really ought to avoid Facebookcloth, though I find myself popping in regularly\
  \ for the simple reason that certain persons of my acquaintance seem to have forgotten\
  \ the ancient art of email. Keeping in touch with them necessitates reading their\
  \ Facecloth postages. The danger is that, at times, one gets sucked in and embroiled\
  \ in lengthy and increasingly witless exchanges. Today has been one of those times,\
  \ what with the riotous state of the nation. Here, then, are edited highlights from\
  \ a few ill-spent hours.\nLet us begin on a high note. Oh, before doing so, a word\
  \ about \u201Cfriends\u201D. All contacts on Facecloth are \u201Cfriends\u201D,\
  \ irrespective of the nature of one's acquaintanceship. I prefer the Google+ approach\
  \ of \u201Ccircles\u201D, which can be of friends, family, work colleagues, and\
  \ so on. Best of all, one can define one's circles, which is why the six people\
  \ I \u201Cknow\u201D on Google+ have all been put into a circle called \u201CHonorary\
  \ Captains Pursuivant Of Hooting Yard\u201D. This is likely to remain a decisively\
  \ elite group until such time as there is a mass migration from Facecloth to Google+.\
  \ We shall see.\nNow, where was I? Ah yes, that high note. In among much blather\
  \ about the riots, one friend of mine made the definitively sensible comment: \u201C\
  I think the rioters just need to calm down and listen to some Soft Machine\u201D\
  , to which was appended a link to Hibou, Anemone and Bear from the dazzling second\
  \ album.\nPondering how else the feral hoodie teenpersons might be better occupied,\
  \ I was reminded of a comment made three years ago by Elberry on his now defunct\
  \ Lumber Room. Fortunately, I quoted it here at the time, so it has not vanished\
  \ entirely into the ether. He was writing about knife-crime rather than brick-throwing,\
  \ looting and arson, but his point holds good:\nI imagine there are several thousand,\
  \ or hundreds of thousands, of young men carrying knives \u2018in self-defence\u2019\
  \ who will, however, pull it as soon as they imagine a confrontation is in the air.\
  \ They would be far better to carry expandable batons, and far less likely to accidentally\
  \ kill someone. They would do even better to stay at home reading Sir Philip Sidney.\n\
  This always seemed to me a sensible, practical, and realistic suggestion, and I\
  \ was happy to quote it in rioting context on Facecloth. Cheering, too, that a number\
  \ of my friends \u201Cliked\u201D it and, as one commented,\nI said (almost exactly)\
  \ that to my partner. Why are they not at home reading a book? Any book, even.\n\
  I am afraid this led me to give vent to my inner misanthropic reactionary (as tends\
  \ to happen on Facecloth), and I immediately replied:\nProbably because their teachers\
  \ were too busy with the self-esteem and diversity lessons to get round to teaching\
  \ that \u201Creading\u201D thing.\nThere is a serious point here. We are always\
  \ hearing the teenpersons and their adult representatives complain that \u201Cwe\
  \ have nothing to do\u201D. No doubt this has been a teeny moan since time immemorial,\
  \ but it is of course bollocks. Certainly in a city like London there is a myriad\
  \ of \u201Cthings to do\u201D that don't cost money, even if one is reluctant to\
  \ sit at home reading a book.\nBut why bother making so obvious a point when there\
  \ is drivel to be spouted? Perhaps it is the (Facecloth) company I keep, but I have\
  \ been astonished by the attempts to dress moronic footwear-thieving barbarism in\
  \ politico-intellectual clothing. This, for example, ought to have left me speechless:\n\
  just back from Hackney, nostrils full of the aroma of burning rubber, zone superlatively\
  \ tense yet totally a-okay\u2026 aside from some poor fuckers with insurance claims\u2026\
  \ platitudes re: lumpen-prole mindless thuggishness = a vulgar simplification by\
  \ mainstream media (who were barely visible)\u2026 TSG chest-beating all night but\
  \ totally ineffectual\u2026 subjective experience too complex to analyse right now,\
  \ I think.. complex .. and fast.. and slow..\nAlas, instead of remaining silent,\
  \ I felt impelled to respond:\nWill it be exciting if [your area] is next and [your\
  \ trendy and with-it workplace] gets trashed and burned?\nTo which came the reply:\n\
  I never said it was exciting, c'mon Frank\nI then said that \u201Csuperlatively\
  \ tense yet totally a-okay\u201D sounded to me almost like a definition of \u201C\
  excitement\u201D, but this was denied. Suffice to say that the exchange continued\
  \ until both of us, I am sure, were only too pleased to retire from the fray, neither\
  \ having changed our minds one whit. It really is a foolish way to spend one's time,\
  \ and I ought to remember that.\nStill, hanging around on Facecloth did at least\
  \ mean that I saw this, wholly unrelated, link, posted by another friend:\nMatchless.\
  \ And, as the friend pointed out, note Alfred Hitchcock doing his cameo role in\
  \ the background.\n[2011-08-09]"
