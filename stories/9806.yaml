text: "Not being an evildoer myself, I find it hard to believe that one of my fellow\
  \ creatures\u2014what am I saying?\u2014a monster, indeed, could have obliged a\
  \ woman to point a revolver at his head, and I am even less capable of explaining\
  \ his flight.\nI am no hero of bravado, but I am not afraid; I do not court danger,\
  \ but I have courage, sustained energy, and a will of iron . . . To be killed by\
  \ a bullet from the revolver of a pretty woman, held in an adorable hand, aimed\
  \ by eyes that could make an Andalusian's pale by comparison . . . Few men can hope\
  \ to die that way.\nIn this life, one is exposed to many things: one can be bitten\
  \ by a mad dog, stung by a fly, run over by an omnibus, or be the victim of a derailing.\
  \ A termite can slyly find its way into your ceiling, you can suddenly receive some\
  \ bad news, you can catch cholera, you can burn your mustache, you can be blinded\
  \ by a falling star, you can have a mother-in-law, you can lose your umbrella .\
  \ . .\nHippolyte Bazard, in a letter to Henriette Francey after she had threatened\
  \ him with a pistol. A few days later, she shot him dead. Quoted in Victorian Murderesses\_\
  : A True History Of Thirteen Respectable French And English Women Accused Of Unspeakable\
  \ Crimes by Mary S Hartman (1977)\n[2012-08-04]"
