text: "This is a guest post\_ by Vladimir Ilyich Foxglove\nIn his piece on the Hooting\
  \ Yard to O'Houlihan's Wharf branch line, Mr Key at one point tries to emphasise\
  \ the horribleness of the Horrible Cave by suggesting that \u201Cit makes every\
  \ other cave\u2026 seem like a Prudence Foxglove Sunday School\u201D. We are meant,\
  \ I think, to gasp and gawp at the force of the contrast. Well, I for one do not.\
  \ I am Prudence Foxglove's grandson. I was both a pupil and, later, an instructor\
  \ in her Sunday Schools. What I know, which Mr Key clearly does not, is that each\
  \ and every one of my grandma's religious and moral education hubs was situated\
  \ in a deep and dark and dank and damp and gloomy cave. This makes a nonsense of\
  \ Mr Key's attempt at vividness.\nMy grandma decided to set up a network of Sunday\
  \ Schools because she was much troubled by the moral dereliction she witnessed all\
  \ around her. In a letter to the football ace known as \u201Cthe daisy cutter\u201D\
  , Steve Bloomer (1874\u20131938), she listed some of the things she had seen on\
  \ a weekend outing:\nI saw a gravedigger with an unwaxed moustache, a butcher without\
  \ a hat, a tiny cadet loitering near a bordello, an urchin with rickets whistling\
  \ in the presence of a widow, a tippety fellow manipulating figs, a wretch in the\
  \ gutter, a Papist on the loose, and I saw much else besides.\nConvinced that the\
  \ nation's moral resurgence could only be effected by brainwashing every five-year-old\
  \ in the land, Prudence Foxglove fell under the spell of the pedagogue Walter Mad.\
  \ Mad is best-known today for his involvement in a curious postage stamp scandal,\
  \ but it ought not be forgotten that he was the author of dozens and dozens of tracts,\
  \ the one that compelled my grandma's attention being An Essay Upon The Brainwashing\
  \ Of Five-Year-Olds Through A System Of Pedagogy Conducted Within The Confines Of\
  \ Dank And Gloomy Caves.\nMy grandma went to meet Walter Mad to discuss his ideas.\
  \ The man was an athletic, and, obviously, a most powerful ruffian. On his face\
  \ he carried more than one large glazed cicatrix, that assisted the savage expression\
  \ of malignity impressed by nature upon his features. And his matted black hair,\
  \ with its elf locks, completed the picturesque effect of a face, that proclaimed,\
  \ in every lineament, a reckless abandonment to cruelty and ferocious passions.\
  \ Prudence herself, familiar as she was with the faces of pedagogical madmen in\
  \ the dreadful hours of sack and carnage, recoiled for one instant from this hideous\
  \ ruffian, who had not even the palliations of youth in his favour, for he seemed\
  \ fifty at the least. But appearances, as we know, can be deceptive, and Walter\
  \ Mad was all bonhomie and good cheer, albeit of a stern Protestant kidney, and\
  \ not remotely the ruffian reminiscent of a minor character in Thomas De Quincey's\
  \ Klosterheim, or The Masque (1832) whom he so strongly, if not exactly, resembled.\n\
  My grandma was astonished at the scale of the pedagogue's ambition. He had a vision\
  \ of a vast network of caves where tinies would be entrapped from their fifth birthdays\
  \ onwards, learning by rote a curriculum of decisive moral rectitude. She fretted,\
  \ however, that Walter Mad seemed quite oblivious of the impracticality of his project.\
  \ She fired questions at him, to which he had no answers save an airy wave of his\
  \ arrestingly hairy hand.\nHad he sent out a scouting party of spelunkers to identify\
  \ caves suitable for his purpose? Conversely, was it his intention to employ a gang\
  \ of geologists familiar with explosives to blast brand new caves where now stood\
  \ only grim forbidding rock? How would he propel the tinies into his caves? Did\
  \ he see himself acting as a sort of Pied Piper of Hamelin figure? Was he not concerned\
  \ that so prolonged a stay in the cavernous gloom would ruin the sight of the tinies\
  \ and render many of them almost blind?\nPrudence swept away from their meeting\
  \ convinced that Walter Mad was a nutcase, and a sinister one at that. She wondered\
  \ if he had more in common with the Klosterheim ruffian than she had at first supposed.\
  \ I am not sure if she ever learned of his later involvement in that postage stamp\
  \ business, but had she done so, she would have felt to some extent vindicated in\
  \ her decision, when she arrived home, to make a waxen doll of Walter Mad and to\
  \ stick it with pins, with many, many pins.\nBut my grandma saw, too, that beneath\
  \ all the weirdness, there was a grain of sense in his cave-based education hub\
  \ scheme. His plans were too lavish, too grandiose, but reined in and properly organised,\
  \ they could, she thought, usher in a transformation in civic life. It was this\
  \ insight that made her, rather than Walter Mad, the true visionary.\nShe wrote\
  \ her own version of Mad's tract, entitled An Essay Upon The Brainwashing Of Five-Year-Olds\
  \ Through A System Of Pedagogy Conducted Within The Confines Of Dank And Gloomy\
  \ Caves, But Only On Sundays, and threw herself into making it a reality. She took\
  \ on an assistant, a man even more like the Klosterheim ruffian than Walter Mad.\
  \ This fellow's name was Ed Balls, incidentally, though as far as I know he was\
  \ unrelated to the current government minister. Balls sought out apt caves, kitted\
  \ them out with Sunday School furniture and equipment, and appointed tweedy bespectacled\
  \ types to teach the tinies, allowing Prudence Foxglove to concentrate on devising\
  \ the curriculum, much of which was devoted to the more alarming passages in the\
  \ Old Testament, with a leavening of twee drivel about fluffy animals and pretty\
  \ flowers and submarine warfare.\nTwo generations of five-year-olds were brainwashed\
  \ at my grandma's Sunday Schools, and it is an experience none of them forgot. Balls,\
  \ as we know, turned out to be a less than competent judge of caves, for one by\
  \ one they suffered collapses, or flooding, or seismological trauma, until no trace\
  \ of Prudence Foxglove's magnificent obsession remained.\nIn closing, may I say\
  \ what a fantastic time I have had writing this piece for Hooting Yard, and should\
  \ I be invited to contribute again, I have a cupboard full of articles ready to\
  \ publish, including several about beatniks, one about the shovelling of agricultural\
  \ waste materials, and a potted biography of Ed Balls. Not my grandma's assistant,\
  \ but the new one, the government minister.\n[2009-02-24]"
