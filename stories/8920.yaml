text: "Two things serve to persuade me that the Ancient Egyptians were a peculiarly\
  \ dim-witted rabble.\nThere is a tendency to regard the great civilisations of the\
  \ past through rose-tinted spectacles. One thinks of Edgar Allan Poe, writing of\
  \ \u201Cthe glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome\u201D in To Helen\
  \ (revised 1836) or Neil Young babbling, of the Aztecs, that \u201Cthe women all\
  \ were beautiful and the men stood straight and strong\u2026 Hate was just a legend\
  \ and war was never known\u201D in Cortez The Killer (1975). I think we may safely\
  \ say that these aper\xE7us are what Ambrose Bierce, using a favourite term, would\
  \ call \u201Cbosh\u201D. What we overlook, with our romanticising blinkers, is the\
  \ stark fact that much of human history was attended by filth and squalor and hunger\
  \ and disease and slavery and violence and stink and flies and rats and brutality\
  \ and terror and mud and ignorance. All that, of course, being your daily lot if\
  \ you managed to live long enough to experience it, which untold millions, given\
  \ infant mortality rates, did not.\nIn view of this bloody awful state of affairs,\
  \ let us imagine some Ancient Egyptians, broiling one afternoon under a battering\
  \ sun.\n\u201CI have an idea,\u201D says one, \u201CLet's tramp into the desert\
  \ and build an enormous, windowless, pointy-topped edifice of no practical use whatsoever.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI have a better idea,\u201D says the other, \u201CLet's build two!\u201D\
  \nNow you or I might have thought of more constructive ways to spend our time. But\
  \ not the Ancient Egyptians, who went on to build over a hundred of these pointless\
  \ pointy-topped buildings all over the arid hellhole where they lived. It is all\
  \ very well to say that they were in thrall to a particularly vicious and mercurial\
  \ pantheon of gods, but it seems to me that only supports my theory of their fundamental\
  \ stupidity. Other civilisations, at other times, have also laboured under the delusion\
  \ that they were ruled by deities we might sensibly consider as nutters, and dangerous\
  \ nutters at that, but few have built such pointless yet enormous and pointy-topped\
  \ structures. Others do exist, but not in such profusion as in Ancient Egypt.\n\
  Their enthusiasm for wasting their lives in the tremendous effort of building these\
  \ idiocies is the first thing that persuaded me of their dim-wittedness. I asked\
  \ myself what could have prompted such tomfoolery, and that led me to the second\
  \ point. What possible hope could there be, I concluded, for a civilisation that\
  \ worshipped cats?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore cats. I am definitely a cat person\
  \ rather than a dog person, and have in the past had several pet cats, and never\
  \ a pet dog. There are few experiences as conducive to relaxation as being slumped\
  \ in an armchair with a purring cat dozing on one's chest. But there is a deal of\
  \ difference between a feeling of affection towards, say, a tabby called Tiddles\
  \ for whom one is happy to provide bowls of food, and a sense of abject awe and\
  \ subjection towards Bastet, or Bast, or Baast, or Ubasti, or Baset, the cat goddess\
  \ of the Ancient Egyptians.\nThe thing we must always remember about cats is that,\
  \ for all their grace and elegance and litheness and poise, they are unfathomably\
  \ stupid creatures. Some will protest that an animal that has so arranged things\
  \ that it can spend its life eating food from a bowl, sleeping, playing with wool\
  \ or shoelaces, and chasing small mammals and birds has clearly worked something\
  \ out. Perhaps so. The average domestic cat lives the life of Riley, and one I find\
  \ mightily enviable. Given half the chance I would arrange my affairs likewise.\
  \ But let us keep things in perspective. Far from being a divine being possessed\
  \ of great power and wisdom, the cat is a halfwit. You only have to observe them,\
  \ hopelessly chasing birds which\u2014surprise, surprise!\u2014fly away as soon\
  \ as they come close, or gazing intently at nothing on the wall of a room, or toppling\
  \ off a windowsill when half asleep, to recognise that, whatever is going on in\
  \ the cat's brain, it is neither complicated nor astute.\nWhat, then, does it tell\
  \ us of a civilisation that it elevates the cat to a godhead, and duly worships\
  \ it? It tells us, I think, that the Ancient Egyptians must have been ineradicably\
  \ thick. And the evidence is all those pointless pointy-topped buildings, constructed\
  \ with unimaginable toil in the middle of nowhere, for no pressing reason.\nI rest\
  \ my case.\nADDENDUM\_: In pondering the sheer ridiculousness of the brain of the\
  \ cat, I am reminded of a little geographical mystery. In the last decade of the\
  \ previous century, I often had reason to visit the city of Bristol, the northern\
  \ part bordering South Gloucestershire to be more precise. Looking at maps, I noticed\
  \ that on many of them the area had the name \u201CCatbrain\u201D emblazoned across\
  \ it. Yet whenever I asked a local person about this nomenclature, I was met with\
  \ blank looks. Nobody I questioned had ever heard of Catbrain, and I concluded that\
  \ it must have been one of those mapping mistakes which, committed once by a slapdash\
  \ cartographer, was then repeated by others. I now learn, from the Wikipedia, that\
  \ Catbrain\u2014or, properly, Catbrain Hill\u2014does actually exist, though I am\
  \ rather disappointed to discover that the name has nothing to do with the brains\
  \ of cats and is derived from the Middle English \u201Ccattes brazen\u201D, which\
  \ is a reference to the rough clay mixed with stones that is the characteristic\
  \ soil type thereabouts. None of which explains why the locals had never heard of\
  \ it. Unless, of course, it is one of those eerie English countryside locations\
  \ that are kept secret from interlopers.\n[2012-04-14]"
