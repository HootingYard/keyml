text: "According to Hargrave Jennings, in Curious Things Of The Outside World\_: Last\
  \ Fire (1861), \u201CThere are moments in the history of the busiest man when his\
  \ life seems a masquerade. There are periods in the story of the most engrossed\
  \ and most worldly-minded man, when this strong fear will come, like a cloud, over\
  \ him; when this conviction will start, athwart his horizon, like a flash from out\
  \ a cloud. He will look up to the sunshine, some day, and in the midst of the business-clatter\
  \ by which he may be surrounded, a man will, in a moment's glance, seem to see the\
  \ whole jostle of human interests and city bustle, or any stir, as so much empty\
  \ show. Like the sick person, he will sometimes raise his head, and out of the midst\
  \ of his distractions, and out of the grasp which that thing, \u2018business\u2019\
  , always has of him, he will ask himself the question, What does all this mean?\
  \ Is the whole world awake, and am I asleep and dreaming a dream? Or is it that\
  \ the whole world is the dream, and that I, in this single moment, have alone awakened?\u201D\
  \nThat great twentieth-century pamphleteer, Dobson, woke up in this state of mind\
  \ every single morning of his adult life. And that was not the end of his confusion,\
  \ for Dobson was a great one for naps, he took a nap daily, very often more than\
  \ one, plural naps, as it were, and each time he woke from his naps he likewise\
  \ asked himself the questions posed by Hargrave Jennings, as he had already done\
  \ on the morning of the day, when first he awoke.\n\u201CDo you have the slightest\
  \ idea,\u201D asked Marigold Chew, one blustery blizzardy Monday in the late 1950s,\
  \ \u201CHow tiresome it is to have you lumbering about the place like a dippy person,\
  \ asking the kinds of questions most sensible people stop posing when they outgrow\
  \ their years of teendom?\u201D\nDobson's reply to this perfectly reasonable query\
  \ was most annoying.\n\u201CAre you really speaking, Marigold, or am I just imagining\
  \ this conversation within the wispy mysterious mists of mystery?\u201D\nMarigold\
  \ Chew was holding a handful of pebbles, and proceeded to throw one at the pamphleteer.\
  \ No, that's not right. Marigold Chew was holding a Pebblehead paperback, and it\
  \ was this she threw across the room. The book was Pebblehead's latest bestselling\
  \ potboiler, The Interpretation Of Breams, a guide to foretelling the future using\
  \ a combination of fish and recordings of lute music. Luckily, the book missed Dobson's\
  \ head by an inch.\n\u201CI am going to go about my business in the real, palpable\
  \ world, Dobson,\u201D announced Marigold Chew, \u201CIf you choose to waft about\
  \ the place in a moonstruck daze, that is up to you. But it won't get any pamphlets\
  \ written!\u201D and she swept out of the house into the blizzard, bent upon her\
  \ real and palpable business, whatever it might have been that day.\nDobson picked\
  \ up the Pebblehead paperback from the floor and leafed through it, distractedly.\
  \ He read a few lines here and there, and decided to go out to the fishmonger's\
  \ and the record shop. But he got no further than the chair on which he sat to don\
  \ and to lace up his Canadian Snowplough Mechanic's boots, for, yet enmired in his\
  \ dreamy daze, he wondered if the chair, the laces, the boots were but figments.\
  \ \u201CFigments\u201D made him think of figs, and then of Fig Newtons, a type of\
  \ biscuit of which, at this period, he was inordinately fond, and, with his right\
  \ foot encased in a boot the laces of which were not yet tied and his left foot\
  \ merely ensocked, he rose from the chair and made for the cupboard wherein the\
  \ biscuits, and similar snack items, were stored. When he stood, he was, in boot\
  \ and sock, necessarily lopsided, and this being so, Dobson lost what balance he\
  \ had, and toppled, bashing his bonce on the wainscot.\nHe was unconscious for some\
  \ minutes, during which time he really did dream, of the glove of Ib and of his\
  \ weak Bomba, whatever that might mean.\nAnd of course, when he woke, sprawled on\
  \ the floor, the pamphleteer's swimming brain was yet again prompted to ask the\
  \ Hargrave Jennings questions. Round and round we go, in an endless cycle, akin\
  \ to the orbit of the planets around the sun.\nMarigold Chew was still out and about,\
  \ so Dobson was alone in his daze. Now wide awake, but still unable to gain a foothold\
  \ in the real, palpable world, he mooched about the house as a person might blunder\
  \ about in a thick fog, what they used to call a \u201Cpea-souper\u201D because\
  \ of the supposed similarity of the cloudy density of the air to the consistency\
  \ of soup made from peas, not to be confused with pease pudding, which is, as its\
  \ name suggests, a pudding, not a soup. Dobson was thinking neither of soup, nor\
  \ of the Fig Newtons, which he had utterly forgotten. He was doing things such as\
  \ tapping the walls with his fingertips, peering carefully at curtains, opening\
  \ and then closing doors, or in some cases leaving them ajar, as he tried to grasp\
  \ what was real and what was not. Stumbling past an airing cupboard into the bathroom,\
  \ he was astonished, in a bleary way, to come face to face with a monster of the\
  \ deep, wallowing in the tub. It was bloated, lascivious, coarse, and repulsive,\
  \ rather like Gertrude Atherton's vision of Oscar Wilde, except that it had fins\
  \ and hideous trailing tendrils, like those of a jellyfish. One such tendril now\
  \ lashed out and struck Dobson across the face, leaving, not just a vivid crimson\
  \ stripe, but droplets of an unbelievably aggressive toxin which seeped in seconds\
  \ through his pores and began ravaging his innards. The pamphleteer toppled once\
  \ again to the floor, this time of his bathroom rather than of his kitchen, still\
  \ wearing one boot, but now he was convulsed by fits, as if he were Voltaire's officer\
  \ with pinks in his chamber alluded to in another passage from Hargrave Jennings\u2019\
  \ very sensible book, and, like the officer, Dobson lost his senses.\nIn the tub,\
  \ the sea monster now began to gurgle, and to splash about. Suddenly, through the\
  \ bathroom window crashed Father Ninian Tonguelash, the Jesuit priest and self-styled\
  \ \u201CSoutane-Attired Nemesis Of Sea Monsters\u201D, clutching in one gloved hand\
  \ a harpoon and in the other a crucifix. Then\u2026\nThen\u2026\nThen\u2026 I awoke,\
  \ and I realised that all I have just written was a dream. Of course it was! Dobson\
  \ did not become the titanic pamphleteer he was by faffing about the place all muddleheaded.\
  \ When he woke up, every day of his adult life, he knew exactly where he was, and\
  \ if perchance there was a smidgen of doubt in the matter, he would in any case\
  \ plunge his head into a bucket of icy water, just to be on the safe side. How foolish\
  \ of me to confuse the hallucinations of my sleeping, pea-sized brain with the iron\
  \ truth!\n[2010-07-18]"
