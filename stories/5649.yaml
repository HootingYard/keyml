text: "A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned that I had armed myself with a trio of books\
  \ by or about Sabine Baring-Gould. I have now set to reading them, and so confident\
  \ am I that they will furnish much instructive and amusing material that it seems\
  \ a good idea to dub this postage the inaugural one in what I intend to be Sabine\
  \ Baring-Gould Week at Hooting Yard.\nLet us begin then, with a snippet from William\
  \ Purcell's 1957 biography, Onward Christian Soldier:\n\u201CSabine had a warm liking\
  \ for his tutor. And that he in return was looked upon with affection is surely\
  \ to some extent shown by the fact that he was asked by Mr Goodwin to choose his\
  \ wife's hats. Mrs Goodwin, it seems, had appalling taste. The results of leaving\
  \ her to dress herself could be shocking in the extreme. Her husband's pupil was\
  \ therefore asked, and apparently agreed, not only to accompany the lady in an advisory\
  \ capacity when she went shopping but also to inspect her before she left the house.\n\
  \u201CMr Goodwin was later made Bishop of Carlisle, a characteristic choice for\
  \ one of those bishops who, as the century progressed, found themselves faced by\
  \ forces greater than they were equipped to understand. Who supervised his wife's\
  \ choice of hats in Carlisle is not recorded.\u201D\n[2010-12-05]"
