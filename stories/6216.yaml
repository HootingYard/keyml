text: "A letter to John Waddington Ltd\u2026\nI understand your firm is the leading\
  \ manufacturer of playing cards and games and that you are always on the look-out\
  \ for novelties in this field.\nEnclosed herewith please find reproductions of two\
  \ pages from an ancient Aztec codex; kindly take a look at them.\nI am a philosopher-psychologist,\
  \ former lecturer at the University of Budapest. For the past few years I have been\
  \ engaged in some rather abstruse socio-anthropological research. In the course\
  \ of this work, as a sort of \u2018spin-off\u2019, I happen to have cracked the\
  \ code of the Aztec-Maya-Omec Tonalpouhalli (\u2018ritual year\u2019). This, even\
  \ if I say so myself, is quite an important academic achievement and will undoubtedly\
  \ create quite a stir in the appropriate circles when I publish my findings.\nFor\
  \ your information\u2014in case your acquaintance with the extinct Meso-American\
  \ cultures is no longer up to specialist standard\u2014the Tonalpouhalli was a \u2018\
  year\u2019 consisting of 13 20-day \u2018months\u2019\u2026 The Nahuatl word \u2018\
  Tonalpouhalli\u2019 translates as something like \u2018the arithmetic of destiny\u2019\
  \ and it forms the foundation of the Tonalamatl (\u2018The Book of Fate\u2019) which\
  \ consists of pictures only\u2026\nThe reason I am telling you this is that, with\
  \ the riddle solved, the Tonalamatl lends itself eminently well to a transformation\
  \ into a game akin to the phenomenally successful Monopoly, as well as to an ordinary\
  \ card game, as well as to a divinatory system similar to the Tarot cards\u2026\
  \ I feel that this holds considerable commercial possibilities.\nA letter from Dr\
  \ Charlotte Bach to John Waddington Ltd, quoted in Who Was Dr Charlotte Bach? by\
  \ Francis Wheen (2002). Wheen notes \u201CMessrs Waddington felt otherwise\u201D\
