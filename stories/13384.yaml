text: 'I was excited to note in the television listings that there is a showing this
  afternoon of a remake of the 1977 film Raid on Entebbe, entitled Raid on N. Tebbit,
  in which a crack team of Mossad agents attempts to rescue hostages from the home
  of a deranged octogenarian ex-cabinet minister.


  Readers may recall that the very same N. Tebbit was in the news a few years ago
  for attacking a child dressed in a dragon outfit.
