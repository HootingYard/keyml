text: "I was leafing idly through one of Pansy Cradledew's magazines when my eye was\
  \ caught by an article entitled The Mighty Changing Orifice, written by one Jacey\
  \ Boggs. Though the kettle was coming to the boil and I ought to have had the making\
  \ of tea on my mind, I found myself riveted by Ms Boggs\u2019 words. What was this\
  \ orifice? Why was it mighty? What changes had it undergone? All these questions\
  \ and more dizzied my poor pea-sized brain, and, ignoring the steaming kettle, I\
  \ read on.\nI learned that a hole and tube orifice \u201Cis the most common\u201D\
  , and is made by Ashford, Kromski, Lendrum, Louet, Schacht, and a variety of other\
  \ makers. Ms Boggs chided me \u201Cnot to discount them because they are unimproved,\u201D\
  \ (her italics), adding that some of her favourite breeds of sheep are unimproved.\
  \ This seemed to me a non sequitur, but I made a mental note of it. I like to gain\
  \ at least a vague idea of the personality of a writer whose words hold me spellbound,\
  \ and knowing that Ms Boggs was an aficionado of sheep told me something about her.\
  \ Admittedly, I was not sure what, precisely, it told me, but it was an arresting\
  \ confession to make, in the context of writing about the mighty changing orifice.\
  \ Not all of us care enough about sheep to have favourites among them, after all.\
  \ I did not, at least not yet, ponder the difference between improved and unimproved\
  \ sheep, in fact it was not at all clear to me what might be the nature of either\
  \ an improved or an unimproved sheep.\nBut I cast all thoughts of sheep from my\
  \ mind when I read the next line and was startled to discover \u201Cthere is nothing\
  \ that this orifice can't do as long as the size is right\u201D. Gosh!, I thought,\
  \ that would explain its mightiness, sure enough. Nothing it can't do? This \u201C\
  common\u201D orifice, then, could predict the weather?, tie my shoelaces?, make\
  \ a cup of tea?\nThinking of tea prompted me to put the magazine temporarily aside.\
  \ The kettle had come to the boil, so it behooved me to leap up and place a teabag\
  \ in a cup and pour boiling water upon it. I gave it a manly stir and added a plop\
  \ of milk and stirred it further and then I used the teaspoon to squeeze the teabag\
  \ against the inner side of the teacup, and then, very deftly, for I wished if possible\
  \ to avoid any spillage, I hoisted the teabag from the cup with the spoon and tossed\
  \ it into the bin, and then I ran the now empty spoon under the tap to rinse it\
  \ and I placed it, bowl-end up, in a cutlery container on the draining board. There\
  \ it shall rest, until such time as I make another cup of tea, or until I place\
  \ it in the cutlery drawer, when it is dry. Though I have described the making of\
  \ tea, it is something I do so often that I need not think about the process, so\
  \ all the while I was placing the teabag in a cup and pouring boiling water upon\
  \ it and giving it a manly stir and added a plop of milk and stirring it further\
  \ and then using the teaspoon to squeeze the teabag against the inner side of the\
  \ teacup, and then, very deftly, hoisting the teabag from the cup with the spoon\
  \ and tossing it into the bin and running the spoon under the tap to rinse it and\
  \ placing it, bowl-end up, in a cutlery container on the draining board, my mind\
  \ was still entirely concentrated on the mighty changing orifice. Had I not been\
  \ carrying a teacup full of boiling hot tea I think I would have scampered back\
  \ to the sofa at high speed, so keen was I to pick up the magazine and continue\
  \ reading. As it was, I made my way slowly and steadily, to avoid spilling my tea,\
  \ and only when the teacup was safely on the IKEA \u201CBenko\u201D table next to\
  \ the sofa did I sit and return to reading the words of Jacey Boggs.\nShe had mentioned\
  \ that the orifice could do anything so long as the size was right, and now she\
  \ turned her attention to this size. I was not particularly surprised to be told\
  \ orifices came in very small, standard, and larger sizes\u2014I might have guessed\
  \ as much\u2014but to be then told that \u201CAshford offers bushings that fit in\
  \ large orifices to decrease the size\u201D set my brain whirling. Quite apart from\
  \ the whole business of altering the size of the orifice with bushings, which might\
  \ be something to do with the \u201Cchanging\u201D promised in the title The Mighty\
  \ Changing Orifice, I was left to wonder why Ms Boggs brought up Ashford again but\
  \ had not another word to say about Kromski, Lendrum, Louet, or Schacht. Did they\
  \ not have their own bushings? If not, why not? It was all becoming more and more\
  \ mysterious. I took a sip of tea.\nIf I had hopes that all would become clear,\
  \ they were dashed. Ms Boggs wrote about \u201Cinnies\u201D and \u201Couties\u201D\
  , that an \u201Coutie\u201D often results in \u201Cthe wrap wrapping around the\
  \ extended orifice\u201D, that some orifices require an orifice hook, that use of\
  \ a Delta orifice means there is no flopping or thwapping regardless of grist, that\
  \ in addition to flopping and thwapping one might, if one is not careful, encounter\
  \ thumping or bouncing, and that in the 1970s Jonathan Bosworth designed an open\
  \ orifice shaped like a half moon or the letter C. It interested me that Ms Boggs\
  \ gave Bosworth's Christian name, a touch not afforded to Ashford, Kromski, Lendrum,\
  \ Louet, and Schacht. Was this because Jonathan Bosworth, or his orifice, was a\
  \ particular favourite of hers, like those unimproved sheep?\nBut answer came there\
  \ none. The article finished with the thoroughly confusing assertion that Bosworth\
  \ had done away with a need for an orifice hook, but that a \u201Chook orifice functions\
  \ in much the same way as the half-moon\u201D. For crying out loud!, I wanted to\
  \ shout, do I need a hook or do I not?\nAt this point, I remembered that the magazine\
  \ was not mine but Pansy Cradledew's, and of course I did not need a hook, nor indeed\
  \ one of Jacey Boggs\u2019 confounded orifices. What I needed was my cup of tea.\
  \ I threw the magazine across the room, picked up my cup, and took a hefty slurp.\n\
  The magazine, by the way, was Spin-Off, subtitled It's About Making Yarn By Hand,\
  \ an American publication from Interweave Press of Colorado. Among their other titles\
  \ are Handwoven, PieceWork, and Cloth Paper Scissors.\n[2012-04-15]"
