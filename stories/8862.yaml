text: "And so it happened that Maud, having resisted the blandishments of the cad\
  \ whose dearest wish was to coax her into the garden, repaired, not to her inner\
  \ sanctum to do her devotions, but to her sitting-room, where she collapsed on a\
  \ sofa and rang the bell to summon Baines, her slovenly yet devoted maidservant.\
  \ The bell in the scullery was cracked, and it clunked rather than rang, but it\
  \ had the desired effect, and Baines went staggering along the bungalow corridor\
  \ to her mistress, leaving smudges on the wall where she stopped to lean against\
  \ it, to catch her breath, every few paces.\n\u201CShall I be getting madam her\
  \ invigorating tisane?\u201D asked Baines, when eventually she toppled into the\
  \ sitting-room.\n\u201CYou may rise, Baines,\u201D said Maud, mistaking her maidservant's\
  \ sprawling upon the carpet as a posture of subservience rather than exhaustion,\
  \ adding \u201CAnd no, I have decided instead to take a goodly draft of laudanum.\
  \ Be so good as to fetch it.\u201D\nFetched it was, eventually, and Maud knocked\
  \ it back and fell into a welcome stupor, during which she dreamed vivid, unsettling,\
  \ and visionary dreams, so vivid and unsettling and visionary that as soon as she\
  \ woke from her opium daze, she dragged herself to her escritoire to record them\
  \ for posterity, and literature, and immortality. But hardly had she picked up her\
  \ biro than she was interrupted by an urgent hammering at the door.\nReaders alert\
  \ to anachronism will have spluttered at that mention of a biro. Surely, they will\
  \ ejaculate, a Victorian hysteric could not wield a biro to write down her effusions!\
  \ However, Maud's biro was not the biro invented by the Hungarian ballpoint pen\
  \ inventor L\xE1szl\xF3 B\xEDr\xF3, but a writing instrument of her own devising,\
  \ more akin to a steel-nibbed fountain pen, which she dubbed a \u201Cbiro\u201D\
  \ on account of a suggestive voice in her head which had spoken to her in a vivid\
  \ and unsettling and visionary dream during an earlier opium daze.\nThe wondrous\
  \ sights and sounds vouchsafed to her in the present dream, which she was going\
  \ to write down, were lost forever due to the hammering at her door. When, later,\
  \ she returned to her escritoire, she found, to her no small surprise and mortification,\
  \ that though she still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general\
  \ purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered\
  \ lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface\
  \ of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration\
  \ of the latter!\nThe slovenly yet devoted Baines, having glugged twice as much\
  \ laudanum as her mistress, was slumped insensible against the wainscot in a corner\
  \ of the sitting-room, so Maud went to answer the hammering at the door herself.\
  \ She opened it to reveal a man. He was of medium height, thin and sallow, with\
  \ grey whiskers, thick grey hair, bushy eyebrows, and small, pointed and inquiring\
  \ features which gave him rather the aspect of a prying bird. His eyes were little\
  \ and sparkling. His mouth, strangely enough, was ecclesiastical. He was clad in\
  \ very light-coloured clothes, yellow-grey tweeds, a yellow silk necktie, and a\
  \ fawn-coloured Homburg hat. And no human being had ever encountered him in a pair\
  \ of boots unprotected by spats. He was strikingly similar to the dweller on the\
  \ threshold in the story by Robert Smythe Hichens.\n\u201CGood day, madam,\u201D\
  \ he said, the more familiar, to us, \u201Chello\u201D, having not yet been introduced,\
  \ by Thomas Edison, as a common greeting, \u201CI am a person from Porlock, come\
  \ on business.\u201D\n\u201CWhere is Porlock, and what is your business?\u201D asked\
  \ Maud, who did not mince words with persons she supposed to be \u201Cin trade\u201D\
  .\n\u201CPorlock is a coastal village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated\
  \ in a deep hollow below Exmoor, five miles west of Minehead, madam, and my business\
  \ is of a delicate nature the like of which I would beg to suggest is better disposed\
  \ of indoors. May I come in?\u201D\nMaud was rather startled, but she did not forget\
  \ the social niceties, and instructed the person from Porlock to walk through the\
  \ grounds to the rear of the bungalow where he would find the tradesman's entrance.\
  \ He was not actually in trade, but the very thought of engaging in a discussion,\
  \ which might become an argument, with a Victorian lady on her doorstep caused him\
  \ such a mortification of the bowels that he immediately doffed his Homburg and\
  \ went off as he was bidden. Maud, meanwhile, slammed the door shut and returned\
  \ in haste to the sitting-room to rouse Baines. Baines had the only key to the tradesman's\
  \ entrance, and had naturally never divulged to Maud where it was kept. It was while\
  \ she was pouring a bucket of cold water over the prostrate form of her maidservant\
  \ that the last remembered fragments of her dream vision fled from Maud's brain,\
  \ and her chance of literary immortality was forever lost.\nSome hours having passed,\
  \ the person from Porlock was admitted to the parlour, where he laid his cards on\
  \ the table. They were Tarot cards.\n\u201CWhat devilry is this, sir?\u201D expostulated\
  \ Maud, who was a devout Anglican.\n\u201CI did say it was a delicate matter, madam,\u201D\
  \ said her visitor, and he removed his Homburg to reveal that his scalp was shaved\
  \ bare, and upon the flesh, in livid colours, was tattooed the number 666. And was\
  \ there a hint of the horns of a goat?\nTo be continued\u2026\n[2012-04-07]"
