text: "After that little interruption we return to our alphabetic schedule with L.\
  \ And as with G, L is a double bill, for L stands for both Lettuce and Leeks.\n\
  According to the BBC, there was much amusement recently when police in Hampshire\
  \ released an e-fit picture of a burglary suspect who appeared to be wearing a lettuce\
  \ on his head.\n\nWhat has gone unremarked is the possibility that the image may\
  \ be devastatingly accurate, and that it is the habit of burglars and other ne'er-do-wells\
  \ in the Hampshire area to sport the makings of salads upon their bonces. It would\
  \ not surprise me if some urban folklorist, attached perhaps to a polytechnic, was\
  \ at this very moment preparing a monograph on, say, the radish-wearing footpad\
  \ of Gosport, or the Winchester Watercress Rascal.\nA wider range of vegetables\
  \ has been used by miscreant scamps in the past, of course, though for hiding behind\
  \ rather than wearing openly upon the head. Six long years ago here at Hooting Yard\
  \ we dealt, in passing, with the case of the chap who skulked under cover of a serried\
  \ array of leeks hanging from a ceiling.\n\nIt just goes to show that sooner or\
  \ later the so-called \u201Creal world\u201D tends to catch up with Hooting Yard,\
  \ albeit sometimes at a slightly lopsided or tangential angle.\n[2010-09-24]"
