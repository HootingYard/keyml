  \ opposed to a Japanese) Prime Minister to be attacked by a killer robot. I am now\
  \ trying to cope with the idea of our political masters indulging in ritual goat\
  \ sacrifice\u2014perhaps not every day, but quite often. According to today's Guardian:\n\
  Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, has found solace in an unusual form\u2014\
  the ritual slaughter of goats.\nZardari has a black goat killed every day at his\
  \ Islamabad house to ward off \u201Cevil eyes\u201D and protect himself against\
  \ \u201Cblack magic\u201D, according to a report in Dawn, Pakistan\u2018s paper\
  \ of record.\nSpokesman Farhatullah Babar confirmed the president practises sadiqa,\
  \ or the sacrifice of an animal whose meat is distributed among the poor. \u201C\
  I have seen it been done. Not exactly every day, but quite often, yes,\u201D he\
  \ told the Guardian.\nBut he denied its purpose was to fend off malevolent spirits.\
  \ \u201CThe main belief is that this practice invokes the pleasure of God. The corollary\
  \ is that bad things will not happen, of course, but that's a matter of interpretation,\u201D\
  \ he said.\nI don't see the slaughtering of goats as Gordon Brown's thing, but it\
  \ would make sense with someone like Geoff Hoon.\_ He looks like a goat-killer,\
  \ as does his partner in that recent failed coup, Patricia Hewitt. I expect the\
  \ failure was due to their being so busy tippy-tapping conspiratorial drivel into\
  \ their Blackberries that they forgot to sacrifice a goat at the propitious time.\
  \ As for Miliband 1 and Miliband 2, they strike me more as the type to interpret\
  \ the bloody entrails of ritually slaughtered poultry.\n[2010-01-28]"
