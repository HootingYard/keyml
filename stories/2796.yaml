  \ on the fence of a sty and watch pigs. Help is at hand, however, for the pig-bereft\
  \ melancholic seeking to ease their woes. Dan Chambers sent me an extract from an\
  \ email from his Pa:\nIn his preface to The Anatomy of Melancholy Burton explains\
  \ that he wrote the book to rid himself of his own melancholia. This it failed to\
  \ do; Bishop Kennet wrote that Burton\u2018s only relief from despondency was to\
  \ lean over the footbridge at Oxford and listen to the bargemen swearing at each\
  \ other.\n[2009-08-04]"
