text: "Ask any halfway sane person where they go to find out the latest information\
  \ on peas, and chances are they'll say \u201CHooting Yard, of course!\u201D We have\
  \ a proud record of bringing pea news to the masses, and in keeping with that here\
  \ is a communiqu\xE9 from roving Hooting Yard reporter Tristan Shuddery, received\
  \ yesterday:\nDear Frank\_: This is an important fact that you may wish to file\
  \ somewhere in your\n  pulsating cranium. According to Wikipedia's article about\
  \ the aviator and recluse Howard Hughes: \u201CIn the 1930s, close friends reported\
  \ he was obsessed with the size of peas.\u201D\nAn earlier pea-related dispatch\
  \ is archived in October 2005 (see Monday 10th), but to save you looking it up I\
  \ thought I'd reprint part of it here:\nThey're small, green, solid, edible spheres,\
  \ and you eke them from pods. I am talking about peas, of course! Let us sing their\
  \ praises:\nAt the dinner tables of Hooting Yard / There's a food we hold in high\
  \ regard / Oh I wonder what can it be? / It's the little green edible sphere called\
  \ the pea!\nThe shelling of peas has long been recognised as a therapeutic activity\
  \ on a par with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic\
  \ patients should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning\
  \ over the fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist Tarpin Paltrow\
  \ suggested doing both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated\
  \ ever since.\nIt was Paltrow's student P K Spaceman who coined the term PQ, for\
  \ pea quotient. Your PQ is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten\
  \ in your lifetime, and divide it by your age. This figure can be plotted on a grid\
  \ against, for example, your body mass index, rotundity of head, shoe size, and\
  \ various phrenological data. Dr Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George's view\
  \ that Neville Chamberlain had \u201Ca wrong-shaped head\u201D and put this down\
  \ to a lack of peas in the latter's diet. Sometimes he attributed it to a lack of\
  \ peas in the former's diet, too.\nIn desperate circumstances, for example when\
  \ one's life is at risk, peas can become useful tools, or at least adjuncts to tools.\
  \ There is the story of the Antarctic explorer, clinging by his frostbitten fingertips\
  \ to the edge of a crevasse down which he was about to plunge, who managed to clamber\
  \ up on to the ice by fashioning a harness using ribbons, elastic bands and frozen\
  \ peas.\nPeas have been compared with planets, sometimes, by poets. The author of\
  \ the song we heard at the beginning of this piece wrote other pea-related verses,\
  \ in one of which he takes each planet in turn\u2014using the mnemonic \u201Cmud,\
  \ vinegar, ectoplasm, moorhens, jasper, straubenzee, unspeakable, Nixon, popinjay\u201D\
  \u2014and contemplates them as peas in a pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr Spaceman's\
  \ wild-eyed brain-sick patients. There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make of\
  \ that what you will.\n[2007-10-17]"
