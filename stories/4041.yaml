  \ reading And Then There Was No One by Gilbert Adair. (What the cravat is to Pebblehead,\

  \ used by Nabokov in Lolita:\nGlossy, furry, honey-coloured, honey-hued, honey-brown,\
  \ leggy, slender, opalescent, russet, tingling, dreamy, biscuity, pearl-gray, hazy,\
  \ flurry, dimpled, luminous, moist, silky, downy, shimmering, iridescent, gauzy,\
