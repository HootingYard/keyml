text: "Note well the co-ordinates of the rubbish dump. Lit lantern, hand-held, visibility\
  \ Stygian. Pebbles underfoot. Buck collar snug at the neck. Distant incomprehensible\
  \ keening. The mighty pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Satyrs cavort in the forest. A\
  \ galumphing peasant with a pail. The rubbish dump would appear to be not far from\
  \ the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Crows fly there, on the hour, timetabled. Clack\
  \ clack clack, rapid clacks. That kind of timetable. Rain on the pebbles. An orphan\
  \ choir sings a song.\nBob Crow, Bob Crow\n  Made out of dough\n  Eat him up with\
  \ salt and herring\nA biff in the chops from an unknown assailant. Fleeing in the\
  \ gutter. On All Hallows Eve, pictures of Jap girls in synthesis. The seven wonders\
  \ of another world. Resurrectionists scurry in the night. Spades at the ready. Bob\
  \ Crow, Bob Crow.\nSibelius was a terrible drunkard. A dog sniffing a ditch. Frisky\
  \ terrier, lumbering hound. Two dogs then. The Colossus of Rhodes. Young marble\
  \ giants. Wind in the rigging. A frump with a towel in a doorway, like Harry Lime\
  \ in postwar Vienna. Wheels within wheels. The windmills of someone else's mind.\
  \ Mind how you go, sir. There's room for one more inside.\nThere's room for one\
  \ more skip at the rubbish dump. Babylon or Chartres. Sing, sing, in a cathedral\
  \ choir. Nunc dimittis. And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that\
  \ he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. Bob Sparrow,\
  \ Bob Lark.\nRain in the gutters and filth on the stairs. I hear the sound of mandolins.\
  \ Now the orphans sing.\nBob Crow, Bob Lark, Bob Bobolink\n  Call for another round\
  \ of drinks\n  We are teetering on the brink\n  Let's fall into the abyss.\nVisibility\
  \ nil, in the abyss. Can I get a witness? Is there honey? Is there tea? No. You\
  \ have drained your cup. You could not make it up.\nA new ghost.\n[2014-03-25]"
