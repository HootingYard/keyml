text: "One vile broiling August afternoon, Blodgett sold his birthright for a mess\
  \ of pottage. Ever the wheeler-dealer, he then immediately sold the mess of pottage\
  \ to a wealthy fool for thirty pieces of silver. Blodgett licked his lips and punched\
  \ the air with his hairy fist. \u201CAt last!\u201D he thought, \u201CI have sufficient\
  \ funds to organise a picnic in the Garden of Gethsemane!\u201D\nBlodgett travelled\
  \ thither by hot air balloon. He was accompanied by his next door neighbours at\
  \ the time, a peevish couple who rarely spoke directly to each other but babbled\
  \ incessantly at Blodgett, who eventually stuffed cotton wool into his ears. For\
  \ all his faults, Blodgett was a singularly honourable fellow, and he felt a sense\
  \ of obligation to Mr and Mrs Fagash for a favour done to him long ago, though he\
  \ could no longer remember what it was. Thus he was able to kill two birds with\
  \ one stone, as they say, by fulfilling a personal picnicking ambition at the same\
  \ time as repaying a moral debt by providing a treat for an elderly impoverished\
  \ couple.\nThe picnic hamper was an exact replica, scaled down, of the balloon basket.\
  \ The wicker of which both were woven had even come from the same wicker factory.\
  \ Blodgett had stocked the hamper before the voyage with much provender from his\
  \ favourite picnic supplies shop. Without bothering to quiz Mr and Mrs Fagash on\
  \ any dietary preferences they may harbour, he had spent some of his pieces of silver\
  \ on sausages and lemonade and sandwich paste and pork scratchings and flan and\
  \ jam and buns and sultanas and mashed potatoes and raw liver and meringue and plums\
  \ and milk. The threesome took it in turns to keep flies away by waving fans, of\
  \ the same wicker as the hamper and the balloon basket. Flies, they knew, would\
  \ find a way to wriggle through the tiniest gaps in the wickerwork.\nIf it had been\
  \ vile and broiling back at home, it was even more vile and more broiling in the\
  \ Garden of Gethsemane when their balloon basket thumped to earth. Blodgett himself\
  \ broke out in a sweat so deep it was as it were great drops of blood falling down\
  \ to the ground, like Christ. Hearing a series of bangs from inside the hamper,\
  \ he realised the sausages were exploding. Mrs Fagash, who was a devout Catholic,\
  \ suggested they seek shelter from the sun in the misnamed Grotto of the Agony,\
  \ and as they staggered towards it, she explained the misnomer, dating back to the\
  \ removal of a stone in the fourteenth century. Blodgett found it hard to follow\
  \ what she was saying, and resolved to consult a reference work when he returned\
  \ home after the picnic. He was beginning to wonder how sinful it would be to abandon\
  \ Mr and Mrs Fagash in the grotto and make the trip back alone.\nIn all the years\
  \ he had dreamed of this picnic, Blodgett never envisaged that he would find himself\
  \ sitting in a dark cave eating raw liver in the company of a pair of scowling geriatrics.\
  \ Even the lemonade had gone flat, due to a bottling mishap. As he chewed and glugged\
  \ and swatted away flies, he reflected that perhaps he would have been better not\
  \ to sell his mess of pottage, which even now the wealthy fool would be lapping\
  \ up in the cool luxury of a shaded arbour. And he further reflected that it might\
  \ have been better never to have sold his birthright for the mess of pottage in\
  \ the first place. For what had he gained?, what had he gained?\nIt was this thought,\
  \ as gloomy as the gloom of the grotto, that was bloating in Blodgett's brain when,\
  \ inside the hamper, the last unexploded sausage exploded with a mighty bang. Birds\
  \ scattered from the branches of the olive trees outside.\n\u201CForgive me, Mr\
  \ and Mrs Fagash, for I know not what I do,\u201D blurted Blodgett. He stood up,\
  \ flicked crumbs from his person, and sprinted out of the Grotto of the Agony across\
  \ the garden to the hot air balloon. He clambered into the basket and set the burners\
  \ roaring, and very soon he was aloft, and he sailed away into the blue.\nSource\_\
