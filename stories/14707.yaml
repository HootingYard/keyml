text: "Our Lady of the Bumpkins is the object of dribbling veneration by the peasantry\
  \ hereabouts. That is pretty much all you need to know about her. More pertinent,\
  \ perhaps, is why the peasants\u2019 veneration is accompanied, always, by dribbling.\
  \ To find out, let us enter a peasant hovel. I would recommend a powerfully fragrant\
  \ nosegay.\nOnce our eyes become accustomed to the gloom, we can see a midden of\
  \ unutterable filth. Such is the home life of our own dear peasantry. Well, mayhap\
  \ not so dear. You will be thankful for the nosegay. You may also wish to have armed\
  \ yourself with a sharp pointy stick, to keep the peasant at bay should he approach\
  \ you. But there is little danger of that, because he is wholly occupied with veneration.\
  \ He is sprawled on the ground, mouth open, dribbling freely, his idiot gaze fixated\
  \ upon a statue of Our Lady of the Bumpkins. It is raised above the piles of gruesome\
  \ clutter, resting on a sort of shrine or altar. It emits an unearthly glow, and\
  \ is the one clean thing for miles around. When he is not venerating it, the dribbling\
  \ peasant spends untold hours spraying it with polish from an aerosol canister and\
  \ buffing it with rags.\nWe poke him with the pointy stick to gain his attention.\
  \ Still dribbling, he turns his head to look at us.\n\u201CCan you not venerate\
  \ Our Lady of the Bumpkins with your mouth closed?\u201D we ask.\nIn reply, the\
  \ peasant grunts, and returns to his dribbling veneration.\nBefore leaving, we note\
  \ that he collects his dribbles in a rough-hewn wooden cup, artfully placed beneath\
  \ his chin.\nAnd later, when we call in to the village's one-stop-shop to return\
  \ our rented nosegay and pointy stick, we note that there are shelves stacked with\
  \ similar cups of dribble. These are for sale, at a hefty price, to pilgrims who\
  \ come from far and wide. Thus does the One True Faith maintain the rural economy\
  \ in times of blight.\n\n[2016-06-07]"
