text: "Things have been quiet here for a while. That is because I have been concentrating\
  \ on completing my masterwork, the Summa Theologica. As its title indicates, this\
  \ is a theological summary which attempts to explain the ways of God to Man\u2014\
  or at least to my readership. It has involved untold research, over many years,\
  \ the collection of thousands, if not millions, of notes, all written painstakingly\
  \ in pencil on Nabokovian index cards. Now at last I have set about the task of\
  \ marshalling all this into a coherent narrative that is at once jaw-droppingly\
  \ erudite and also as readable as any airport bookstall blockbuster.\nThe opening\
  \ sentence is, in a sense, the summa theologica of the Summa Theologica. Having\
  \ consulted my notes, I wrote:\nIt is blindingly obvious, to even the most dim-witted\
  \ and wet-behind-the-ears six-year-old, that there is only one god, all-powerful\
  \ and all-knowing, and that is the hideous bat-god Fatso.\nUnfortunately, after\
  \ writing this, I reached an impasse. It is, indeed, blindingly obvious, so what\
  \ else is there to say? The simple truth is that we must all bow down or, better,\
  \ prostrate ourselves upon our bellies, like the creatures that creep upon the earth,\
  \ before the terrible countenance of the hideous bat-god Fatso, for ever and ever\
  \ Amen. If you do not grasp that fact, then you are doomed, yea unto the umpteenth\
  \ generation, and you will eat nought but nettles and drink nothing but evaporated\
  \ milk flavoured with the bitter tears of grumpy German film directors, and you\
  \ will be dressed in rags, and the rags will be besmirched with the blood of slaughtered\
  \ innocents, and your limbs will flail helplessly, and your brain will boil.\nIf\
  \ you require further evidence of the unflinchingly brutal reality of the hideous\
  \ bat-god Fatso, see here.\n[2016-03-30]"
