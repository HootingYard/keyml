text: "Poking about in a clogged flue with a wire brush, the noted historian of athletic\
  \ pursuits Alonzo Potentate was intrigued to find a reel of magnetic tape. Caked\
  \ as it was with the gunk of ages, he had it cleaned by professionals. And boy oh\
  \ boy were they professional! Operating from a cabin on a perilously steep incline,\
  \ the bods at Ancient Reels Of Magnetic Tape Cleaned Up Good And Proper With Swarfega\
  \ And Jets Of Steam R Us took seven years to restore the tape to \u201Cgood and\
  \ proper\u201D condition, by which time Potentate had grown a dashing moustache,\
  \ bitten his nails to the quick, and sat in many stadia watching many sporting events.\
  \ The day came, at last, when he could collect his find from the cabin on the incline,\
  \ and he hurried home to listen to it. To his delight, through hiss and crackle,\
  \ he heard the only interview ever to have been conducted with fictional athlete\
  \ Bobnit Tivol. Here is a transcript of that historic exchange. Sadly, we have no\
  \ idea of the identity of the interviewer.\nInterviewer\_: I am so pleased you have\
  \ agreed to be interviewed for my radio programme Magnetic Tape Recordings Of Athletes,\
  \ Fictional And Otherwise, Mr Tivol. May I call you Bobnit?\nBobnit Tivol\_: Puff\
  \ puff puff.\nInterviewer : You seem a bit out of breath.\nBobnit Tivol\_: Pant.\n\
  Interviewer\_: I expect your training session sprinting round and round this running\
  \ track for hours upon end has winded you somewhat.\nBobnit Tivol\_: Gack.\n[At\
  \ this point the interview is interrupted by guttural shouting. Alonzo Potentate\
  \ suggests this is the sound of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's all too real coach\
  \ and mentor Old Halob, demanding that the spindly sprinter essay another fifty\
  \ laps of the running track. The long stretch of hiss and crackle which follows\
  \ indicates that he does so, leaving the interviewer presumably waiting trackside,\
  \ looking on in awe.]\nInterviewer\_: So tell me, Mr Tivol, or Bobnit, would you\
  \ say that your fictional status has been a benefit to your career, or a drawback?\n\
  Bobnit Tivol\_: [Groaning sounds, interspersed with retching.]\nInterviewer\_: I\
  \ have heard it parlayed about that the tension between your wholly fictive existence\
  \ and the undeniable flesh and blood presence of Old Halob is what has spurred you\
  \ on to such achievement unparalleled in the field of provincial amateur athletics.\
  \ Would you agree?\nBobnit Tivol\_: [Gasping and spluttering.]\n[Again the interview\
  \ is interrupted by the catarrh-wracked bellowing of Old Halob, who this time thrusts\
  \ a polevaulting pole into his charge's hands, and commands him to vault over a\
  \ dizzyingly high bar, over and over again. There is a further half hour of hiss.]\n\
  Interviewer\_: You knocked the bar down a few times there, failing to clear the\
  \ jump. How did that make you feel, if indeed you are capable of feeling, being\
  \ a fictional athlete?\nBobnit Tivol\_: Pant pant pant.\nInterviewer\_: Some say\
  \ your coach Old Halob, over there in his trenchcoat and Homburg, is quite a hard\
  \ taskmaster, particularly given his background as a secret policeman in one of\
  \ the more rigorous East European Communist regimes. Is that true, or does he treat\
  \ you with kid gloves?\nBobnit Tivol\_: Gack.\nInterviewer\_: [To audience] And\
  \ with that, the fictional athlete goes haring off again, round and round the track\
  \ in the gathering dusk. I did try to get a word in with his coach and mentor, but\
  \ I'm afraid Old Halob has staggered off to a distant kiosk to get a carton of cigarettes.\
  \ Such are the ways of this legendary non-fictional athletics coach.\nAlonzo Potentate\
  \ has taken his transcript to Hollywood, where he is in talks to turn it into a\
  \ screenplay for a blockbuster movie. Word has it that Kevin Costner has expressed\
  \ an interest, though that seems unlikely, as the Kevster has a very limited range\
  \ of expressions, and they are, without exception, wooden.\n[2010-05-18]"
