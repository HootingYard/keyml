  But but but. Much as Hooting Yard readers may faint with pleasure at mentions of\
  \ cow-attack Blunkett and diminutive Great Helmswoman Blears and those curious little\
  \ Milibands, I have been asked to make a solemn promise not to babble about such\
  \ tosh. This means that you will be deprived of thirty-odd days of a Hooting Yard\
  \ Election Watch, unless of course I crack.\nApparently, if I do crack, and break\

  \ in a similar position to this hapless peasant:\n\n\u2026 which is a reminder to\
