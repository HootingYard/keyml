  \ the now defunct River Gods In Repose magazine, at that time one of the best-selling\
  \ \u201Cglossies\u201D. One terrible day, when the sun was blotted out and the sky\
  \ was black, a photographer came calling at Old Ma Bittergall's Grim Orphanage For\
  \ Cherubic Tots, where I was a day pupil. Our whole class was taken in a charabanc\
  \ to where Old Father Nile was sprawled, and we were told to disport ourselves upon\
  \ him, and lark about, so long as we stayed perfectly still at the snapper's command.\
  \ I remember the river god's breath stank of rotten fish. The cherubic tot to my\
  \ left, sitting on the god's shoulder, is my grate friend peason, who was uterly\
  \ wet and a weed.\n\n[2018-03-11]"
