text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tzipi Blankette, I recently stumbled upon your Hooting\
  \ Yard website and so enthralling did I find it that, using clever speed-reading\
  \ techniques, I have read the entire contents, dating back to 2003, in a matter\
  \ of hours. What has particularly impressed me is your tremendous erudition on the\
  \ subject of birds. I have always been interested in ornithology, passionately so,\
  \ but my knowledge of the subject is scant and flimsy. I can honestly say I have\
  \ learned more through speed-reading your work than from any other birdy source\
  \ at which I have supped, to put it poetically. Yes, Mr Key, I confess I am something\
  \ of a poet. The reason I am being so bold as to write to you is that I am currently\
  \ working on a sonnet sequence about little stints. I know almost nothing of the\
  \ little stint, but I read carefully your postage yesterday, where you gave, in\
  \ a footnote, an explanation of the term \u201Cunstinting\u201D. I would be enormously\
  \ grateful if you could expand upon this, and perhaps share with a poor Plathian\
  \ versifier your boundless knowledge of this tiny wading bird. Yours sincerely,\
  \ Tzipi Blankette.\nI often receive letters from bird-ignorant readers in awe of\
  \ my avian learning. Usually, I cast them straight into the pneumatic waste chute,\
  \ because, quite frankly, if I replied to them all I would never get any other work\
  \ done, and our feathered friends are just one teensy weensy fragment among my many\
  \ and varied interests, which also include the Kennedy Assassination, the Hindenburg\
  \ Disaster, eggs and bees, to name but four.\nIt so happened, however, that Ms Blankette's\
  \ letter plopped through the letterbox just as I was putting the finishing touches\
  \ to my new book, Crush Your Business Rivals By Unleashing Your Inner Little Stint.\
  \ This is the first in a series of management guides for top CEOs which I hope will\
  \ be bestsellers in the burgeoning market for management guides for top CEOs. Unfortunately\
  \ for Ms Blankette, however, I have already signed a contract with a global publishing\
  \ concern specialising in management guides for top CEOs, under the terms of which\
  \ I am unable to reproduce any of the text on this website. The book itself will\
  \ contain ninety-nine percent of my knowledge of the little stint, so all I am able\
  \ to do here to help out the fledgling poetess is to cobble together a few dribs\
  \ and drabs that didn't quite make it into my manuscript.\nUnder no circumstances\
  \ must you confuse the little stint with Temminck's stint. Try to remember the wise\
  \ old rustic saying \u201CWhen it comes to stints, there are two words / The little\
  \ and Temminck are different birds\u201D. Having said that, matters are confused\
  \ further by the fact that not only are there two words for the two different stints,\
  \ but there are dozens of other words for the little stint itself, depending on\
  \ where you are in the world. For example, you will be making a basic error if,\
  \ in some other, alien, distant land, out on a bird-spotting expedition with your\
  \ pals Lars and Prudence, you point your finger and shout \u201CLook, Lars and Prudence,\
  \ a little stint!\u201D What you ought to shout, assuming you know where you are,\
  \ is \u201CLook, Lars and Prudence, a\u2014\u201C followed by one of the following\
