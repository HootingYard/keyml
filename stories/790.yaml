text: 'If you wake up one morning to discover that the water supply from your well
  is frozen, the best thing to do is to clamber down the well, using the rope to which
  your bucket is tied, and to hack at the ice with an axe. You should wrap up warm,
  with a balaclava and a muffler and mittens, all of the finest wool, although you
  may find that your exertions, swinging that axe as best you can in the confined
  space at the bottom of the well, make you pant and perspire, and half way through
  your hacking you will want to climb back up the rope and take off some of your woollens
  before heading back down to continue the job. You can rest your axe in your bucket
  betimes, so long as the bucket is not given to tilting. If that is the case, the
  axe may fall out of the bucket into the freezing water you have just partly exposed
  by hacking sufficiently at its icy carapace, and your axe will sink like a stone.
  You would then need either to don skindiving gear to fetch it from flooded subterranean
  caverns, or to buy a new axe. In either case, the interval between your costume-change
  and dive or your purchase and your beginning once again to hack and hack and hack
  would probably result in the water at the bottom of your well being frozen again,
  if it was one of those mornings when the sky was overcast and a milky sun gleamed
  in vain.

  It may be that you have a neighbour close by from whom you can borrow an axe. But
  bear in mind that your neighbour''s well is likely to be frozen if yours is, and
  they will be hacking away themselves and thus unwilling to relinquish their axe
  just because you stupidly rested yours in a tilting bucket from which it fell.

  If you manage successfully to smash enough ice with your axe to uncover the water,
  climb back up to the top of the well and put your woollens back on. Now lower the
  bucket on the end of the rope until it is fully submerged and fills with water,
  winch it back up, untie the knot or knots with which it is attached to the rope,
  and carry the bucket to your delightful rustic haven, trying for as little spillage
  as possible. Remember that the water will be extremely cold, and will probably have
  shards of ice in it, so you will need to heat it up, even unto boiling point, before
  putting it to use, for example to make a cup of tea.

  Depending on the size of your bucket, you may want to return to the well to fetch
  more water before it freezes over again. You will need to pour the water out of
  the bucket into some other receptacle or receptacles, perhaps a series of pans.
  Then stride jauntily back to the well swinging the empty bucket, and greeting your
  neighbour, in a hearty countryside way. He may be approaching your fence because
  he wishes to borrow your axe, of course, and as you have finished your hacking it
  would be polite to lend it to him. If he has lost his own axe because he has a tilting
  bucket in his well, you might think it wise to give him some tips on how to tie
  his bucket to its rope so that it remains upright. Try not to give this advice in
  a pompous, shouty way, for your neighbour may have a short fuse and lose his temper
  and run amok with the borrowed axe across the fields, frightening cows and such
  other barnyard beasts as are congregated there in the bone-chilling cold of this
  misty winter morn.
