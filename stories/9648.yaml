text: "There is a land, remote and lovely, where the first three things likely to\
  \ strike the visitor are butter and clatter and taxis. You will ask, why those three\
  \ things, rather than, say, soap and watercress and canals, or toffee and rainfall\
  \ and pig iron? All I can say in return is that travellers to that land, upon their\
  \ return, eyes bright, buttonhole the stay-at-home and babble excitedly about butter\
  \ and clatter and taxis.\nBeing unreasonably obsessed with the Kennedy assassination,\
  \ I have just begun reading Stephen King's new Pebblehead-like big fat bestseller\
  \ 11.22.63. (I do wish it had been renamed 22.11.63 on our shores.) The conceit\
  \ of the book is that the narrator travels back in time to before that date, and\
  \ attempts to prevent the killing of the Potus. I mention this because one must\
  \ travel through time in order to visit the land of butter and clatter and taxis.\
  \ What is not clear to me is the direction of travel. Is this land plunged in the\
  \ past, or is it a future state? And how will I ever know, short of going there\
  \ myself?\nIn 11.22.63. as in many another time-travel narrative, the past is reached\
  \ via a portal, in this case the pantry of a diner. When I have questioned travellers\
  \ returning from the remote and lovely land of butter and clatter and taxis, they\
  \ invariably refuse to divulge the location of the portal, or indeed whether one\
  \ needs to pass through a portal to get there. There are, after all, other means,\
  \ like the eponymous contraption in H G Wells's The Time Machine. But nobody is\
  \ willing to tell me how I might get from here to there, wherever \u201Cthere\u201D\
  \ is. For the time being, I remain stuck in the here and now. That is not such a\
  \ bad thing, of course. It's what I am used to.\nYet I cannot help hankering. \u201C\
  Oh, the butter!\u201D, the returned visitors cry, \u201CIt is golden! Oh, the clatter!\
  \ It is curiously mellifluous! Oh, the taxis! How they careen along the wide important\
  \ boulevards of that remote and lovely land!\u201D It is all a far cry from the\
  \ margarine and din and traffic congestion of my own time.\nIt is decidedly odd\
  \ that the visitors are so keen to extol the virtues of that past or future land,\
  \ yet remain so reticent about how they came and went. Odd, too, now I come to think\
  \ of it, that the only virtues they extol are the butter and clatter and taxis.\
  \ I have asked them about other features, about soap and watercress and canals and\
  \ toffee and rainfall and pig iron, among other things, but they purse their lips\
  \ and look at me quizzically as if they have no idea what I am talking about. \u201C\
  Oh, forget about those things,\u201D they say, \u201CLet me tell you about the butter\
  \ and clatter and taxis!\u201D And they are off again, breathless with enthusiasm.\n\
  I have poked and prodded about the city in search of a likely portal, without quite\
  \ knowing what I am looking for. Qua King, I haunt pantries, particularly but not\
  \ exclusively those in diners and cafes and restaurants. Cooks and chefs and maitre\
  \ d's are none too pleased with me, and I am often escorted off the premises in\
  \ a ruffianly manner. Pantry does not equal portal, of course, and I try other points\
  \ of access, such as mysterious doorways and archways and gates and wickets. More\
  \ of these have a mysterious character than you might imagine. It has also occurred\
  \ to me that perhaps I need to catch some sort of magic bus, or coach, or a strangely\
  \ unscheduled train, and I have spent more hours than I care to count lolling about\
  \ at bus stops and railway stations, trying to spot telltale signs, ever in vain.\n\
  One day, my frustration at boiling point, I went out and bought a packet of butter,\
  \ and I hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to take me to somewhere I might hear\
  \ a lot of clatter. He took me\u2014grindingly slowly through the congested streets!\u2014\
  to a lane alongside a railway shunting yard. The sound was more akin to din than\
  \ to mellifluous clatter, but he had done his best, and I gave him a generous tip.\
  \ There was a low wall on the lane, bordering a flowerbed violent with lupins, and\
  \ I sat upon it, clutching the butter, content to pass the time. I suppose there\
  \ was a nagging hope that a portal would open up before me, or an emissary from\
  \ that remote and lovely land suddenly materialise before me, or spring out from\
  \ behind the lupins, and take my hand and guide me. But nothing whatsoever happened,\
  \ save that along the lane came passing an off-duty maitre d\u2019, one who had\
  \ expelled me from his pantry a few days before, and he recognised me, and cursed\
  \ me as he passed, and threatened to call the police, though I was doing nothing\
  \ wrong. I made a gift to him of the packet of butter, as a peace offering, and\
  \ he relented, and sat down on the wall next to me, and we fell into amicable conversation.\n\
  \u201CHave you heard tell,\u201D I asked, \u201COf a remote and lovely land, in\
  \ another time, whether past or future I do not know, where the butter is golden\
  \ and the clatter is mellifluous and the taxis careen along the wide important boulevards?\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhy yes!\u201D he cried, \u201COnly the other evening in the restaurant\
  \ there was a group at one of the tables who spoke of such things.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Did you ask them how they got there, via a portal perhaps, or by magic bus etcetera?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI did not. As maitre d\u2019, I spoke to them only of food and drink and\
  \ service standards. In any case, I did not need to ask, for I already know the\
  \ answer. It is a land I have visited many times myself. In fact I am on my way\
  \ there now.\u201D\nMy eyes popped out of my head.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I said, \u201C\
  I knew I would be on to something by buying a packet of butter and taking a taxi\
  \ to a place of clatter! Can I come with you?\u201D\n\u201COf course you cannot,\u201D\
  \ he replied, and he stood up and turned about, twice, thrice, and vanished behind\
  \ the lupins. I sprang after him, and tripped over, and lay sprawled in the flowerbed\
  \ with my mouth full of mud. And then a wind came in from the west, a roaring wind\
  \ so loud that it drowned out the clatter from the shunting yard. I had given my\
  \ butter away, and the taxi was gone. I got up and dusted myself down and trudged\
  \ home. The evening newspaper was on the doormat. A huge headline shrieked the news\
  \ that, far away in Dallas, Texas, President Oswald had been shot.\n[2012-07-14]"
