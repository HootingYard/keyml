text: "\u201CIt seems also not very easie, for a Man in his Sermon to learn his Parishioners\
  \ how to dissolve Gold; of what, and how the stuff is made. Now, to ring the Bells,\
  \ and call the People on purpose together, would be but a blunt business; but to\
  \ do it neatly, and when no Body look'd for it, that's the rarity and art of it.\
  \ Suppose, then, that he takes for his text that of St. Matthew, Repent ye, for\
  \ the Kingdom of God is at hand. Now tell me, Sir, do you not perceive the Gold\
  \ to be in a dismal fear, to curl and quiver at the first reading of these words.\
  \ It must come in thus: The blotts and blurrs of our sins must be taken out by the\
  \ Aqua-fortis of our Tears; to which Aqua-fortis if you put a fifth part of Sal-Amoniack,\
  \ and set them in a gentle heat, it makes Aqua-Regia, which dissolves Gold. And\
  \ now 'tis out. Wonderfull are the things that are to be done by the help of metaphors\
  \ and similitudes! And I'll undertake, that with a little more pains and consideration,\
  \ out of the very same words, he could have taught the People how to make Custards,\
  \ Marmalade, or to stew Prunes.\u201D\nJohn Eachard, The Grounds And Occasions Of\
  \ The Contempt Of The Clergy And Religion (1670)\n[2010-09-11]"
