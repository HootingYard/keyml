text: "For reasons both bewildering and unfathomable, Hooting Yard has occasionally\
  \ ended up in lists of tiptop blogs perused by those of a Liberal Democrat persuasion.\
  \ Partly by way of these perplexing bedfellows, I happened upon a postage called\
  \ Eight years in eight posts\u2014where Jonathan Calder, following the lead of some\
  \ others, took a look back at what he was writing on more or less the same date\
  \ during the past eight years. So I thought it might be instructive and diverting\
  \ to do the same. There was a time, regrettably, when Hooting Yard was not the Indefatigable\
  \ Daily it has become, so where there was no postage for 16 May I have taken something\
  \ from as close to the date as I could.\nLast year, on 16 May 2011, I linked to\
  \ a piece in The Dabbler about James Joyce's Ulysses. This gave me the excuse to\
  \ retail for the umpteenth time a couple of contemporary reviews of the novel and\
  \ other Joycean bittybobs.\nOn 16 May 2010, The Bats Of Remorse included the phrase\
  \ \u201Cthe porale of grief\u201D. \u201CPorale\u201D is a splendid and too rarely\
  \ deployed word.\nOn 18 May 2009 I revealed the four categories of reader defined\
  \ by an eighteenth-century subscription library.\n16 May 2008 was the occasion for\
  \ an illustration depicting sphairistike as played in the year 2000.\nAnother illustration\
  \ on 16 May 2007, which I like so much I shall reproduce it here. We have, of course,\
  \ seen further references to Chutney On My Spats in recent days.\n\nWe now revert\
  \ to the old Hooting Yard format, where 14 May 2006 included a quotation from Bachelor\
  \ Bluff\_: His Opinions, Sentiments, And Disputations by Oliver Bell Bunce (1881).\n\
  On 24 May 2005, learn why you will be disappointed should you wish to know How Cats\
  \ Spend Their Time.\nAnd on 17 May 2004, The Life And Loves Of The Immersion Man,\
  \ one of the first pieces I ever read on Resonance104.4FM, on a Clear Spot programme\
  \ in 2002, before the advent of Hooting Yard On The Air.\nNOTE\_: The links to Old\
  \ Format Hooting Yard seem to go somewhat astray. You might have to scroll up or\
  \ down a tad to find precisely what I intend you to find.\n[2012-05-16]"
