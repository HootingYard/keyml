text: "Discouraging news reaches me about Dennis Beerpint. The weedy poet has, it\
  \ seems, cast off his beatnik persona. In an interview with the magazine Ex-Beatnik\
  \ Poets Speak Out! he says:\n\u201CPeople will accuse me of selling out, but quite\
  \ frankly I am sick and tired of sticking it to The Man, you dig? There's no money\
  \ in it. I want to be a people's poet, like Carol Ann Duffy or Ian McMillan, but\
  \ I am neither the Poet Laureate nor an irritating professional northerner. So when\
  \ the Co-op offered me the position of surrealist-in-residence, I jumped at the\
  \ chance.\u201D\n\u201CSurreal\u201D is a much-abused word these days, but it is\
  \ surely appropriate to describe Beerpint's first effort on the Co-op's behalf.\
  \ He was asked to add an intriguingly madcap line to the allergy advice on their\
  \ jam doughnuts, and came up with this corker:\nThese products have been prepared\
  \ in an area that handles the following ingredients: Celery, Crustaceans, Fish,\
  \ Lupins and Molluscs.\nClearly, though he may indeed have \u201Csold out\u201D\
  , Dennis Beerpint has not lost his mojo.\nNOTE\_: Many thanks to Gaw for drawing\
  \ this to my attention.\n[2010-07-29]"
