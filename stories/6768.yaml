text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I pose a tricky problem one might encounter in the\
  \ game of Spite, or Lantern Jaw as it is known in some circles. Amateurs ought not\
  \ to be intimidated by the seemingly \u201Cexpert\u201D solutions posited in the\
  \ Comments, all of which so far\u2014to my eye, at least\u2014have the fatal flaw\
  \ of mistaking Spite for a card game. A simple enough error, I suppose, considering\
  \ that the symbols\n\nare employed, but any truly experienced Spiteologist will\
  \ know that these denote something wholly different from the hearts and clubs and\
  \ diamonds and spades of the standard card game, so different indeed that to gain\
  \ a full understanding one needs to have one's brain artificially modified by the\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmann Procedure, from whence there is no turning back. It is true that\
  \ everyday life can become somewhat problematic after the modification, but the\
  \ benefits to one's Spite skills are immense and glorious and majestic, so only\
  \ a pipsqueak would dare to complain or, ruinously, to pursue Bl\xF6tzmann through\
  \ the courts.\n[2011-06-24]"
