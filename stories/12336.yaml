text: "Earlier today I had an errand to do which involved taking a rather large sum\
  \ of cash to the bank. (My idea of what constitutes a \u201Clarge sum\u201D may\
  \ not be yours.) Pansy Cradledew fretted that I might be waylaid by malefactors\
  \ and ne'er-do-wells, so when I got back\u2014safe and sound\u2014I sent her a reassuring\
  \ message. I swear on my mother's life* that every word of this is true.\nJust a\
  \ note to let you know that as I was leaving the bank, several chaps in stocking\
  \ masks burst in waving firearms and shouting at everyone to get on the floor. I\
  \ executed a quick tableau vivant of a scene from Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988),\
  \ and the villains were so awestruck by the verisimilitude of my pose that they\
  \ were stunned, staring goggle-eyed and dropping their guns. After that it was a\
  \ simple enough matter to summon Detective Captain Cargpan and his rufty tufty henchmen,\
  \ who placed them under arrest while I sashayed off to catch the bus.\n*NOTA BENE\_\
  : Ms Cradledew has asked me to point out that my mother died twenty years ago, a\
  \ fact which she says utterly invalidates my swearage. That may well be so, but\
  \ I know my onions.\n[2014-01-27]"
