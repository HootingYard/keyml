  Dear Mr Key, Are you still alive?

  Dear Mr Key, Has your pea-sized yet pulsating brain finally given up the ghost?

  Ahoy there Key!, Is there a terrible vacancy between your ears we devoted readers
  ought to know about?

  These are just some of the letters I have received in response to the eerie silence
  which has fallen over Hooting Yard like a leaden pall. The awful truth is revealed
  in today''s Dabbler, and it is all about bees!
