  David Tuffley.\nIs this a blindingly obvious truth? Or is it arrant nonsense? It\
  \ has a certain Radio 4 Today programme \u201CThought For The Day\u201D ring to\
  \ it, but actually it comes from a po-faced dissection of Bob Dylan's Desolation\
  \ Row, to which Mick Hartley links.\nMr Hartley thinks Mr Tuffley, of Redland Bay,\
  \ Australia, is talking twaddle, but I'm not so sure. For one thing, Mr Tuffley's\
  \ location suggests he lives next to the sea, and thus may from time to time have\
  \ seen, conversed with, or otherwise had traffick with mermaids. As far as I can\
  \ ascertain, Mr Hartley is a Londoner, and thus is unlikely to be familiar with\
  \ such semiaquatic beings, other than at those times they splash and cavort in the\
  \ Thames.\nI note that Harriet Harman's latest Equalities Bill has not a jot to\
  \ say about mermaids, and this may indeed have led to a justified sense of grievance,\
  \ even of victimhood. But for the time being I shall reserve judgment. I plan to\
  \ view footage of marches and demonstrations, seeing if I can spot any mermaids\
  \ among the more common students, crusties, and beardy higher education lecturers.\
  \ I shall report back when my researches are at an end. Ah, but when is research\
  \ ever at an end?\n[2009-05-06]"
