text: "In spite of the example set by my older siblings, I was, as a child, reluctant\
  \ to join an organised group such as the Boy Scouts or the Woodcraft Folk or the\
  \ Young Pioneers or the Kibbo Kift. I kept myself to myself, content to lollop about\
  \ in self-imposed solitude. All that changed, however, on the day when I was eight\
  \ years old and I received an invitation to join Peewit Patrol.\nI had never heard\
  \ of this little fraternity, so I was intrigued. Intriguing, too, was the invitation\
  \ itself, which was delivered to my bedroom windowsill in the beak of a bird I supposed\
  \ was a peewit. It took the form of a folded sheet of paper which, when extracted\
  \ from the bird's beak and unfolded, revealed a message which looked as if it had\
  \ been scribbled in blood. \u201CCome to the spinney at midnight,\u201D it read,\
  \ \u201CWhere you will be initiated into Peewit Patrol\u201D. It was unsigned.\n\
  That night, I went up to bed at my usual time and pretended to be asleep. Excited\
  \ and alert, I listened out for the sounds of my siblings and parents retiring for\
  \ the night. When all was still, I crept out of bed, fashioned a rope ladder from\
  \ my bedsheets, and let myself out through the window. The spinney was out on the\
  \ edge of our bucolic\u2014our idyllic\u2014village, and I ran like the clappers\
  \ to get there before midnight struck.\nI was puffed out when I arrived, and for\
  \ a moment I thought someone had played a trick on me, as the spinney seemed to\
  \ be deserted. But then, one by one, from behind clumps of trees, appeared several\
  \ children, a dozen or so. At least, I thought they were children, they were all\
  \ about my size, but I did not recognise any of them because their faces were concealed.\
  \ Each wore a painted\_papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 helmet in the shape of a peewit's head,\
  \ roughly double the size of their own heads. From the neck down, they were dressed\
  \ conventionally, save for a tabard and a sash. I gawped.\nOne now stepped forward\
  \ and greeted me. He explained that I was to be initiated into Peewit Patrol, a\
  \ great honour, but one which I must keep secret. A bonfire was lit, and the children\
  \ began to prance and caper in a circle around it, uttering shrill cries which may\
  \ have been imitative of a peewit's call. I was taken by the hand and pulled into\
  \ the ring and did my best to prance and caper and shriek like the others. When\
  \ we were all at the point of exhaustion, at a signal we stopped still. The circle\
  \ regrouped, with me now at the centre.\nThe child\u2014if it was a child\u2014\
  who had first greeted me now made a long and frankly incoherent announcement. The\
  \ gist of it, I was able to gather, was that I was to be welcomed into the fraternity\
  \ of Peewit Patrol and I must swear to serve it with all my gumption. A bumper bottle\
  \ of Squelcho!\u2014a sort of fizzy pop\u2014was opened and passed around, and each\
  \ one took a swig before it was passed to me. I swigged, and swore. And then the\
  \ tabard and the sash were draped over me, and the painted papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 peewit\
  \ helmet was placed upon my head. I was a member of Peewit Patrol!\nAnd there and\
  \ then I set off on my first patrol of the village perimeter, in the moonlight,\
  \ sworn to protect the village from harm. We were each armed with a stick gathered\
  \ from the spinney floor, and we marched slowly, keeping a watchful lookout through\
  \ the apertures in our helmets. Occasionally one or other of my companions would\
  \ make the shrill peewit cry.\nIt was an exquisite thrill for me, who had been so\
  \ solitary, to feel a sense of belonging\u2014belonging to a secret, illicit band,\
  \ but one which acted for the good of the village, unknown to the adult villagers.\
  \ And the thrill was never more exquisite than on those nights when we came upon\
  \ a vagrant or a beggar or somebody who looked a bit funny, and we swooped down\
  \ upon them in a terrible flock, beating them savagely with our sticks, and, when\
  \ they were crumpled and helpless on the ground, we fell upon them, pecking at them\
  \ in a frenzy with the razorblades embedded in our papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 beaks, saving\
  \ the village from outsiders who would do us harm. Happy days!\n[2015-01-05]"
