text: "I am a devotee of the ludicrous yet brilliant television series Lost. This\
  \ surprises some readers, not least because it is of course a blatant plagiarism\
  \ of the Hooting Yard serial story Blodgett And His Pals Hanging Around On A Mysterious\
  \ Island After Surviving A Plane Crash, episodes of which appeared here back in\
  \ December 2005 and January 2006. But I forgive the writers and producers of the\
  \ American series, because I am like as unto a saint and martyr.\nOne of the features\
  \ of the show that has always appealed to me is the manner in which certain characters\
  \ are named after great thinkers of the past. Rousseau, John Locke, Jeremy Bentham\
  \ and Mikhail Bakunin all appear in the Lost scripts, and there may be others I\
  \ have forgotten for the moment. Early on, I assumed the significance of these dubbings\
  \ would become apparent, until at last it dawned on me that they are, though deliberately\
  \ chosen, purely arbitrary. A programme such as Lost encourages fervent babble in\
  \ online fora and discussion groups, where airheads expound and exchange their theories\
  \ about this or that clump of minutiae, and clearly these names are planted, like\
  \ the books characters are seen reading, as fodder for the nutters. I must add that\
  \ despite my enthusiasm for the show, I do not waste precious hours reading or contributing\
  \ to the online drivel.\nThe point of noting this is that it has only belatedly\
  \ occurred to me what a tremendous fictional device it is. I am minded to write\
  \ stories featuring protagonists called Charles Lindbergh or John Ruskin or Tallulah\
  \ Bankhead or Hazel Blears, where no reference is remotely intended to their famous\
  \ living, or dead, or brain-dead, counterparts. Expect passages such as the one\
  \ below to turn up at the Yard soon:\n\u201CSo, Ringo Starr, you continue to defy\
  \ me?\u201D hissed evil Nazi Obergruppenfuhrer Blind Jack of Knaresborough to his\
  \ quailing captive. Suddenly, a rescue party led by daring trio Nova Pilbeam, Ivy\
  \ Compton-Burnett, and Thomas De Quincey crashed in to the chamber. The Nazi hellhound\
  \ spun on his heels, but was swiftly grappled to the floor by David Miliband.\n\
  Later, as the gung ho heroes sat in the helicopter taking them back to Blighty,\
  \ they were moved to receive congratulatory radio messages from both Richard Milhous\
  \ Nixon and Ayn Rand.\n[2009-06-26]"
