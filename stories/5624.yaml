text: "\u201COi, Key! Where's the blinkin\u2019 prose?\u201D shouts a gruff and guttural\
  \ voice inside my skull, in a dream or nightmare. It's a good question, however\
  \ impolitely put. I can't plead that my brain is empty, for the usual shenanigans\
  \ are going on in there, the witterings and sparks. But for some reason, over the\
  \ past few weeks, when my fingertips get set to tippy-tap at the qwerty, something\
  \ seizes up, and I stare out of the window or light a cigarette or pick up a book\
  \ and bury my head in it. (I haven't been keeping up with the usual blogs I read,\
  \ either.) Perhaps, with Impugned By A Peasant & Other Stories unleashed upon a\
  \ palpitating world, I am drawn to paper, not to screen. Yet all the words begin\
  \ upon the screen, and have done for the last decade and a half at least. I can't\
  \ quite recall when I last saw the typewriter I used to own, and upon which I typed\
  \ out, on paper, and with much use of Tippex, the first few Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press pamphlets. What became of it, that Olivetti, first acquired by my family\
  \ when I was nine or ten, and on which I tapped out such juvenilia as a magazine\
  \ devoted to the very sensible hobby of nisbet spotting? (How I wish I still had\
  \ the five or six issues of that important journal! Too late now for them to be\
  \ found in a skip, or at the bottom of an abandoned mineshaft\u2014they will have\
  \ rotted long ago.) Had I been born a generation later, of course, all that nisbet\
  \ spotting stuff would have been online, imperishable. I don't remember much about\
  \ it, save that I invented a cast of characters who formed a nisbet spotting club,\
  \ and who never actually spotted any nisbets. For some unearthly reason the HQ was\
  \ placed, very firmly, in Biggleswade, a town I have never knowingly visited. Ah,\
  \ the fripperies of youth! Not entirely different, in many ways, from the fripperies\
  \ of my Hooting Yard-based adulthood, and impending dotage.\nI was going to write\
  \ something about pipe-smoking, not that I have ever smoked a pipe. There was something\
  \ I read, or saw, on pipes, that made me want to write\u2026 but what it was, I\
  \ cannot say, it's gone, it's gone\u2026\nForthcoming\_: Huz and Buz. Soon.\n[2010-12-01]"
