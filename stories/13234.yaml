  \ Clare and I would present our double act on literary nonsense to the sixth-formers\
  \ of Truro School. (A riveting account of an earlier appearance at Bristol Grammar\
  \ School can be found here.) A scheduling mixup hoo-hah meant, however, that instead\
  \ of descending upon the not-so-tinies in tandem, Roland and I did our bits separately,\
  \ on successive days. Improvising brilliantly. Mr Clare inserted into his presentation\
  \ an old Hooting Yard On The Air recording, so my disembodied voice provided a foretaste\
  \ of what had of necessity become the next day's entertainment. The piece he chose\
  \ was, appropriately, devoted to the subject of an unsuccessful educational initiative\
  \ in Cornwall. It first appeared in Hooting Yard on 30 March 2006. Here it is again:\n\
  Dear Mr Key, writes Octavia Funnel, I am sure I read somewhere that Dobson's companion\
  \ and amanuensis, Marigold Chew, was a feral child, like the Wild Boy of Aveyron\
  \ or Kaspar Hauser*. Is this true?\nI think I can help Ms Funnel out here. She is\
  \ clearly unfamiliar with Dobson's rare and out of print pamphlet Ten Things Guaranteed\
  \ To Drive Marigold Chew Crackers, an amusing bagatelle which he wrote for Marigold's\
  \ birthday one year. It is worth quoting at length:\n\nLeft, the Wild Boy of Aveyron.\
  \ Right, Kaspar Hauser\nThere can be no doubt about number one on the list of things\
  \ that drive Marigold Chew crackers. Countless are the times I have witnessed her\
  \ seething with fury when she is mistaken for Mary Goldchew, the so-called Savage\
  \ Infant of Splat.\nSplat is a tiny, stricken village in Cornwall, and it was here,\
  \ on a muggy summer's day in 19\u2013, that a peasant pushing his barrow of countryside\
  \ filth along a lane was astonished to encounter a small child roaring and spitting\
  \ and growling and scrabbling in the muck. Its gender was indeterminate, but its\
  \ savagery was unquestionable.\nThe peasant, sad to say, had the morals of the gutter\
  \ and a heart as foul as a swamp, and he decided then and there to sell the child\
  \ to a travelling circus or a zoo. Plucking the child from its ditch, he shoved\
  \ her on to his barrow and trundled off towards a larger town where mountebanks\
  \ were known to gather. But the child, bestial being that she was, sank her teeth\
  \ into the peasant's wrist and attacked him in a whirling frenzy of bloodlust. She\
  \ was gnawing the hair off his head when a kindly doctor arrived on the scene. He\
  \ patted her on the head and announced, \u201CThere, there, little one, be not afraid.\
  \ I am a kindly doctor fascinated by Natural Philosophy, and I shall take you to\
  \ my comfortable house and see if, over a period of months, or years, I can instil\
  \ in you the civilised qualities that were your birthright but have been stolen\
  \ from you by no doubt tragic circumstances. What is your name?\u201D\nThe child\
  \ howled.\n\u201CAh,\u201D said the kindly doctor, \u201CYou are inarticulate. That\
  \ noise you made sounded to me like a combination of a wolf and a bear, with perhaps\
  \ a touch of corncrake. I deduce that you have been raised since you were a baby\
  \ by wolves and bears and corncrakes, and mayhap by bees and hornets too. Still,\
  \ you must have a name, child, so I shall call you Mary.\u201D\nDoctor Goldchew\
  \ took the child by the hand and led her to his house, which stood all alone in\
  \ a field outside Splat. There, he dunked her in a disinfectant bath, dressed her\
  \ in girly clothes, and embarked on a comprehensive pedagogical regime. Over the\
  \ following weeks, he attempted to teach her metaphysics, arithmetic, rhetoric,\
  \ logic, Latin, Greek, bread baking, botany, chemistry, religious instruction, conspiracy\
  \ theory, merchant banking, astronomy, philology, and the rudiments of table tennis,\
  \ or ping pong. During this time reporters from the Splat Courier & Bugle camped\
  \ out on his doorstep, filing a series of woefully inaccurate stories about the\
  \ girl they called the Savage Infant of Splat. Her fame spread throughout Europe,\
  \ and Doctor Goldchew received visits from some of the most distinguished intellectuals\
  \ of the day, including Kapisko, Blunkett, and Woobie. It was the latter who persuaded\
  \ the kindly doctor to have the girl baptised by being fully submerged in the sea\
  \ off the coast of Cornwall, during which baptism she nearly drowned.\nShe entered\
  \ the booming ocean a savage infant, biting and squealing and howling, wrote the\
  \ doctor, and she emerged as Mary Goldchew, a pious Christian child.\nThis is a\
  \ selective account, of course. The doctor makes no mention of the drenched and\
  \ spluttering tot who was fished out of the water by a passing trawler. Nor does\
  \ he admit that the \u201Cpious Christian child\u201D remained incorrigibly savage\
  \ for the rest of her long, long life. In spite of the doctor's lessons\u2014to\
  \ which he soon added physics, geology, alchemy, polevaulting, palaentology, entomology,\
  \ knitting, forensic medicine, vexillology, Dianetics and pottery\u2014the Savage\
  \ Infant of Splat became a Savage Adolescent and in turn a Savage Adult. She celebrated\
  \ her twenty-sixth birthday by creeping into Doctor Goldchew's bedroom as he slept\
  \ and smothering him with a pillow.\nThereafter she spent her days crashing around\
  \ like a wild maniac as the once comfortable Splat house fell into ruin about her.\
  \ When she died, craggy and ancient, decades later, she had learned nothing\u2014\
  nothing except to speak two words, the same two words that were the full extent\
  \ of the Wild Boy of Aveyron's vocabulary: God and milk.\n*NOTA BENE\_: Specialists\
  \ in the field would dub Kaspar Hauser a \u201Cconfined\u201D rather than \u201C\
  feral\u201D child.\n[2014-09-29]"
