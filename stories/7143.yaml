text: "\nThis is the cover of Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning. It was\
  \ published in an edition of twenty-five copies in 1994, under the Hooting Yard\
  \ Press imprint and\u2014save for a brief, rewritten, extract posted here some years\
  \ ago\u2014has never again seen the light of day. It was the last piece of prose\
  \ I completed before my descent into the maelstrom, or the Wilderness Years, or\
  \ whatever one wants to call that period of ruination from which I eventually emerged\
  \ with the launch of the Hooting Yard website in 2003.\nI am planning to republish\
  \ Obsequies, with the original text unaltered, as the second volume in the Out Of\
  \ Print Pamphlets Reprinted series, later this year. Meanwhile, I have decided to\
  \ read the whole thing on the radio, starting with this evening's episode of Hooting\
  \ Yard On The Air on Resonance104.4FM, continuing next week, and possibly the week\
  \ after. (I'm not sure how long it will take.)\nTurn on, tune in, pin back your\
  \ ears, and listen.\n[2011-08-18]"
