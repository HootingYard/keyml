text: "The diary of Robert Falcon Scott on this day in 1912:\n\nCamp 68. Height 9,760.\
  \ T. -23.5\xB0. The worst has happened, or nearly the worst. We marched well in\
  \ the morning and covered seven and a half miles. Noon sight showed us in Lat. 89\xB0\
  \ 42\u2032 S., and we started off in high spirits in the afternoon, feeling that\
  \ tomorrow would see us at our destination. About the second hour of the march Bowers\u2019\
  \ sharp eyes detected what he thought was a cairn; he was uneasy about it, but argued\
  \ that it must be a sastrugus. Half an hour later he detected a black speck ahead.\
  \ Soon we knew this could not be a natural snow feature. We marched on, found that\
  \ it was a black flag tied to a sledge bearer; near by the remains of a camp; sledge\
  \ tracks and ski tracks going and coming and the clear trace of dogs; paws\u2014\
  many dogs. This told us the whole story. The Norwegians have forestalled us and\
  \ are first at the Pole. It is a terrible disappointment, and I am very sorry for\
  \ my loyal companions. Many thoughts come and much discussion have we had. Tomorrow\
  \ we must march on to the Pole and then hasten home with all the speed we can compass.\
  \ All the day-dreams must go; it will be a wearisome return.\n[2013-01-16]"
