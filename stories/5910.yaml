text: "Courtesy of The Cat's Meat Shop, some extremely detailed advice on grunting:\n\
  Take the baby hand in one of yours. Spread out the hand. Point to the thumb, and\
  \ say decidedly, yet confidingly \u2013\n1. This little pig went to market.\u201D\
  \ (Grunt and let it be an ordinary pig's grunt.)\nPoint to the next finger and say,\
  \ in the deepest bass you can assume \u2013\n2. \u201CThis little pig stayed at\
  \ home.\u201D (Give a morose bass grunt and frown.)\nPoint to the next finger and\
  \ say, with an insinuating tone and smile, elevating your eyebrows and bowing \u2013\
  \n3. \u201CThis little pig had roast beef\u201D (and add three quick little grunts\
  \ of satisfaction.)\nPoint to the next finger and say, in a voice just ready to\
  \ cry \u2013\n4. \u201CThis little pig had none.\u201D (Give two low grunts of weariness,\
  \ and look ready to cry.)\nThen pointing to the little finger, say very pleasantly,\
  \ in a shrill, droll voice, laughing meanwhile, \u201CThis little pig cried, \u2018\
  Tweak! tweak! tweak!'\u201D pinching and twirling the child's finger gently, as\
  \ if you had hold of the pig's tail.\nThis makes a complete harmless drama of the\
  \ story of the pigs, and rouses baby's feelings, sensations and ideas in a healthy\
  \ manner. Five distinct emotions are raised: 1. Interest; 2. Fear; 3. Pleasure or\
  \ sympathy; 4. Grief, almost to tears; 5. A sudden reversion to mirth, and \u201C\
  All's well that ends well,\u201D a great desideratum in baby estimation. We must\
  \ remember too, that the feelings during babyhood are ephemeral in the extreme,\
  \ light and evanescent\u2026.\n[2011-01-25]"
