text: "When the first babblings of Hooting Yard On The Air were heard across the aether\
  \ almost five years ago, there was different theme music every week. After a while,\
  \ a panel of experts settled on Caucasian Lullaby by Slapp Happy & Henry Cow to\
  \ be the definitive theme and so it has remained to this day.\nMindful of the fact\
  \ that this coming April will see the fifth anniversary of the show, Mr Key has\
  \ been pondering whether or not to cast tradition aside, in a fit of what may be\
  \ petulance, and to choose something different to begin the show and to play during\
  \ those intervals when he stops reading to drink tea or to have a choking spasm.\
  \ Incapable of making a decision, he is seeking the views of listeners. Please use\
  \ the Comments here to \u201Chave your say\u201D, as they say, even if\u2014or especially\
  \ if\u2014you are someone who has never commented at Hooting Yard before. Those\
  \ in favour of a change may wish to suggest an apt piece of music, although Mr Key\
  \ cannot guarantee he will take the slightest bit of notice.\nWhatever the final\
  \ decision may be, every listener really ought to ensure that they are in possession\
  \ of their own copy of Desperate Straights, the album from which Caucasian Lullaby\
  \ is taken, and which is a unique masterpiece. Please purchase it directly from\
  \ the ReR Megacorp, by clicking here. Now.\n\n[2009-02-03]"
