text: "Where are the snows of yesteryear?\n  They have been shovelled into a refrigerated\
  \ container and ferried to a remote storage facility, also refrigerated, where they\
  \ are kept in specially-designed \u201Csnow bins\u201D.\nHow can I gain access to\
  \ the storage facility?\n  With difficulty. As stated, it is remote.\nAssuming for\
  \ the moment that I have at my disposal a tremendous form of transport that could\
  \ zoom me to the remotest parts of the earth in a matter of minutes, in which direction\
  \ should I point it before depressing the big knob with \u201CGo!\u201D etched upon\
  \ it?\n  You do not actually have such a form of transport, do you?\nWell, no, but\
  \ let's just say that I did.\n  Your direction of travel would depend upon where\
  \ you are starting from.\nI am in Pointy Town.\n  There is plenty of snow in Pointy\
  \ Town. Each winter it settles on the pointiest bits of town and remains there,\
  \ cold and white and frozen, until the chirruping of little birdies in the springtime.\
  \ Why in heaven's name would you need access to the snow bins in the remote storage\
  \ facility?\nWhim.\n  Whim?\nIf whim is not a good enough reason, then let us say\
  \ I have been appointed by the burghers of Pointy Town to compare our own snow with\
  \ the snows of yesteryear, and to make my report accordingly.\n  These burghers,\
  \ are they in their right minds?\nThat is a moot point. I know one of them suffered\
  \ a bash on the bonce with a snow-shovel last winter and has not been quite the\
  \ same since. He jabbers and drools and drools and jabbers, turn and turn about.\n\
  \  And was it this particular burgher who commissioned you to examine the snows\
  \ of yesteryear?\nYes, it was.\n  Did you not stop to consider that any comparison\
  \ you made between the snow currently enveloping Pointy Town and the snows of yesteryear\
  \ would be futile?\nThey josh that my middle name is Futility.\n  So you are the\
  \ go-to guy for fool's errands?\nI live in a Paradise of Fools.\n  I thought you\
  \ said you lived in Pointy Town? Are you trying to pull the wool over my eye?\n\
  Do you mean eyes?\n  No, eye. I am Cyclopean.\nA Cyclopean janitor of snow bins?\n\
  \  Yes.\nAh, I read about you in The Cyclopean Janitor of Snow Bins, a bestselling\
  \ blockbuster paperback by Pebblehead!\n  In which, I have to say, I was wholly\
  \ misrepresented, so much so that I have taken legal action with a view to having\
  \ the entire run of several million copies pulped.\nIf you succeed, what will you\
  \ do with all that pulp?\n  I will shovel it into an unrefrigerated container and\
  \ ferry it to a remote storage facility, also unrefrigerated, and keep it in specially-designed\
  \ \u201Cpulp bins\u201D.\nWould that be the same remote storage facility where you\
  \ keep the snows of yesteryear?\n  No, the one is refrigerated and the other not.\n\
  So you would need to be in two places at once to perform your janitorial duties?\n\
  \  No, I would employ a Cyclopean pulp bin janitor.\nIf I pluck out one of mine\
  \ eyes, could I have the job?\n  There is a waiting list of applicants.\nHow could\
  \ I shove myself to the front of that list?\n  With sharp elbows.\nConsider them\
  \ sharpened!\n  Welcome aboard.\n[2014-08-26]"
