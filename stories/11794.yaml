text: "News comes in that the entire western half of the United States has been shut\
  \ down due to the presence in Los Angeles of a plague-infected squirrel. Something\
  \ along those lines, anyway. While I do a spot of fact-checking to ensure I haven't\
  \ exaggerated the threat, it seems apposite to repost this piece from nine long\
  \ years ago.\nDobson was afraid of squirrels. Here's why. It was a damp and ruinous\
  \ Thursday and he had not had any breakfast. He slapped his hand on the table and\
  \ shouted \u201CI must have marmalade! I must have some marmalade!\u201D There was\
  \ nobody to hear his complaint except for an ant which was making its way across\
  \ the floor of his hovel, and the ant didn't care, being an insect. Dobson had not\
  \ even noticed the ant, in any case. He leapt out of his chair, put on his big reindeer-hide\
  \ anorak brought back from one of his Arctic expeditions, and trudged outside, muttering\
  \ now instead of shouting.\nHave I ever told you there were several important trees\
  \ on the path outside Dobson's door? There was a sycamore and a yew, a larch and\
  \ a pine. Dobson was fond of trees, usually, although he was unable to tell the\
  \ difference between them. Gone were the days when he would festoon his hair with\
  \ fallen leaves and twigs, inviting ridicule from the local whippersnappers. Dobson\
  \ in the days of which I write had adopted a sober mien, indeed a gloomy one.\n\u201C\
  Dobson, Dobson, don't look so dismayed,\u201D his acquaintances would say, to which\
  \ the out of print pamphleteer's response was to look heavenward, as if in great\
  \ pain, adopting the air of an early Christian martyr, one lined up for some particularly\
  \ bloodthirsty persecution. Dobson often skimmed through the pages of Foxe's Book\
  \ of Martyrs to pick up tips. But I digress.\nOn this damp marmaladeless morning,\
  \ Dobson walked past the sycamore, the yew, the larch and the pine, onward past\
  \ a repulsive ditch, past the post office and the pig huts and the vipers\u2019\
  \ nest and the glue factory, up the lane towards the Big Unexplained Building On\
  \ The Hill. The wind howled. It always did. Back in the hovel, the ant had vanished\
  \ into a crevice in the wainscot, just as Dobson arrived at the gates of the Building.\
  \ These gates were enormous and forbidding and strange and rusty and locked and\
  \ bolted and unnecessary, for there was a wooden door set in the base and brickish\
  \ wall which skirted the building, and it was only a few feet away to the left of\
  \ the gates, or to the right, I cannot remember precisely, I have never been there\
  \ myself, I am only reporting this as it was told to me by Marigold Chew on the\
  \ day after Dobson's death, after she had had her bath, and was sipping tea from\
  \ an inelegant tin mug in the shabby parlour of a horrible hotel hard by the banks\
  \ of the River Wretched in Sibodnedwabshire.\nDobson knew all about the wooden door,\
  \ so why did he tarry by the strange rusty gates? Was he confused, was his mind\
  \ a jumble due to lack of marmalade? Or did he have a tryst? We do not know. We\
  \ do know that Dobson stood at those gates on that damp Thursday, peering intently\
  \ through them, for a full quarter of an hour before turning around and heading\
  \ off to Old Jack Blothead's Foodstuffs Tent, where he bought a jar of marmalade\
  \ and some pastry and a pot of some kind of edible paste which Old Jack Blothead\
  \ had left unlabelled. The year was 1952. Dobson and the vendor of foodstuffs had\
  \ their usual argument about the pamphleteer's promissory note, a page torn from\
  \ his notebook on which he had scrawled words to the effect that sooner or later\
  \ he would do right by Old Jack Blothead, and if he did not then may the heavens\
  \ smite him and may all his days be leavened with woe. It was advantageous for Dobson\
  \ that Blothead was a man of great charity and puny intellect, and after a few minutes\
  \ he left the tent through its great grimy flaps, armed with his jar and pot and\
  \ a paper bag for the pastry. They would not fit in the single pocket of his anorak,\
  \ so he carried them in his ungloved, unmittened hands.\nWhat pangs led Dobson back\
  \ to the strange enormous rusty gates of the Big Unexplained Building On The Hill?\
  \ There was a fallen log, a log fallen from a trembling poplar, slap bang next to\
  \ the gates, and Dobson sat on it and ate the pastry, and he stayed sitting there\
  \ despite the fact that it began to rain heavily. He didn't even bother to pull\
  \ up the hood of his anorak, although that may be because it was rife with holes\
  \ made by starving moths and his head would have got wet anyway. Wet, but surely\
  \ not as wet as it did get, as he sat on the poplar log in the downpour eating pastry\
  \ with his pot of paste and marmalade jar beside him outside the forbidding and\
  \ strange and rusty and locked and bolted gates of the Big Unexplained Building\
  \ On The Hill on that Thursday morning in 1952 when he first became terrified of\
  \ squirrels.\n\u201CWhy,\u201D I asked Marigold Chew as she sipped her tea in the\
  \ shabby hotel parlour, \u201CWhy did Dobson become so fearful of squirrels on that\
  \ particular day?\u201D She glanced at me briefly, and I was disconcerted by the\
  \ weird look in her eyes. \u201CThose bushy tails\u2026.\u201D she began, then fell\
  \ silent, turning to stare out of the window. I followed her gaze, and saw the gravedigger\
  \ walking across the lawn, toting his spade jauntily over his shoulder. \u201CThose\
  \ bushy, bushy tails\u2026\u201D Marigold Chew repeated. She drank the rest of her\
  \ tea, put the mug down on the floor by her feet, and stood up. \u201CI must go\
  \ and have a few words with the gravedigger,\u201D she said, and swept out of the\
  \ room as breezily as a bereaved woman on crutches can sweep breezily from a hotel\
  \ parlour on the day after the death of her one true friend on this magnificent\
  \ and baffling planet.\n[2013-07-26]"
