  \ gubbins lurking behind the Hooting Yard website, hence this new look. My\u2014\
  and your\u2014thanks are due to the boffin who worked tirelessly to ensure the whole\
  \ thing is still here on the internet. He has now gone away to a foreign land for\
  \ a well-deserved break.\nInevitably, there will be a few teething problems. I noted,\
  \ for example, that the index to the Archives, making them accessible by date and\
  \ topic under the tab above, has vanished. I know that most of you lot spend virtually\
  \ all your waking hours reading, rereading, and rerereading the ten years\u2019\
  \ worth of potsages [sic] gathered here, so until we fix that, upon the boffin's\
  \ return, I suggest you make use of the Search box to rummage around.\nPlease let\
  \ me know of any other blips, bloops, or catastrophic horrors you may spot, and\
  \ we shall endeavour to put things straight.\n[2017-07-21]"
