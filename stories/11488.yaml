text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox is being pursued by tally-ho-ing\
  \ hunters on horseback. It is so quick a fox that it is soon out of sight, having\
  \ scurried under a hedge and leaped over a ditch and away, away! But the lazy dog\
  \ is now sure to be crushed under the hooves of galloping horses unless it moves\
  \ out of their path. It is a dog equivalent of Pearl White, star of the silver screen,\
  \ who sometimes found herself tied to railway lines as huge locomotives thundered\
  \ implacably towards her. Except that no ropes tie the dog down, merely its own\
  \ lassitude.\nThe awful sound of the approaching hooves wakes the lazy dog. It has\
  \ been asleep, dreaming about whatever dogs dream about. It was quite oblivious\
  \ to the quick brown fox which jumped over it at the beginning of our story. Now\
  \ it opens one doggy eye and peers towards the source of the din which has awoken\
  \ it. Shifting its fat bulk oh so slightly on the grass, it lifts one diffident\
  \ paw in a gesture designed to halt the horses in their gallop. Think of a station\
  \ master holding up a flag to halt a train.\nIf this were a transcript of an episode\
  \ of a Pearl White serial, we would end here, leaving you in suspense. But, just\
  \ as the cinematheque audience knows, deep down, that Pearl White will not actually\
  \ be killed under the wheels of the thundering locomotive, so you know, deep down,\
  \ don't you?, that Mr Key would never gratuitously kill a dog. Even a lazy fictional\
  \ dog.\nSo what happens is that, astonishingly, each individual horse spots the\
  \ raised paw of the lazy dog on the lawn, and comes to a jarring stop, in spite\
  \ of the tally-ho-ing promptings of its rider. Indeed, so sudden is the horses\u2019\
  \ halting that some of the hunters are pitched forward and thrown from their mounts.\n\
  The lazy dog goes back to sleep. The toppled hunters rub their sprains and bruises.\
  \ The horses make standard horsey noises and pad about, as horses do, when left\
  \ to their own devices. Far, far away, the quick brown fox is still going like the\
  \ clappers. It is heading towards a railway line.\n[2013-05-29]"
