  \ Then I shall begin.\nOnce upon a time there was a lovely little pony named Popsy.\
  \ Popsy the Pony lived in a meadow splattered with buttercups. It was a lovely meadow.\
  \ The sun was always shining, the weather was always balmy, and the other animals\
  \ in the meadow\u2014birds and insects and burrowing moles\u2014were happy and contented.\
  \ Of course it was a completely artificial and unnatural meadow, quite unlike real\
  \ nature, which is bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying, full of violence\
  \ and pain and death. Just ask a sheep. Sheep know. That is why they barely get\
  \ a wink of sleep, they are so frightened and fretful.\nAnyway, tinies, one day\
  \ Popsy the Pony was having a lovely time in the lovely meadow when, all of a sudden,\
  \ this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of reality \u2026 no, let me\
  \ rephrase that \u2026 this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of the\
  \ hidden, Lovecraftian, true reality beyond our puny human comprehension, and Popsy\
  \ the Pony was slobberingly devoured by an enormous squid from the Black Pit of\
  \ Hellish Nothingness. Slobber slobber slobber! Eek eek eek!\nThe end. Now, tinies,\
  \ you may run away screaming and blubbing like fotherington-tomas.\n[2016-08-31]"
