text: "It is a wonder that, in all the talk of the nation's parlous financial state\
  \ and of the need to reduce the deficit, none of the main\u2014or indeed minor\u2014\
  political parties has suggested one particular way of raising revenue. It has been\
  \ left to economics guru Bingley Swelling to call for a werewolf tax.\nIn a paper\
  \ presented to the Pointy Town Pointyhead think-tank last week, Professor Swelling\
  \ outlined, with bullet points, some of the benefits of such a tax. There were three\
  \ bullet points in total, of gold and silver and bronze, and it should be said that\
  \ they were not made, literally, by firing bullets from a Mannlicher-Carcano sniper's\
  \ rifle \xE0 la Oswald, but represented by puncturing three holes in the Professor's\
  \ cardboard worksheet using a heavy duty hole-punch from Hubermann's stationery\
  \ department. The rim of each hole was then coloured accordingly with lead-based\
  \ gold and silver and bronze paints applied with a long-handled Pastewick brush,\
  \ of weaselhair. Beside the holes, or points, upon his cardboard, Swelling inked\
  \ some text, with a biro, before propping the worksheet on a tubular metal display\
  \ stand, for easy viewing by the think-tankists gathered to hear his\u2026 I was\
  \ going to say \u201Clecture\u201D, but that does not quite give the flavour of\
  \ the Swelling approach.\nNot actually a werewolf himself, the Professor nonetheless\
  \ had the appearance of one. If his yellow, bloodshot eyes, lumbering gait, and\
  \ shocking hairiness were not enough, his speaking voice was akin to a lupine howl,\
  \ whether the moon was full or otherwise. This made it hard to grasp what he was\
  \ saying, hence the pedagogical aid of the cardboard worksheet with its bullet points.\
  \ Thereagain, it would take a mind of infinite subtlety to interpret the hacking\
  \ and stabbing marks made by the Swelling biro. His handwriting was atrocious, though\
  \ in fairness, given the size and shape of his appendages, perhaps one should prefer\
  \ the term paw-writing. Thus the paramount importance of the holes themselves, and\
  \ the colours of their painted rims.\nHere are some notes I took on the occasion.\
  \ I hasten to add that I am not a paid-up Pointy Town Pointyhead, but I know how\
  \ to worm my way into such meetings through bluffery and mesmerism.\n\u201CGold.\
  \ Werewolves often have enormous reserves of wealth in the form of precious stones\
  \ hidden in caves. Sometimes these jewels are embedded in the heads of toads, the\
  \ toads being kept in cages hung from the roofs of the caves. Source\_: The Hidden\
  \ Wealth Of Werewolves by Dobson (out of print).\n\u201CSilver. Impossible to understand\
  \ the first thing about this bullet point, other than the assertion that at least\
  \ twenty billion could be raised \u201Cat a stroke\u201D. But twenty billion what?\n\
  \u201CBronze. Swelling's clincher. A one-off levy, set at a swingeing rate, on all\
  \ werewolves waylaid when attempting to embark on ships sailing across the mighty\
  \ oceans bound for the mythical \u201Cisland o\u2019 werewolves\u201D. Source\_\

  \nUnlike the pointyheads, who were wild-eyed and nodding enthusiastically, I identified\
  \ a number of problems with Professor Swelling's thesis, not least his overreliance\
  \ on out of print pamphlets by Dobson as intellectual ballast. Still, even I have\
  \ to admit that there is much here to chew over, and chew over it I shall, just\
  \ as a werewolf might gnaw one's vitals having sunk its fangs into one's throat,\
  \ out on the moors, on a moonlit night.\n[2010-05-03]"
