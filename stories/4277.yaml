text: "As we have learned, from time to time the so-called \u201Creal world\u201D\
  \ catches up with Hooting Yard in quite charming ways. And what could be more charming,\
  \ and more like something I made up, than the chance to adopt a lobster? I have\
  \ to say I am extremely impressed that the National Lobster Hatchery, which offers\
  \ this splendid opportunity, insists that the first stage of the process is to Name\
  \ Your Lobster. Thus is the act of naming given its proper, paramount importance.\n\
  These conscientious lobsterists at the Hatchery have gone to the trouble of listing\
  \ all their thousands of adopted lobsters, at the point where they are released\
  \ into the wild, and so will your adopted lobster appear on the website when its\
  \ turn comes. Note my assumption that you will be adopting a lobster as soon as\
  \ you have finished reading this. Do not let me down.\nWhile I do not wish to dictate\
  \ in so important a matter as lobster nomenclature, I cannot help thinking that\
  \ it would be a fine thing indeed if the waters around Padstow were to have clacking\
  \ about in them lobsters named after your favourite Hooting Yard characters, such\
  \ as Dobson, Tiny Enid, Old Halob, Dennis Beerpint, Little Severin The Mystic (Badger)\
  \ Lobster, and the rest. Go on, you know it makes sense.\nPlease leave a note in\
  \ the comments when you have named and adopted your lobster.\n\n[2010-04-17]"
