text: "Experience tells us that most cranks hoick their bumf about in carrier bags.\
  \ Any crank's bumf will be peculiar to his own id\xE9e fixe, whether it be UFOs,\
  \ the second coming of Christ, the grassy knoll, or one of any number of tomfooleries.\
  \ But no matter what the precise nature of the mania, the crank almost invariably\
  \ stuffs his bumf into a carrier bag before setting out into the world.\nHaving\
  \ so set out, he makes his way to his preferred spot. This may be, for example,\
  \ at the foot of a statue in an important square. There will be many passers-by,\
  \ weather permitting, each and every one of whom is a potential convert to the crank's\
  \ cause. Bumf in bag, he may either rant through a loudhailer or, more quietly,\
  \ buttonhole individuals by thrusting a sample of his bumf at them as they pass.\n\
  The bumf usually consists of a bundle of Gestetnered screeds, of wild and improbable\
  \ prose, which the crank will be willing to give away gratis. The carrier bag will\
  \ contain numerous copies, often dog-eared and crumpled. Most days, the crank will\
  \ return home with almost as many in his bag as when he set out.\nWhat does he do,\
  \ the crank, when not at his spot? He scribbles a new and more thorough screed,\
  \ sitting at his kitchen table. Each day he gains new insights into his inner world,\
  \ finds fresh evidence for his theory, and he commits it to paper. The best type\
  \ of crank will have in his bumf several different screeds, all of course devoted\
  \ to the same subject.\nIt will be noted the very few cranks ever veer from their\
  \ chosen topic. A Loch Ness Monster crank is oblivious to the concerns of a Lindbergh\
  \ Baby Kidnapping crank. But it is also worth noting that, with the substitution\
  \ of a small number of nouns, the screeds in their bumf can be almost identical.\n\
  It is generally impossible to become an ex-crank. The most a crank can hope for\
  \ is that his mad ideas gain acceptance by the wider world. Then he is no longer\
  \ a crank but a prophet or a visionary. In the future, in recognition, a statue\
  \ of him may be cast, and placed on a plinth in an important square. At the foot\
  \ of the statue, a new crank will take his place, with a carrier bag of bumf, and\
  \ the gleam of certainty in his wild eyes.\n[2014-03-23]"
