text: "Gentlemen, you are now about to embark on a course of studies which will occupy\
  \ you for two years. Together, they form a noble adventure. But I would like to\
  \ remind you of an important point. Some of you, when you go down from the University,\
  \ will go into the Church, or to the Bar, or to the House of Commons, or to the\
  \ Home Civil Service, or to the Indian or Colonial Services, or into various professions.\
  \ Some may go into the Army, some into industry and commerce; some may become country\
  \ gentlemen. A few\u2014I hope a very few\u2014will become teachers or dons. Let\
  \ me make this clear to you. Except for those in the last category, nothing that\
  \ you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible\
  \ use to you in after life\u2014save only this\u2014that if you work hard and intelligently\
  \ you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view,\
  \ is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education.\nJohn Alexander Smith, Waynflete\
  \ Professor of Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy at Oxford, introducing a series\
  \ of lectures in 1914.\n[2012-08-19]"
