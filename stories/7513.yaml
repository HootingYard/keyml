text: "It is a curious fact that whenever I think of the characters who stalked the\
  \ dreams and nightmares of my childhood\u2014Stalin, Lev Yashin, Paavo Nurmi\u2014\
  the one who looms largest and most vividly is the one who never actually existed\
  \ outside my infant imagination. The Breadcrumbs Man was tall and gangly and pale,\
  \ and breadcrumbs were scattered in his hair and in his beard, and upon his coat,\
  \ and the pockets of his coat, they too were crammed with breadcrumbs, and he left\
  \ a trail of breadcrumbs in his wake as he patrolled the streets and alleyways and\
  \ bridges of the ancient city where, in my dreams and nightmares, I grew to manhood.\n\
  He followed me wherever I roamed, through the ancient streets and alleyways and\
  \ across the ancient, crumbling bridges over the river. Sometimes the river sparkled\
  \ in sunlight, but when I climbed down the steps to the mudbanks I saw it was filthy\
  \ and rife with toxic sludge and tiny, wriggling worms. The Breadcrumbs Man followed\
  \ me down the steps to the mudbanks too, and scattered his breadcrumbs upon the\
  \ waters, where they floated, neglected by the worms and any other living things\
  \ that might present themselves, in my sleeping brain, from time to time. There\
  \ were never, I remember, any birds.\nAlways he remained behind me, the Breadcrumbs\
  \ Man, and if I turned to speak with him he stood stock still and averted his gaze,\
  \ shunning me, so the words caught in my throat. But what would I have said?\nWith\
  \ Stalin and Lev Yashin and Paavo Nurmi I would have long and animated discussions,\
  \ about communism and football and long distance running. But I mixed them up, so\
  \ I would talk to Stalin about football, to Lev Yashin about long distance running,\
  \ and to Paavo Nurmi, the only non-communist of the trio, about communism. Sometimes,\
  \ when I woke, I would recall these conversations in great detail, and write accounts\
  \ of them in my jotter, complete with stage directions. I remember thinking that\
  \ one day in years to come I could mould these dialogues into a dramatic presentation\
  \ and take the theatres of the land by storm. And years later, when I had grown\
  \ to manhood, I came upon the jotter one day in a chest stuffed with memorabilia,\
  \ and I read a few pages and I shook my head and guffawed, for it was all nonsense,\
  \ and witless nonsense at that.\nYet the Breadcrumbs Man, who never spoke, and to\
  \ whom I could never utter a word, the Breadcrumbs Man haunts me to this day. He\
  \ no longer appears in my dreams and nightmares, and has not done so since one summer\
  \ afternoon in my early teens. I was at a picnic, in a bright and buttercup-splattered\
  \ field, and, replete with sandwiches and sausages and pastries and pickles, I fell\
  \ into a doze.\nI found myself striding purposefully across the most crumbling and\
  \ ancient of the crumbling and ancient bridges across the river. I sensed that the\
  \ Breadcrumbs Man was following me, and turned my head momentarily to confirm that\
  \ it was so. I quickened my pace. He did likewise. Then we were at the docks. I\
  \ had never visited them before. There were huge tankers and container ships, some\
  \ with the hammer and sickle emblem daubed on their sides, and there were smaller\
  \ boats, fishing smacks and tugs and rowing boats. And, for the first time, there\
  \ were birds! Gulls screeched, guillemots tumbled and swooped, auks and skuas soared.\
  \ I looked behind me. There was the Breadcrumbs Man, somehow paler than ever, almost\
  \ a ghost, and, again for the first time, he looked directly at me. His eyes were\
  \ milky, and blind, and terrible. Suddenly he emptied his pockets of breadcrumbs\
  \ and shook the breadcrumbs from his hair and his beard. The gulls and guillemots\
  \ and auks and skuas descended in a frenzy of scavenge and peck, a blur of birds\
  \ in which the Breadcrumbs Man was engulfed. When the birds flew away, he had vanished.\
  \ I never saw him again.\nIn the bright field, I woke. I cracked open a can of Squelcho!\
  \ and slurped it down. My mother was packing things away in the picnic basket.\n\
  \u201CI am going to be an ornithologist!\u201D I declared.\nI am not an ornithologist.\n\
