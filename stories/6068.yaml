text: "When Sebastian Coe spoke of \u201Cthe greatest tickets on earth\u201D, he was\
  \ talking twaddle, but at least it was amusing twaddle. Too often, the twaddle babbled\
  \ by politicians and others is composed of readymade phrases seemingly used to fill\
  \ time\u2014or, in written form, space\u2014without the inconvenience of thought.\n\
  One practice that has become ubiquitous is an inability to say \u201Cdiverse\u201D\
  \ without immediately adding \u201Cvibrant\u201D. The most recent culprit I noted\
  \ was the cabinet minister Francis Maude, on last week's Question Time. Having told\
  \ us how great it was that the country is \u201Cdiverse\u201D, and not really knowing\
  \ what else he wanted to say, after a very brief pause he added \u201Cand vibrant\u201D\
  , clearly playing for time.\nSimilarly, the front page headline on a recent issue\
  \ of my local council's Pravda-style newspaper was a quote from a resident announcing\
  \ \u201CI love that the borough is so diverse and vibrant\u201D.\nCan one be diverse\
  \ without being vibrant? Or vibrant without being diverse? And, if interrogated,\
  \ chained to a chair in a dank basement, could most of the people trotting out this\
  \ stuff define what they actually mean by \u201Cvibrant\u201D?\nHooting Yard\u2014\
  it's diverse! It vibrates!\n[2011-02-17]"
