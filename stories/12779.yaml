  \ Yard, but that is what has happened. It is a sorry state of affairs and I cannot\
  \ blame it entirely on the aforementioned loss of my mojo. Clearly what is needed\
  \ is for me to PERK UP. To this end, I have been working my way through a self-help\
  \ regime entitled PERKING UP. I will not go into the details of what this consists\
  \ of, as I do not want you lot to be overcome with waves of nausea, spiritual despair,\
  \ and the withers. Suffice to say that I went to the nearest grocery kiosk and obtained\
  \ a supply of plums, and on my way home I walked widdershins around the kirk several\
  \ times. More than that I had best not say, for the time being.\nWhile my PERKING\
  \ UP begins to take hold, there are a couple of small matters to bring to your attention.\
  \ First is the dearth of memorable utterances thus far from the commentators at\
  \ the foopball World Cup. I had hoped to bring you a torrent of inanities, but alas\
  \ there is little to report. Perhaps worth noting was one pundit's observation that\
  \ \u201CHe's a very talented foopballer\u2014he knows where the goal is\u201D. But\
  \ really the tournament has been something of a disappointed to date, with nothing\
  \ to match such past gems as \u201CFor a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle\
  \ who'd just plopped out of the womb\u201D.\nSecond, I am delighted to draw to your\
  \ attention this newly-released podcast from Resonance104.4FM. Originally broadcast\
  \ over two years ago, but none the worse for that.\nKing Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical\
  \ Wiring System, Its Janitor, And Its Chatelaine\n\n[2014-06-23]"
