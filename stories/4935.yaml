text: "Conjure up an image of the ancient world. Do you see a betoga'd fellow beating\
  \ a bird about the bonce with an iron bar? No? Then read your Pliny. Here he is,\
  \ in the Natural History, telling us about parrots:\n\u201CShe hath an head as hard\
  \ as is her beak: when she learns to speak, she must be beaten about the head with\
  \ a rod of yron: for otherwise she careth for no blowes.\u201D\nADDENDUM\_: Pliny's\
  \ seventeenth-century English translator Philomen Holland uses the phrase \u201C\
  barton & mue\u201D for aviary. This is splendid, and I suggest we all take every\
  \ opportunity to resurrect so grievous a loss to the language. You may wish to write\
  \ a note of it in your day-book, particularly if, as Pliny/Holland says elsewhere,\
  \ your \u201Cmemory is so shittle, [you] will soone forget the same againe\u201D\
