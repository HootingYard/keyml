  \ ago it appears that a contraption called the telephone was still in use at Hooting\
  \ Yard, rather than the more familiar, and much groovier, metal tapping machine.]\n\
  Throughout his life, Dobson ignored Christmas, but he loved to celebrate Boxing\
  \ Day. Every year, he made a point of marking the occasion differently. Here is\
  \ his journal entry for one year during the 1950s.\nAh, Boxing Day at last! What\
  \ a glorious day it is. This year there is snow on the ground, robin redbreasts\
  \ hopping about, and Dickensian scenes of wassail and carousing over by the old\
  \ thatched tavern. That being the case, I have nailed fast the shutters and am sitting\
  \ in the gloom. I wired up a microphone next to the indoor wasps\u2019 nest, so\
  \ hectic buzzing drowns out the intolerable sound of carol-singing and suchlike\
  \ torments.\nI breakfasted upon a platter of boiled leeks and steamed viper-heads.\
  \ I will spend much of the day in the kitchen, boiling more leeks and steaming more\
  \ viper-heads for my supper. I had a new telephone installed last week, and I intend\
  \ to take a break from boiling and steaming to call the police. I am going to read\
  \ out my new pamphlet to the desk sergeant, or whoever answers the telephone, for\
  \ it concerns police matters, specifically the legal position regarding the theft\
  \ of leeks from the greengrocers\u2019 and of vipers from the zoo. In the pamphlet,\
  \ which I wrote in pig Latin, just to show off, I make a full confession to having\
  \ used thievery to obtain my Boxing Day foodstuffs, and justify doing so with reference\
  \ to certain historical and/or mythological figures, including Hildegard von Bingen,\
  \ Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and the Warrior King Anaxagrotax. I also make mention\
  \ of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire as a way of throwing the coppers\
  \ off the scent, should they determine to prosecute me.\nAt sixty pages, it may\
  \ take some time to read the complete text to the police officer, so I will attach\
  \ an extension cord to the telephone and drag it into the bathroom, and make my\
  \ call while nestling in a tub of hot milk of magnesia. Over the past year I have\
  \ bought a couple of those little blue-glass bottles every week, and should have\
  \ enough to fill the bath. I will heat the milk of magnesia using Professor Tadaaki's\
  \ Submerged Iron Filament contraption, the label on which claims it can boil a few\
  \ gallons of any known liquid within thirty seconds. Of course, I do not need to\
  \ boil my bath, far from it. Tadaaki does not provide a thermometer, but I have\
  \ one somewhere, in a cupboard, and as soon as I have completed this journal entry\
  \ I shall go in search of it.\nAfter the telephone call, the bath, and my supper,\
  \ I will put the thermometer back in the cupboard and set a roaring fire in the\
  \ grate. As I have no coal, nor wood, I will burn the beheaded vipers, for there\
  \ are many of them and I suspect they will ignite well. I dried them thoroughly\
  \ by putting them in the airing-cupboard under a pile of blankets. The blankets,\
  \ incidentally, were not stolen. I wove them myself, when I was a child, and capable\
  \ of weaving at the loom for hours upon end, humming old Latvian folk tunes to myself.\
  \ In those long ago days I could never remember the words to the songs, except for\
  \ one, and that only partially. In papa's translation, it went like this: \u201C\
  There is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green / But black is the\
  \ crow in the [something] tree / And lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd's lass\
  \ has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the crow has flown away,\
  \ my love / And the ducks have left the lake\u201D.\nIt's time I made that telephone\
  \ call.\n\nSome of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire, gesticulating.\n\
