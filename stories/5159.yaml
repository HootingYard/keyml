text: "The history of Britain, 1939\u20132010, in seventy-seven words:\n\u201CThe\
  \ British soul was at its zenith when everyone had clipped accents and sex was furtive\
  \ and all men wore hats and leapt onto steam locomotives as they pulled out of the\
  \ station (before\_alighting at Boxhill and Westhumble) and thin-moustached officers\
  \ in\_tropical outposts sweated gin-and-tonic and quoted Latin proverbs; and everything\
  \ that's happened since, from the welfare state to\_The X Factor to the Guardian\
  \ website, has been unmistakeably symptomatic of our purposeless spiritual decline.\u201D\
  \nThus Brit, over at The Dabbler.\n[2010-09-01]"
