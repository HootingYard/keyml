  \ Wonders for bringing to our attention this map of roadside attractions, eccentric\
  \ museums, and other delights. If you are planning a day out, why not visit the\
  \ Unclaimed Baggage Centre in Alabama, or the Brothel Art Museum in Nevada, or indeed\
  \ the Harold Warp Pioneer Village in Nebraska? Personally, I am rather taken with\
  \ the Field Of Giant Corn Ears in Ohio. Readers\u2019 reports from their travels\
  \ are most welcome, so do keep me informed if you happen upon any of these magnificent\
  \ attractions.\n[2008-01-11]"
