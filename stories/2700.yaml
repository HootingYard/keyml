text: "Binder's first symphony is cranky. The second is based on the sound of winches.\
  \ In the third symphony, Binder drags us through his mental muck. The fourth is\
  \ of a piece with the first. The fifth, the majestic fifth, owes much to pomposity.\
  \ The sixth is tart, and the seventh tarter still, while the eighth, the so-called\
  \ \u201Csausage-shaped symphony\u201D, is radiant. For his ninth symphony, Binder\
  \ donned a pair of muslin gloves. Dachshunds and mastiffs bark and howl in the tenth,\
  \ owls hoot in the eleventh. The twelfth is sordid. The thirteenth symphony had\
  \ its premiere in an abandoned aircraft hangar. \u201CA pimple burst,\u201D said\
  \ Chumpot, of number fourteen. He never heard the fifteenth, for Binder had him\
  \ shot. Gunfire is heard at the beginning of the sixteenth. Symphony Number Seventeen\
  \ ends with the cracking of a plank. Eighteen is hated, nineteen sounds like a forest\
  \ in the rain, and by the time he wrote number twenty Binder was taking vitamin\
  \ pills twice a day. The twenty-first symphony is usually played backwards. The\
  \ twenty-second has to be heard through a hat with flaps. The twenty-third is obstinate,\
  \ like a mule, or like the donkeys of Binder's twenty-fourth. Take a stick to the\
  \ stalls for twenty-five, and a bucket to the circle for twenty-six. The twenty-seventh\
  \ symphony can look after itself. Number twenty-eight uses a motif of milk. Twenty-nine\
  \ is tarter even than seven. Thirty is so groovy you might die. When the idea for\
  \ his thirty-first symphony popped into Binder's brain, he was aboard a great steamship.\
  \ Its sinking is mourned in the thirty-second. Thirty-three was commissioned by\
  \ Stalin. The score for Symphony Number Thirty-Four, the \u201CSymphony of Buttons\u201D\
  , calls for several buttons and a hurdy-gurdy. Thirty-five is mostly silent, or\
  \ at least so quiet one strains one's ears to hear a damned thing. Binder's favourite\
  \ was his thirty-sixth. The thirty-seventh lacks elegance. Thirty-eight is gaudy.\
  \ Thirty-nine is the music of champions. Forty falls flat. Forty-one comes from\
  \ outer space. The opening bars of Binder's forty-second are used as the theme to\
  \ a piece of TV tosh. Symphony forty-three has a certain relentless pigginess. Symphony\
  \ forty-four is birdy, not piggy. Forty-five is just grating. Forty-six, Binder's\
  \ longest symphony by far, frightens both birds and pigs. Forty-seven is played\
  \ in a ditch. Forty-eight is all tinkly and twee. Contemplating the pippy splendour\
  \ of his forty-ninth and final symphony, Binder was heard to remark that it reminded\
  \ him of the burning cities he had skulked in as an orphan child.\n[2009-07-25]"
