  \ Jellyfish session\u201D, when Lepke B. and I performed at the now-demolished theatre\
  \ in October. In the accompanying snap, Lepke is but an orange blur, but this is\
  \ hardly surprising given the dizzying physical manoeuvres he adopts when plying\
  \ his art. The voice you hear introducing us is the Benevolent Dictator of ResonanceFM,\
  \ Ed Baxter (as featured in The Independent On Sunday Happy List 2009).\nListen\
