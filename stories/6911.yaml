text: "\nDevoted Hooting Yardists will be familiar with the contents of Key's Cupboard\
  \ this week, where I bring to the attention of Dabbler readers the egg-counting\
  \ antics of George Orwell. I often reflect\u2014and by \u201Coften\u201D I mean\
  \ daily, daily\u2014on the fact that two titanic figures in the cultural landscape\
  \ of the twentieth century had such wildly divergent attitudes to eggs. There is\
  \ Orwell, thin and wiry, with his love of eggs, and Alfred Hitchcock, plump and\
  \ bloated, who was terrified of them.\nIt could be argued that Orwell was not an\
  \ egg lover as such, that he merely had a mania for counting them, a mania that\
  \ could have found expression in the counting of other farm (or smallholding) produce.\
  \ Frankly I cannot be bothered to do the biographical research which would be necessary\
  \ to write a monograph entitled George Orwell's Attitude Towards Eggs. Perhaps someone\
  \ else could take on that important task.\n[2011-07-15]"
