text: "Damp bag, hot talc. Flimflam of the highest order. Cutthroats aboard ship,\
  \ the ship of state, flying under a false flag, a flag of convenience, registered\
  \ in a distant port. Pettigrew snarled. Melville writes somewhere of \u201Cinhuman\
  \ hooting\u201D. A prize for the first to find out where. I already know, because\
  \ I read the words this morning, by dawn's early light, or by candlelight, or both,\
  \ or neither, squinting at the small print.\nDoes Peter Quint ever squint, in The\
  \ Turn Of The Screw? I don't know. That was Henry James, of course, not Herman Melville,\
  \ both Americans, but only one of them ended his days in the grip of mad delusions.\
  \ Or perhaps they both did.\nBoth did. Both did. If you say it aloud, over and over\
  \ again, its meaning becomes lost, it becomes a kind of atavistic chant, to be chanted\
  \ while leaping and capering around a bonfire in a night swarming with demons, in\
  \ a forest clearing, your body painted with woad.\nBoth did, both did. It could\
  \ be the name of a god, but what sort of god? The god of bees, the god of herons.\
  \ Perhaps, at a pinch, the otter god. I can well imagine, if daubed in woad, shrieking\
  \ a prayer to Both Did the otter god, by the light of a bonfire in a forest clearing,\
  \ waving a tally stick, thousands of years ago. Thousands and thousands. Or just\
  \ last week. But if last week, the kind of thing you might get arrested for these\
  \ days.\nImagine the interrogation, in the cold bare room of the police station.\
  \ You would have to explain yourself to win your freedom. Otherwise they might lock\
  \ you up, judging you as mad as the aged Henry James. I think Herman Melville's\
  \ wife, at some point, was under pressure to have her husband declared insane. She\
  \ refused.\n\u201CHis wife refused\u201D. The title of a piece from David Byrne's\
  \ score for The Catherine Wheel. Choreographed, as I recall, by Twyla Tharp. Now\
  \ there is a woman who lends herself to anagranmatization. Especially in Welsh.\
  \ And while we are on the subject of Welsh, however fugitively, is it not splendid\
  \ that the Welsh language word for a microwave oven is a popty-ping? That, at least,\
  \ is the claim made by Roger Lewis, in one of his newspaper articles.\nIt has ever\
  \ been a wonder to me that I am not employed by a newspaper to write a column. I\
  \ could bash out a few hundred words on any subject required. Prongs, tines, and\
  \ nozzles would be three examples of topics I could blather about. Not to mention\
  \ damp bags and hot talc, with which we began, if you remember. But what of damp\
  \ talc and hot bags? What then, what then?\nI used to know a couple whose idea of\
  \ sightseeing, when on holiday, was to gaze into the windows of butcher's shops,\
  \ appraising the meat on display. What curious behaviour. I recall that I was both\
  \ amused and a little disgusted, not a common combination of emotions. I think there\
  \ may, too, have been an admixture of contempt.\nContempt. Le m\xE9pris, in French,\
  \ and the title of a 1963 film by Jean-Luc Godard. I have seen it twice, both times\
  \ on television, both times long ago, and all I remember of it is a shot\u2014or\
  \ shots\u2014of an impossibly blue sea, the bluest sea I have ever seen in cinema.\
  \ I think the film is considered a masterpiece. But then there is a certain type\
  \ of film buff who will forever wax preposterous about Godard.\nThe auteur Godard\
  \ and the otter-god. Now there is a pairing, almost homonymic, a pairing that lends\
  \ itself, as Twyla Tharp does to anagrams, to the method outlined by Raymond Roussel\
  \ in How I Wrote Certain Of My Books. I could write a piece about a wholly imaginary\
  \ Godard film, one in which the blue, blue sea is reflected, blue-dazzlingly, in\
  \ the glass window of a butcher's shop. The film could begin with a quotation from\
  \ Herman Melville and end with one from Henry James. And in between? In between,\
  \ for roughly ninety minutes? I have no idea, for as I explained to a French art\
  \ critic in New York only the other day, I do not have a visual imagination. That\
  \ is why I work with words.\n[2013-03-13]"
