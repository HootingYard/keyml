  \ with flippers, that will bark at you as you throw sprats to it from a bucket?\
  \ It was with no little relief that I learned it was not that kind of seal.\n\n\
  As the world mourns Edward \u201CThe Tedster\u201D Kennedy, let us not forget another\
  \ American politician of the era, whose life we can celebrate by banding together\
  \ in an association of enthusiasts to practise his favourite pastime.\nUPDATE\_\
