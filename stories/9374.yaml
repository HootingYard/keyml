text: "Captain's Log, stardate the Ides of March, Year Dot plus [redacted]. I am sick\
  \ of this damned log. Literally sick. Whenever I open it to scribble another entry\
  \ I am overcome by a wave of nausea. I am convinced I have a palsy and an ague,\
  \ even though I would be hard pressed to define exactly what a palsy is or an ague\
  \ is. Were there a medical dictionary aboard the starship I would look them up.\
  \ But if ever there was a medical dictionary it disappeared along with the doctor,\
  \ Von Straubenzee, a year ago today. A year or a space-year, I cannot be certain.\
  \ The Captain and Second Officer Wilmot and that rascal Mister Poxhaven vanished\
  \ too, leaving me to take command, and to scribble in the Captain's Log. I was going\
  \ to cross out the word Captain's, with a big thick bold indelible black black black\
  \ black black marker pen, and insert instead Purser's, me being Purser Blot. I don't\
  \ know what gave me pause, unless it was the terrible shaking of my hand occasioned\
  \ by the palsy. But I could barely lift the pen, so it remains the Captain's Log\
  \ rather than the Palsied Purser's Log. I am using a special lightweight space-biro\
  \ to do my scribbling. It puts no strain on my quivering white tiny frozen hand.\n\
  My hands are as tiny as those of the composer Scriabin. I wanted to compose music,\
  \ delirious and ecstatic music, but instead I was sent to starship pursers\u2019\
  \ training academy. There was no music there, only bleeping and whooshing and buzzing\
  \ noises. At least it prepared me for the starship itself, where there is a constant\
  \ din of bleeping and whooshing and buzzing, punctuated only by the strange gurgling\
  \ sounds made by the ship's vampire, Bosun Cugat. He claims they are involuntary,\
  \ his gurglings, and apologises, a little too fulsomely for my liking. I would have\
  \ him confined to the brig were it not that he would simply melt the metal bars\
  \ with his basilisk glare and escape. I am not clear precisely what kind of vampire\
  \ he is, just as I am unclear about palsy and ague. Ach Gott!, I was not cut out\
  \ for this life. I ought to be sprawled on a divan in a dacha, composing ecstatic\
  \ music.\nCaptain's Log, stardate Ides of March plus one. At the time of his death\
  \ in stardate 1915, Scriabin was working on his Mysterium, of which he wrote: \u201C\
  There will not be a single spectator. All will be participants. The work requires\
  \ special people, special artists and a completely new culture. The cast of performers\
  \ includes an orchestra, a large mixed choir, an instrument with visual effects,\
  \ dancers, a procession, incense, and rhythmic textural articulation. The cathedral\
  \ in which it will take place will not be of one single type of stone but will continually\
  \ change with the atmosphere and motion of the Mysterium. This will be done with\
  \ the aid of mists and lights, which will modify the architectural contours.\u201D\
  \ He intended that the performance of this work, to be given in the foothills of\
  \ the Himalayas, would last seven days and would be followed by the end of the world,\
  \ with the human race replaced by \u201Cnobler beings\u201D.\nCaptain's Log, stardate\
  \ Ides of March plus two. Bosun Cugat confronted me at suppertime yesterday and\
  \ revealed that he had snuck a peek at this Log. He said I ought to be using it\
  \ to note pertinent details of the starship and its space-voyage, rather than wittering\
  \ on about Scriabin. He has whiffy oxters. I threw an aerosol can of space-deodorant\
  \ at him and told him to use it. I am a nobler being than Bosun Cugat. I would like\
  \ to compose my own Mysterium, but there is far too much faffing about to do on\
  \ this damned starship. I think we have entered the Belt of Jiffy. I looked out\
  \ of the starboard window and saw a gas giant.\nCaptain's Log, stardate Ides of\
  \ March plus three. Whether or not we were in the Belt of Jiffy yesterday, we are\
  \ nowhere near it now. Bosun Cugat has seized control of the starship and we are\
  \ hurtling towards Saturn at warp factor God knows what. He has locked me in the\
  \ space-janitor's cupboard, with my biro and the captain's log and a flask of dandelion\
  \ and burdock and a few sticks of celery. Every now and then he comes hammering\
  \ on the door and shouting questions at me, but refuses to let me out. His questions\
  \ are technical ones, to which I do not always have ready answers. He wants to know\
  \ if we should pass through the rings of Saturn or try to avoid them. Apparently\
  \ he is going to land on the planet's surface and go in search of the Suet Siphons\
  \ of Saturn. Being a vampire, he will not require a spacesuit. What in heaven's\
  \ name he wants with suet I have no idea.\nRummaging around in the cupboard I found\
  \ a piccolo and a cowbell. I am passing the time composing a piece of delirious\
  \ and ecstatic music for piccolo, cowbell and celery sticks. Scriabin would be proud\
  \ of me, at least I like to think so. Hail to thee, blessed Alexander Nikolayevich!\n\
  Captain's Log, stardate Ides of March plus four. A couple of hours after we landed\
  \ on Saturn, I heard Bosun Cugat's dainty footsteps padding along the corridor.\
  \ He stopped outside the space-janitor's cupboard and the door whooshed open and\
  \ he moaned and fell, crumpled, into my arms. For hours I cradled him, mussing his\
  \ filthy hair and making cooing noises into his pointy ear. I know my duty. Eventually\
  \ he gathered himself, and explained that he had located the suet siphons, teeming\
  \ thousands of them, all lined up in neat rows on some kind of Saturnine plain or\
  \ pampas. And every single one was exhausted. Not a spit of suet could be eked from\
  \ a single siphon.\n\u201CDo you not understand what this means?\u201D he shrieked,\
  \ \u201COthers have been here before us!\u201D\nI had to admit that this put something\
  \ of a damper on our five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out\
  \ new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.\n\u201C\
  Should we go in search of the suet?\u201D I asked.\nBut before Bosun Cugat could\
  \ reply, he was engulfed in mists and lights which modified his corporeal contours.\
  \ In front of my eyes, he was transmogrified into a nobler being. I looked out of\
  \ the starboard window and saw that the universe had vanished. Scriabin's Mysterium\
  \ had come to pass. It was the end of the world. I picked up the piccolo and cowbell\
  \ and celery sticks and played a threnody.\n\nAlexander Nikolayevich Scriabin\n\
