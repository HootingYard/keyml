text: "Between now and Christmas, we are celebrating ten years of the Hooting Yard\
  \ website by reposting an item from each calendar year. Today, The Bilgewater Elegies,\
  \ a thrilling episode from the annals of Dobson, which first appeared on Tuesday\
  \ 26 July 2005.\nLike the Arctic tern, which is neither from the Arctic, nor a tern,\
  \ Dobson's famous Bilgewater Elegies are emphatically not elegies about bilgewater.\
  \ I'm sorry, I have begun that all wrong. The Arctic tern is from the Arctic, and\
  \ it is a tern. I was thinking of some other bird of misleading nomenclature, or\
  \ perhaps not a bird, but an animal, at any rate, which is not what its name indicates.\
  \ I will try to remember what it was I was thinking of. The central point remains\
  \ true, however, that the Bilgewater Elegies are not elegies and not about bilgewater,\
  \ except in passing.\nDobson wrote these magnificent pieces in a wintry month or\
  \ two while living in a far distant land whence he had gone to escape having to\
  \ pay his gas bill. Keen students of Dobson's life know that gas in many forms seems\
  \ to take on a quite bewildering importance. In one biography, for example, there\
  \ are three times as many index entries for \u201Cgas\u201D as there are for \u201C\
  pamphlets\u201D. Marsh gas, in particular, permeates much of Dobson's middle years,\
  \ almost as if it were what he was breathing instead of oxygen. Perhaps it was.\n\
  The out-of-print pamphleteer had a deep and abiding reluctance to pay for gas, and\
  \ often considered living somewhere powered entirely by electricity, or by the wind\
  \ or the sun, or indeed existing without being dependent upon any source of energy\
  \ whatsoever. But, as Marigold Chew has noted, rail as Dobson might, he was drawn\
  \ inexorably to the blue, blue flames of burning gas, a man mesmerised.\nI was thinking\
  \ about guinea pigs, of course, which are not from Guinea and are not pigs. Why\
  \ I confused them with birds, particularly Arctic terns, is beyond me.\nThat winter\
  \ season, then, determined to outwit those who provided him with gas, Dobson decamped\
  \ to that far distant country, mountainous and cold, remote yet populous, a land\
  \ of which he knew nothing except the design of its flag. On arrival he discovered\
  \ that even this minimal knowledge was redundant, as there had been a revolution.\
  \ The old flag had been ditched, and a new one\u2014pink, black, green\u2014flew\
  \ from flagpoles wherever he looked. Between the seaport and the chalet where he\
  \ was to live for two months, Dobson counted at least seven hundred flags.\nIn the\
  \ chalet, Dobson closed the traditional butcher's drapes and placed his canister\
  \ of calor gas in a cubby hole. Gnawing on a nut, for he was forever nut-gnawing,\
  \ he considered his surroundings. It was a small chalet, with no hidden chambers,\
  \ false walls, or concreted-over ancient wells. Dobson was perplexed at the absurd\
  \ number of metal coat-hangers in the master wardrobe, and the equally numerous\
  \ drawing-pins in the drawer atop the cubby hole. The cubby hole itself was just\
  \ the right size for his canister. He was looking forward to burning the portable\
  \ gas as the evening drew in, but it was still morning, so he curbed his impatience\
  \ by exploring the outcrop on which the chalet perched. Knowing nothing of geology,\
  \ and caring less, this took Dobson about five minutes, or about the time it took\
  \ him to gnaw one of his brazil nuts to nothing. Later in life, of course, Dobson\
  \ wrote a number of pamphlets on geological topics, as an exercise. Curiously, he\
  \ never wrote about brazil nuts.\nTemporarily out of reach of his gas-creditors,\
  \ Dobson decided to spend his first afternoon in the chalet on the outcrop in that\
  \ faraway flag-mad land writing. But he was by turns listless and restless, and\
  \ irritated that his new domain failed to inspire him. By four o\u2019 clock, having\
  \ scratched a mere dozen words in his notepad, then torn out the page and set fire\
  \ to it, he went for a walk. Turning his back on the outcrop, he headed downhill,\
  \ towards the nearest village, through which his taxi had taken him that morning.\
  \ He had paid it no attention, for his eyes had been shut, as they often were in\
  \ taxis. Dobson used such rides for reverie rather than observation.\nMarigold Chew\
  \ once put her hand to a story about Dobson's walk that day. It was called The Village\
  \ That Lacked Basic Sanitation, and she refused ever to allow it to be published.\
  \ All we know for certain is that Dobson returned to the chalet that evening astride\
  \ a massive, ungainly horse, of chestnut complexion, called Tim. He seems to have\
  \ been convinced that mice were scurrying uncontrollably about the chalet, and that\
  \ they would be frightened away by the sight of a big horse. In truth, there were\
  \ no mice. Dobson had fallen victim to delusional visions because of the high altitude.\
  \ Nevertheless, the presence of Tim, snorting and stamping his hooves, becalmed\
  \ the pamphleteer, and the next morning he dragged a wooden table and chair outside\
  \ the front of the chalet and sat down to compose the Bilgewater Elegies.\nHere\
  \ is a list of buckets of bilgewater I have seen, he wrote, the famous opening words\
  \ of what was to be his own favourite among his countless pamphlets. He spent whole\
  \ days in the crisp open air, scribbling away, occasionally filling Tim's nosebag\
  \ with horse-food. In the evenings he sat in the chalet staring at the blue glow\
  \ of burning calor gas. His nights were untroubled by nightmares. Every few days\
  \ a panting cadet from the insanitary village would deliver a metal tapping machine\
  \ message from Marigold Chew, keeping Dobson abreast of events at home.\nDobson\
  \ wrote the final words of the Elegies on a bright day in October. On the same day,\
  \ there was a counterrevolution in that cold distant country. The pink and black\
  \ and green flags were torn down and stamped into the muck, swiftly replaced by\
  \ red and blue and yellow flags. The panting cadet delivered Marigold's latest message,\
  \ his cap askew and bloodstains on his sleeves. The look in his eyes told Dobson\
  \ it was time to flee. He made the cadet promise to look after Tim the massive horse,\
  \ packed up his things, and headed off for the seaport on foot. The gas canister\
  \ was empty, and his work was done.\nDon't forget that you can make a donation to\

  \ says: \u201CI made a donation and doing so warmed the cockles of my heart!\u201D\
