  \ to spend the day as a farmer's son, an eighteenth century aristocrat, an octogenarian\
  \ lunatic, or a clown, in all of which roles I am of course equally convincing.\
  \ Busy schedule of acting, directing, rehearsing, filming, recording, and administration,\
  \ all fuelled by more and more cocaine. Felt a bit queasy and conked out.\n[2013-01-12]"
