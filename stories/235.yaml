text: "A boffin was pouring bleach into a funnel when along came a guttersnipe.\n\u201C\
  How now, boffin,\u201D said the guttersnipe, \u201CI am but a poor guttersnipe and\
  \ for raiment I have only rags, as you can see. If I become a boffin's assistant\
  \ I can cover these rags with a fine white coat and then I shall not be spat upon\
  \ by citizens as I toil along the lanes of this shining yet merciless city. Can\
  \ I pour that tinted bleach into the funnel for you? Then you would be free to go\
  \ and take a nap, or to think higher thoughts.\u201D\nNow as it happened, the boffin\
  \ had been thinking how useful it would be to have an assistant. Yet the words of\
  \ the guttersnipe set him atrembling, and he had to steady his hands as he continued\
  \ to pour the blue tinted bleach into the funnel.\n\u201CYour offer is most welcome,\
  \ young scalliwag,\u201D he replied, mistaking the guttersnipe for a scalliwag,\
  \ \u201CBut I fear I must decline. Let me explain why, while I pour the rest of\
  \ this cobalt blue tinted bleach into, or rather through, my funnel. I had a very\
  \ privileged upbringing. I grew up in a castle on the coast. Gulls, guillemots and\
  \ stormy petrels perched on the windowsill of my nursery. My parents employed numerous\
  \ servants. As a boffin's assistant, you would be a sort of servant. Ma and Pa were\
  \ unfailingly kind to me, but they mistreated their valets and maids and pages and\
  \ cooks and chauffeurs and biddies etcetera etcetera terribly. One was confined\
  \ to an oubliette and fed with contaminated lemon curd. One was thrown into the\
  \ sea in a sack. Another had his head kicked in. A butler named Jarvis had his reputation\
  \ sullied through gross defamation of his character. One of the maids was trampled\
  \ under the huge thumping feet of Pa's robot brontosaurus. All of them were regularly\
  \ beaten with shovels. One was forbidden ever to wash his hair. One was made to\
  \ sprint back and forth to the post office, repeatedly, despite being in the desperate\
  \ stages of an ague. None of them were permitted raincoats. A Cyclopean page was\
  \ ridiculed. Another page was torn limb from limb, tied to a quartet of wild stallions.\
  \ The underbutler had his shoelaces destroyed. One was burned with flaming tongs.\
  \ They were all made to sleep in a dank and dingy cave at the foot of the cliffs.\
  \ Ma hacked into one parlourmaid's computer and left it riddled with viruses. Another\
  \ was upbraided in the presence of a priest. One was cast adrift in rough seas in\
  \ a boat made of concrete. A hairy gardener was sent off to a zoo. When any of the\
  \ servants died, their corpses were hung on gibbets and left to rot. No cruelty\
  \ was beyond Ma and Pa. I vowed, when I reached adulthood, that I would never have\
  \ a servant of my own, for fear of what I might be capable of. That is why I am\
  \ pouring this thick cobalt blue tinted bleach into the funnel myself, even though\
  \ my towering intellect would be better engaged cogitating upon the deepest profundities\
  \ of existence, as you so judiciously suggest.\u201D\nThe guttersnipe nodded, and\
  \ limped sadly away. Later, by a pond, he wept, for in his short and brutish life\
  \ he had never encountered a boffin of such moral rectitude.\nSource\_: Mawkish\
