text: "We continue our tenth anniversary celebrations wth a potsage [sic] from the\
  \ year of Our Lord 2010. In the autumn of that year, I embarked on a series of twenty-six\
  \ alphabetical entries, and this one is C for Canker Worm, which appeared on Sunday\
  \ 19 September 2010.\nSorely perplexed was I, that I was waking each morning, and\
  \ had been for months on end, engulfed in a miasma of unutterable spiritual desolation.\
  \ I sought advice from a quack I encountered on a charabanc outing. He was sitting\
  \ in the seat next to mine, all wrapped up in a visible aura of wisdom, a sort of\
  \ pinkish violet haze, and his one good eye seemed, to me, to emit a ray, a ray\
  \ that could pierce my spiritual innards were he but to train it upon me. I tapped\
  \ him on the shoulder, so he would turn to face me.\n\u201CYou look like the kind\
  \ of fellow who might be able to diagnose the miasma of spiritual desolation within\
  \ which I tremble, engulfed,\u201D I said, not beating about the bush.\n\u201CI\
  \ am that man,\u201D he replied, and about thirty seconds later he added \u201C\
  You have a canker worm nestling within the very core of your soul, and it is gnawing\
  \ away at your spiritual vitals.\u201D\n\u201CI knew I could rely on you,\u201D\
  \ I said, possibly a bit too loudly, for elsewhere in the charabanc heads turned\
  \ and craned to look. I slipped some coinage into the quack's outstretched palm,\
  \ settled back in my seat, and shut my eyes. Soon enough we reached the destination\
  \ of our outing, a ruined fortification of great antiquity and becrumblement, lashed\
  \ by wind and rain. Tugging my windcheater close about my puny frame, I fairly skipped\
  \ out of the charabanc into the mud, animated by a sense that, having discovered\
  \ the cause of my unutterable spiritual desolation, I could now do something about\
  \ it.\nBut what was I to do? The canker worm was nestled in my soul, and we still\
  \ do not know whereabouts within us the soul resides. Indeed, there is a growing\
  \ body of opinion that we do not have souls at all, that the whole idea is a phantasy,\
  \ or a metaphor, or just blithering nonsense. Well, I laugh in the face of those\
  \ who deny the soul's existence! I may not know precisely where mine is, in brain\
  \ or heart or spleen or kidney, but I know that it is about the size and shape and\
  \ colour of a plum tomato. I was told as much by a Magus at a seaside resort, long,\
  \ long ago.\nTraipsing round the ruin, and then on the charabanc journey back\u2014\
  during which there was no sign of the quack, his seat next to mine having been taken\
  \ by a television chat show host to whom I could not quite put a name, and dare\
  \ not ask, for he was frowning mightily\u2014I mentally chewed over what I might\
  \ do about my canker worm. Was there some substance or formula I could ingest that\
  \ would do me no harm but would blast the little canker worm to perdition? Some\
  \ potion or preparation, of milk and aniseed and potable gold? Or could I somehow\
  \ excise it with a pair of ethereal pliers? That might put me at risk of irreversible\
  \ psychic injury, of course, but was it a price worth paying?\nI juggled these and\
  \ other thoughts until my brain overheated, at which point I went to bed, for it\
  \ was by now late and dark. While I slept, I had a dream, like Dr King, and when\
  \ I awoke, I wanted to go and stand on a podium, like Dr King, and declaim the contents\
  \ of my dream to the gathered masses, declaim it in powerful preacherman language.\
  \ It took me a few seconds to realise that I had not the magnetic charisma of Dr\
  \ King to attract the teeming thousands to hear me. The next thought that popped\
  \ in to my head was to wonder precisely when \u201CDr King\u201D became the preferred\
  \ way of referring to the Reverend Martin Luther King, and if this had happened\
  \ at the same time as it became obligatory for all United States Presidential candidates\
  \ so to mention \u201CDr King\u201D in at least one campaign speech, to garner guaranteed\
  \ applause. Seconds later, the next, and most important thought, occurred to me.\
  \ For the first time in months, I had woken up without feeling engulfed in a miasma\
  \ of unutterable spiritual desolation! Quite the contrary. I was filled with vim\
  \ and gush and pep. I was ready for a large eggy breakfast, and nothing was going\
  \ to stop me.\nTucking in to my eggs, prepared in accordance with the Bl\xF6tzmann\
  \ system (see the appendix to the third handbook in the Lavender Series), I tried\
  \ to remember my dream, as clearly it provided the clue to my new-found mental and\
  \ spiritual wellbeing. But I could remember nothing, so after a post-breakfast hike\
  \ along paths and lanes and canal towpaths, and through a municipal park, I took\
  \ from its cubby my hat-sized metal cone, plopped it atop my head, aligned my head\
  \ at the correct angle (see the instructions in Bl\xF6tzmann's seventh handbook,\
  \ Lilac Series) and stared into space, mouth hanging open, dribbling.\nGosh! It\
  \ soon became apparent that, in the mists of sleep, I had visualised my little canker\
  \ worm, gnawing its way through my plum tomato-shaped soul, and instead of seeing\
  \ it as an invader to be repulsed or expunged, I had cosseted it as a pet. I named\
  \ it Dagobert, and furnished it with a hutch, and pampered it, and took it for walks,\
  \ insofar as a worm can walk, attached to a lead. The lead was made of ectoplasmic\
  \ string from a spirit-viola.\nThe question now was whether I was able to apply\
  \ these methods to my real, albeit invisible and intangible, spiritual canker worm.\
  \ Perhaps, if I kept the metal cone on my head beyond the recommended time-limit,\
  \ thus risking weird head judderings, paralysis, and death, I might be granted the\
  \ powers to construct Dagobert's little hutch. After all, I reasoned\u2014ha, reason!\u2014\
  if he was snug in his hutch he would desist from his gnawing, wouldn't he? I was\
  \ certain, though on what grounds I knew not, that my plum tomato soul could regenerate\
  \ sufficiently to repair all the damage caused by the gnawing. But where would I\
  \ take my little canker worm on its necessary walks? Under the metal cone, my head\
  \ grew hot and frazzled, and I fell into a swoon\u2026\nThe following week, I once\
  \ again boarded the charabanc for an outing, this time to a den of iniquity preserved\
  \ in quicklime. I sat down next to a different quack, one whose visible aura was\
  \ purple and golden, and whose spirit-piercing ray projected, not from his eye,\
  \ but from a star in the centre of his forehead.\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D I said,\
  \ \u201CBut you look like the kind of fellow who might be able to see into my soul\
  \ and tell me if it is being gnawed at by a little canker worm named Dagobert.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI am that man!\u201D he roared in reply, and aimed his ray at me. I waited\
  \ for him to report his findings. As I waited, the driver lost control of the charabanc\
  \ and we veered scree scraw off the road and plunged into a ditch. The ditch was\
  \ riddled with puddles, and each puddle was rife with worms, and some of them were\
  \ canker worms, and they were legion, and uncountable. But somehow, I could count\
  \ them, and I did, and I learned that as we flailed, panting and stricken, in the\
  \ ditch, their number had increased by one. Little Dagobert had gone to join his\
  \ fellows in their cankerous ditch-puddle of doom, and I was free!\n[2013-12-21]"
