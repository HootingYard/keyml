text: "\nPansy Cradledew did not believe me when I told her there was a film called\
  \ Billy Two Hats. She insisted I must be making it up, for my own amusement. But\
  \ there is such a film, a western, made in 1974, directed by Ted Kotcheff and starring\
  \ Gregory Peck and Desi Arnaz Jr.\nTed Kotcheff is half Bulgarian, half Canadian,\
  \ and his birth name is Velichko Todorov Tsochev. Gregory Peck you will be familiar\
  \ with. His surname is the same word we use for what a bird does with its beak,\
  \ when given millet, for example. The one thing I know about Desi Arnaz Jr is that,\
  \ before becoming an actor, he worked as a birdcage cleaner. I learned this from\
  \ a popular bestseller of the 1970s called The Book Of Lists.\nThough I mentioned\
  \ Billy Two Hats in conversation with Pansy, I have never actually seen the film.\
  \ I have always thought it was the story of a cowboy with two heads, hence his two\
  \ hats. There is much that a skilled screenwriter could do with such a character.\
  \ His two heads could prompt either comedy or tragedy. He could be played by two\
  \ actors, or, using special effects, by one. He might very well frighten his own\
  \ horse.\nIf the two hats Billy wore atop his two heads were wide-brimmed cowboy\
  \ hats\u2014as, in a western, they surely would be\u2014then of necessity he would\
  \ have to crane each neck, one significantly to the left, the other to the right,\
  \ in order to avoid brim crushage, or worse, one hat dislodging the other hat, leaving\
  \ it fallen and stranded in the dust as he rides off on his horse across the sweeping\
  \ buffalo-riddled plains into the sunset, as tends to happen in westerns, particularly\
  \ just before the closing credits.\nI have often wondered if there is an autobiographical\
  \ element to the film. Did Ted Kotcheff feel compelled to make it because he himself\
  \ has two heads, one Bulgarian and one Canadian? I have never seen a photograph\
  \ of him, so this must remain conjecture. But it would be no surprise if this were\
  \ the case.\nThere remains the question of casting. Was it intentional to have,\
  \ as the two leads, actors who, by name and past employment, cannot help but make\
  \ us think of birds? It is a great shame that a role was not found, in the screenplay,\
  \ for Tippi Hedren. Tippi has only one head, as far as I know, but she is a dab\
  \ hand at acting with birds.\nBilly Two Hats is almost certainly available on DVD,\
  \ which, as any fule kno, stands for Dick Van Dyke. The cheerful chimney sweep did\
  \ not appear in either Billy Two Hats or The Birds, but in a better, more charming\
  \ world, he would have. Perhaps he was not cast in the western because he, like\
  \ Tippi Hedren, is a monohead.\n[2018-03-14]"
