text: "The picture of Pebblehead's typewriter posted yesterday prompted a bulging\
  \ postbag, with numerous readers clamouring for further particulars of the bestselling\
  \ paperbackist's working practices. Among the commoner questions were: How does\
  \ Pebblehead manage to bash out so many potboilers? How many typewriters does he\
  \ get through in an average week? Is he capable of writing a word without having\
  \ that pipe, crammed with acrid Serbian tobacco, clamped between his teeth? Does\
  \ he employ a team of monkey typists?\nI was about to write, \u201CAlas, we may\
  \ never know\u2026\u201D, when all of a sudden, a moment ago, Alan the postal crow\
  \ flew in through the crow-vent with a press release clutched in his beak. I gave\
  \ him some millet, and he relinquished the paper, upon which the following was printed,\
  \ by the looks of it on a wonky Gestetner machine:\nRaymond Roussel told us How\
  \ I Wrote Certain Of My Books in 1932. Now, Pebblehead promises to tell us How I\
  \ Wrote Certain Of My Potboilers. This will undoubtedly be the publishing sensation\
  \ of 2013, or 2014, or whenever Pebblehead manages to deliver the manuscript, in\
  \ between bashing out hundreds more potboilers and destroying quite a few typewriters\
  \ in the process, while monkeys cavort around him in his chalet o\u2019 prose.\n\
  Sucking on his pipe, its bowl stuffed with acrid Serbian tobacco, the bestselling\
  \ paperbackist said: \u201CBegone, Krishnan Guru-Murthy! I have no idea what you\
  \ and your camera crew from Channel 4 News think you're doing, camped out in front\
  \ of my chalet o\u2019 prose. You are interrupting the creative process of the most\
  \ tireless potboilerist in the world, and if you do not leave immediately I shall\
  \ have you set upon by Alpine zombies in tattered Nazi uniforms brandishing ray\
  \ guns from outer space!\u201D\nIf and when How I Wrote Certain Of My Potboilers\
  \ is ever actually published, review copies will be sent out via Alan the postal\
  \ crow. Make sure your crow-vent is clear and free from sordid and unseemly detritus,\
  \ bones of voles, etcetera.\n[2013-02-04]"
