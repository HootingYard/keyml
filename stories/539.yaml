text: "The engine of capitalism is said to be the creation of desires. Advertising\
  \ and allied brain-manipulation techniques persuade us to covet things we did not\
  \ even know we wanted, and illusory wants soon become needs. Sprawling insouciantly\
  \ in my ivory tower, it is very easy to pretend that I am above such grimness. For\
  \ example, I do not own\u2014nor covet\u2014a mobile phone, and would much rather\
  \ curl up with a copy of Jubilate Agno by Christopher Smart than go shopping for\
  \ fripperies. But of course, such pretence is delusional. I am as eager as anyone\
  \ else to get my hands on stuff, depending on the stuff. Thus I am indebted to OutaSpaceman\
  \ for drawing my attention to a product which I did not know existed, but realise\
  \ I have always wanted, no, needed. I can say in all honesty that without this magnificent\
  \ item my life would remain forever incomplete, pointless, wasted.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\
  \n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\nI speak, of course, of the cardboard cut-out model of\
  \ the Hindenburg disaster, available\_here.\n[2008-09-12]"
