text: "On the seafront in the town of Scroonhoonpooge stands the Hotel Splendido!\
  \ (That exclamation mark, by the way, is part of its name, not my own excitable\
  \ interjection.) To the local Scroonhoonpoogers, however, it is invariably known\
  \ as \u201Cthe mysterious hotel\u201D.\nThe mystery of the mysterious hotel is that\
  \ nobody seems to know the nature of its mystery. Like any other hotel, it has seen\
  \ its share of puzzling incidents\u2014a vanished sock in the laundry, intermittent\
  \ hissing noises on the intercom, the face of Stalin on a slice of toast\u2014but\
  \ these are mundane and ephemeral. What is the overarching mystery of the mysterious\
  \ hotel?\nOne man who was unable to prise this question out of his head was Detective\
  \ Captain Unstrebnodtalb. When he was tiny, he regularly stayed at the Hotel Splendido!\
  \ for a summer fortnight, for Scroonhoonpooge was his parents\u2019 favoured holiday\
  \ destination. Early, then, he learned the locals\u2019 term, and badgered his ma\
  \ and his pa and other adults to reveal the mystery to him. But of course nobody\
  \ did, for nobody knew.\nThrough the passing years, and during his career as a tiptop\
  \ detective captain, he never quite stopped thinking about the mystery of the mysterious\
  \ hotel. He no longer visited the seaside resort, for his dear wife was terrified\
  \ of the sea, and all their holidays together were taken at inland spots, forests\
  \ and dingles and coppices.\nBut there came a time when that good woman perished\
  \ in a tobogganing accident, and, the next summer, the widower Unstrebnodtalb determined\
  \ to return to the scene of his youth. Armed, now, with many years\u2019 experience\
  \ of tiptop detective work, he felt confident that he could solve the mystery that\
  \ had perplexed him for so long.\nHe arrived at Scroonhoonpooge Parkway railway\
  \ station on a blisteringly hot July afternoon. He was astonished to note that the\
  \ porter, who took his suitcase from him and carried it the length of the platform,\
  \ all the way to the station gate, was the very same porter he remembered from childhood.\
  \ Yet the man had not aged, at all. Nor had the station itself changed.\n\u201C\
  I feel I am stepping back into the past,\u201D he said to the porter.\n\u201CI'm\
  \ afraid I have no idea what you are talking about, sir,\u201D said the porter.\n\
  They were now at the gate, and Unstrebnodtalb gazed at the town square, and across\
  \ to the seafront, and the back of the Hotel Splendido! Everything seemed utterly\
  \ unchanged from when he had last seen it forty years before.\n\u201CI have not\
  \ been here since I was a child,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd it seems utterly unchanged.\u201D\
  \nThe porter gave him an odd look, as if he were a dangerous lunatic, and hurried\
  \ away to carry another suitcase for another disembarked railway passenger.\nLooking\
  \ about him in wonderment, Unstrebnodtalb made his way to the seafront. Everything\
  \ was as he remembered it\u2014the brass band in the square playing oompah music,\
  \ the pie and pastry shop, the creaking tram with its vampiric conductor, the stone\
  \ statue of Ringo Starr. Bewildered and unnerved, he stepped into the hotel lobby.\n\
  Here, at least, things had changed. If anything, the interior of the Hotel Splendido!\
  \ looked like a vision of the future, the distant future. He marched up to the reception\
  \ desk, which was more like a space age console.\n\u201CI have a reservation,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CDetective Captain Unstrebnodtalb.\u201D\n\u201CAh yes,\u201D said\
  \ the receptionist, peering at the screen of a superdupercomputer. Then, \u201C\
  Oh, I'm sorry. Your room has already been re-reserved by another guest.\u201D\n\u201C\
  What do you mean, re-reserved\u201D\n\u201CWell, it is all hustle and bustle in\
  \ the hotel business, you know. We can't let time stand still.\u201D\nAnd he looked\
  \ up, and Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb realised that the receptionist was a\
  \ hyperintelligent monkey, at an advanced stage of evolution.\n[2013-05-07]"
