  \ list goes back over forty years to 1968 and is available for all to see online.\
  \ Yes, 'tis Art Garfunkel, golden-voiced croonperson and thespian. When you are\
  \ done checking to see which books you and \u201CThe G\u201D (as he is called on\
  \ one section of his site) have both read, you may wish to investigate his transcontinental\
  \ walks (of both the USA and Europe). Oscar Wilde famously said that all Art is\
  \ quite useless, but clearly he was not referring to Mr Garfunkel.\n[2010-08-07]"
