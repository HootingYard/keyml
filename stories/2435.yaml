text: "Long-term readers, and those who regularly frequent the 2003\u20132006 Archive,\
  \ will be aware that in those distant days Hooting Yard had a certain ramshackle\
  \ charm. Mr Key had to be dragged kicking and screaming to use a proper blog format,\
  \ though clearly there are innumerable benefits in terms of indexing and commenting\
  \ and so on. It was the lack of any helpful method of navigation that led to the\
  \ old site having what was rightly called an \u201CUnhelpful Index\u201D.\nNow,\
  \ through the titanic efforts of Glyn Webster, the 2003\u20132006 Archive has been\
  \ helpfully indexed. Readers can zip to any item at the click of a mouse. This also\
  \ means Mr Key can refer you back to some age-old piece without having to use that\
  \ increasingly annoying instruction to \u201Cgo to the page and scroll down\u201D\
  .\nMr Webster's work is very much appreciated, and it seems all good Yardists ought\
  \ to spend a few days, or weeks, or even months scrubbling around in the Archive\
  \ to dig out their favourites, or to discover things they didn't even know were\
  \ there.\nNOTE\_: The link in the sidebar now directs straight to what Mr Webster\
  \ calls Project \u1E7Abercoordinator. He has also provided this handy diagram:\n\
