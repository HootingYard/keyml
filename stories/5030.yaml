text: "\u201CAt Nashville, where she was exceedingly popular, [Adah Isaacs Menken]\
  \ convinced the theatre manager that Shakespeare was her most appropriate fare,\
  \ and the part of Lady Macbeth one of her shining triumphs. James Murdoch has rewarded\
  \ posterity with an inimitable pen-portrait of Menken seeking to portray the imperious\
  \ consort of Macbeth, without knowledge of the words, or even of the appropriate\
  \ gestures. The day of the performance she came to Murdoch and, with disarming na\xEF\
  vet\xE9 and frankness, confessed that she knew nothing of the part of Lady Macbeth,\
  \ nay had a dread of it, but having told the manager she was equal to any of the\
  \ leading Shakespearean characters, she felt that she must live up to her word.\n\
  \u201CReminded after a preliminary test that not only was she ignorant of the words,\
  \ but altogether lacking in any preconceived idea of the character, Menken brushed\
  \ aside Murdoch's objections with the assurance that all she needed to be shown\
  \ was where the lines had to be emphasised. The embarrassed tragedian did his best\
  \ to oblige. A few hours later the curtain went up, and not only did the intrepid\
  \ actress emerge from the first part of her ordeal without mishap, but scored heavily.\
  \ True she did not give the audience Shakespeare or, for that matter, any known\
  \ playwright, but what she did give them, which was pure unadulterated Menken, sufficed.\
  \ The audience thought her magnificent and elegant. Her exhibition of emotional\
  \ frenzy and regal scorn sent pit and stalls into paroxysms of applause and, although\
  \ Murdoch does not say so, we may take it that the fine dark head stretched in queenly\
  \ command, and those lovely eyes darting contemptuous fire, and that lissom body\
  \ shaken with exaggerated passion, all helped to thrill the audience. Then Menken's\
  \ memory ran out.\n\u201C\u2018From that moment,\u2019 says Murdoch, \u2018Macbeth\
  \ ceased to be the guilty thane and became a mere prompter in Scotch kilt and tartans.\
  \ For the rest of the scene I gave the lady the words! Clinging to my side, in\_\
  \ a manner very different from her former scornful bearing, she took them line by\
  \ line, before she uttered them, still, however, receiving vociferous applause\u2026\
  \ until at length poor Macbeth, who was but playing a \u2018second fiddle\u2019\
  \ to his imperious consort, was glad to make his exit from a scene where the \u2018\
  honours\u2019 were certainly not \u2018even\u2019 \u2018.\nRefreshing her memory\
  \ continuously between the acts, the unbeatable Menken managed to finish the part,\
  \ and the curtain descended upon what must have been the most remarkable performance\
  \ of Lady Macbeth within the memory of any member of the company. With singular\
  \ lack of courage, the management withdrew the play from the bills, forcing Menken\
  \ back into more accustomed r\xF4les.\u201D\nBernard Falk, The Naked Lady, or Storm\
