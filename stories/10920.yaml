text: "The diary of a hallucinating in-patient at the Hoon Hospital, on this day one\
  \ year ago:\nI woke up this morning with a head full of verse\n  And at once I called\
  \ out to the stationery nurse\n  \u201CBring me pencil and paper and pray don't\
  \ delay\n  For I have significant things I must say.\n  In my dreams I've had insights\
  \ both deep and poetic!\u201D\n  But the nurse dosed me up with a powerful emetic\n\
  \  And I vomited my breakfast before I'd even eaten\n  A splurge all eggy and branny\
  \ and wheaten.\n  \u201CLie back,\u201D said the nurse, \u201CLet your ravings cease.\n\
  \  You are in the throes of a terrible disease.\n  That's why you're in hospital,\
  \ you foolish clot.\u201D\n  And she felt my forehead and my forehead was hot.\n\
  \  \u201CBut where is my pencil and where is my jotter?\u201D\n  I cried as my forehead\
  \ grew hotter and hotter\n  Then doctors swept in and prodded my head\n  And I let\
  \ out a groan and sank back on the bed.\n  But inside my brain the verses came teeming\n\
  \  Of Zeinab Badawi, Anna Ford, and Jan Leeming,\n  Of television newsreaders no\
  \ longer seen\n  Reading the news on the television screen,\n  Reginald Bosanquet,\
  \ often drunken and earthy,\n  Where now we have bumptious Krishnan Guru-Murthy.\n\
  \  Then my head emptied out and I fell into swoon\n  In my hospital bed in the clinic\
  \ at Hoon.\n  So the world must cope somehow without my verse\n  Is that a blessing\
  \ or is it a curse?\n  \u201CA blessing for sure\u201D said a voice stern and grim.\n\
  \  \u201CYou're not Dennis Beerpint, you just think you're him.\u201D\n  I woke.\
  \ It was true. I'm not Beerpint at all.\n  I turned to gaze at the white clinic\
  \ wall.\n  Then the nurse announced it was time for my bath\n  \u201CBy the way.\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201CNor are you Sylvia Plath.\u201D\n[2013-01-27]"
