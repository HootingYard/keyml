text: "The blue flag, tatty, at half-mast, indicates to those watching on the shore\
  \ that a shoal is present just beyond the sandbank a quarter of a mile out. The\
  \ green flag is displayed when no shoal can be seen from the helicopters.\nIt can\
  \ be difficult to tell blue from green, at certain times of day, even for those\
  \ without the condition of Daltonism. In milky light, or when a vapour haze descends,\
  \ the colour of the flag might be blue or green or grey to any but the most acute\
  \ observer.\nWork has begun on developing more robust dyes for the flags. Some have\
  \ suggested issuing the watchers on the shore with prismatically-enhanced telescopes.\
  \ Trained cormorants have also been mentioned in a rogue report, although what role\
  \ they would play remains sketchy.\n\u201CThese are testing times,\u201D said a\
  \ brigadier with a great personal investment in shoals. He was supported by those\
  \ who dwell on the sandbank, in cardboard shelters, whose voices are so rarely heard\
  \ above the din.\nDivers, shellists, and the cadets responsible for the darning\
  \ of the flags, are due to appear later in the week.\n[2009-07-15]"
