text: "O let us now sing the praises of noted Swiss puppeteer Rolf Swisspupp! Preferably\
  \ to a free jazz accompaniment, with bongos! Or, on second thoughts, let us not,\
  \ for when we sing it is a godawful caterwauling that sets the teeth on edge and\
  \ makes birds plummet from the sky, stone dead. Instead, let us list some of the\
  \ books which, over the past forty years, the noted Swiss puppeteer has interpreted,\
  \ in dramatic form, in eighteen-hour puppet shows, to adoring audiences in every\
  \ canton of Switzerland.\nThe Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann\nOne Lonely Night by\
  \ Mickey Spillane\nMe And My Ectoplasm by Algernon Spooky\nThe Decline Of The West\
  \ by Oswald Spengler\nChappaquiddick\_: The Real Story by James Lange and K DeWitt\
  \ Jr\nVerbose Twaddle by Will Self\nThe Loch Ness Mystery Solved by Ronald Binns\n\
  The Thing On The Doorstep by H P Lovecraft\nThe Prisoner Of Zenda by Anthony Hope\n\
  The Prisoner Of Brenda by Max D\xE9charn\xE9\nRolf Swisspupp's puppets are made\
  \ from his own secret, patented substance known as Swiss Puppetene\u2122, and this\
  \ gives them an eerily lifelike appearance. In the words of the puppeteering critic\
  \ Horst Puppcrit, \u201Cthese puppets are eerily lifelike, if a few conjoined and\
  \ twisted pipe-cleaners and a knob of putty can be imbued with life\u201D.\nThe\
  \ puppets are mute, chiefly because Rolf Swisspupp's voicebox was surgically removed\
  \ following a traumatic childhood ice-skating accident. The sheer dramatic intensity\
  \ of his productions is made all the more sheer and dramatic and intense by the\
  \ resounding silence in which they are performed. Dropped pins, etcetera.\nIn person,\
  \ Rolf Swisspupp has a haunted and ravaged appearance, which has led to rumours\
  \ that, when he is alone with his puppets, they come to life and torment him, as\
  \ Michael Redgrave was tormented by his ventriloquist's dummy in the film Dead Of\
  \ Night (1945). Certainly it is true that the Swiss puppeteer has been found on\
  \ occasion staggering through the streets of Zurich and Lucerne and Winterthur and\
  \ Geneva, drink-sodden and incontinent.\nBut if he is a tragic figure, he is also\
  \ enormously popular with Swiss tinies, who clap their little hands and screech\
  \ with joy at the mere mention of his name. So if, today, we do not sing his praises,\
  \ we can screech them, like a small overtired Swiss child, screech and screech and\
  \ screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech\
  \ and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech until we are carted\
  \ off and confined to a remote Swiss facility, high in the Alps, where brutish orderlies\
  \ will torment us with pipe-cleaners and knobs of putty.\n[2016-01-10]"
