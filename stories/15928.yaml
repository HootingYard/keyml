text: "Lars and Maud went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.\n  Lars fell down\
  \ and clonked his crown and Maud came tumbling after.\n  They rolled and tumbled\
  \ further down, tumbling pell mell,\n  \u2018Til they came bumping to a halt down\
  \ in the dingly dell.\n  In the dell lurked the Grunty Man, who carried them off\
  \ to his cave.\n  But fear not, tinies! For Lars was bold and Maud was very brave.\n\
  \  They shook their little fists and bawled and rent the sky asunder,\n  And made\
  \ the Grunty Man commit a very foolish blunder.\n  He dropped them at the cave-mouth\
  \ while he went to have a fight,\n  An illegal boxing match under the cover of the\
  \ night.\n  The Grunty Man was pitted \u2018gainst an awful, dreadful foe \u2013\
  \n  None other than Miss Peep, affectionately known as \u201CLittle Bo\u201D.\n\
  \  She looked so pale and timorous, yet she packed a hefty punch,\n  And often bashed\
  \ a dozen ogres before she had her lunch.\n  So when the Grunty Man stalked off\
  \ to meet his Nemesis,\n  Lars and Maud ran off into the arms of Alger Hiss.\n \
  \ Yes, Alger Hiss, the communist spy from Washington DC!\n  Urbane and droll and\
  \ stylish, dressed up to a T.\n  He took the tots to a meeting of his fellow-travelling\
  \ Reds,\n  Where Stalinist propaganda turned their pointy little heads.\n  They\
  \ went back to the cave and found the Grunty Man covered in gore.\n  Little Bo Peep\
  \ had bashed him up, then bashed him up some more.\n  They recruited him to their\
  \ cause, to overthrow the state.\n  Said Lars (or Maud) \u201CWe must act before\
  \ it is too late!\u201D\n  So Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man went back to the\
  \ dingly dell,\n  And hid some microfilmed secrets at the bottom of the well.\n\
  \  But they were caught by Nixon, indefatigable in his zest\n  To place as many\
  \ Reds as possible under house arrest.\n  He confined them to a house atop the hill\
  \ they climbed for water,\n  A solid and a sturdy house well built from bricks and\
  \ mortar,\n  Like the house of the three little pigs that withstood lupine huff\
  \ and puff.\n  But Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man were Communists, sure enough.\n\
  \  So when the big bad wolf hove into view from o'er the hills,\n  They sang in\
  \ praise of Stalin and then swallowed their cyanide pills.\n  And so the state was\
  \ safe once more from Communist infiltration,\n  And Nixon was bathed in the praise\
  \ of a relieved and grateful nation.\n  The Grunty Man and Lars and Maud were buried\
  \ and forgot.\n  But Richard Milhous Nixon\u2014he is not.\nOriginally posted in\
