text: "Frank Key today answered mounting speculation about the nature of his new project\
  \ and announced Dobsonmore, a unique and free-to-use website which builds an exciting\
  \ online experience around the reading of his hugely successful Dobson piffle, and\
  \ is partnered by Blodgett Global Domination Enterprises GmbH.\nThe announcement\
  \ today was heralded by the revealing of the website's name via an online search\
  \ for its letters, and a \u2018coming soon\u2019 holding page which received over\
  \ 36 visits within a million hours of launching.\nFor this groundbreaking collaborative\
  \ project, Frank Key has written extensive new material about Dobson, his pamphlets,\
  \ and his boots, which will inform, inspire and entertain readers as they journey\
  \ through the storylines of the piffle. Dobsonmore will later incorporate an online\
  \ shop where people can purchase exclusively the long-awaited Dobson ePamphlets\
  \ (out of e-print), in partnership with Frank Key's publishers worldwide, and is\
  \ ultimately intended to become an online reading experience, extending the relevance\
  \ of Dobson to new generations of readers, while still appealing to existing fans.\
  \ As the Dobsonmore Shop develops, it is intended that it should include further\
  \ products designed specifically for Dobson fans, offering a potential outlet for\
  \ Blodgett Global Domination Enterprises GmbH products and services related to Dobsonmore.\
  \ In keeping with Dobson's international appeal, the site will launch in English,\
  \ Afrikaans, Ugric, Ket, Generic BBC Drama Peasant, and Glosa, with more languages\
  \ to follow.\nIn the new website, the storyline will be brought to life with sumptuous\
  \ newly-commissioned illustrations and interactive \u2018Moments\u2019 through which\
  \ you can navigate, starting with the first appearance of Dobson bent over his escritoire,\
  \ scribbling. On entering, you choose a foolish username and begin your experience.\
  \ As you move through the chapters, you can read and share exclusive writing from\
  \ Frank Key, and, just as Dobson barges through the door of his dilapidated hovel,\
  \ so can you. You visit Pointy Town, get sorted into a chalet, write pamphlets and\
  \ chuck pebbles at swans\u2026\nThat's quite enough of a rewritten press release\
  \ to be going on with.\n[2011-06-23]"
