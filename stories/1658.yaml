text: "A couple of comments at the hectic Caucasian Lullaby discussion reminded me\
  \ about Charles Babbage and his hatred of \u201Cstreet disturbances\u201D. This\
  \ was the subject of a brief snippet posted here as long ago as 19\_January 2004.\
  \ I thought I would dig it out of the archive and reproduce it here. Much to my\
  \ annoyance, I failed to identify the source of my quotations, and now I cannot\
  \ recall where I read them. Very slapdash.\nWhen he wasn't inventing the computer,\
  \ Charles Babbage spent much of his time getting het up about what he called \u201C\
  street disturbances\u201D. These seem to have consisted almost entirely of what\
  \ most people call \u201Cmusic\u201D. He wrote a helpful list of \u201Cinstruments\
  \ of torture permitted by the Government to be in daily and nightly use in the streets\
  \ of London\u201D:\nOrgans, Bagpipes, Brass bands, Accordians, Fiddlers, Halfpenny\
  \ whistles, Harps, Tom-toms, Harpsichords, Trumpets, Hurdy-gurdies, Shouting out\
  \ objects for sale, Flageolets, Religious canting, Drums, Psalm-singing.\nAnd apart\
  \ from the Government, responsible for allowing this mayhem, Babbage knew who to\
  \ blame: \u201CTavern-keepers, Public-houses, Girl-shops, Beer-shops, Coffee-shops,\
  \ Servants, Children, Visitors from the country, Ladies of doubtful virtue, Occasionally\
  \ titled ladies; but these are almost invariably of recent elevation, and deficient\
  \ in that taste which their sex usually possess\u201D.\n[2009-02-06]"
