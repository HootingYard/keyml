text: "I am a Bible-basher. I bash my Bible. Usually, I bash it with my fists, bare-knuckled.\
  \ Sometimes I wear boxing gloves. Occasionally I will give it a few hefty thumps\
  \ with a rubber sap weighted with lead, more commonly deployed down dark alleyways\
  \ by miscreants wearing trenchcoats in films noir. Or, if I am having one of my\
  \ fits of hysteria, I will bash my Bible with whatever comes to hand, such as a\
  \ plank of wood, a hammer, or a police truncheon. I am retired from the force now,\
  \ but I still have a few truncheons lying around the flat here and there.\nIt happens\
  \ from time to time that the din I create when bashing my Bible disturbs my downstairs\
  \ neighbours. I am not sure if the ground floor flat is some kind of suburban seminary,\
  \ but it is riddled with priests. Every so often one of them will come upstairs\
  \ and reproach me. They let themselves in, being in possession of a set of keys\
  \ to both my flat and my soul. It pains me that they think there is something sacrilegious\
  \ in my bashing.\nLetting fall my truncheon, or taking off my boxing gloves, or\
  \ one of the other alternatives, as it may be, I try to explain to the priest what\
  \ I am about. This bashing, I say, is done in a spirit of piety and devotion to\
  \ Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments. Invariably, no matter which of the priests\
  \ has come up, there follows a theological debate so abstruse and hermetic and pernickety\
  \ that you would not have a clue what I was talking about if I tried to summarise\
  \ it in words of one syllable.\nWhat I find most mysterious is that these debates\
  \ are repeated every few days, with one or another of the downstairs priests, whenever\
  \ I get a bit carried away bashing my Bible and make my floor, their ceiling, shake.\
  \ Do they not talk to each other, down in their ground floor flat full of crucifixes\
  \ and prayer books and censers? Do they never compare notes regarding the pious\
  \ retired police officer upstairs whose devotion to Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments\
  \ is, at times, as I freely admit, maniacal? Do they not run through the theological\
  \ debates and try to work out, among themselves, a method of defeating my compelling\
  \ if abstruse logic? It seems they do not.\nThings go a little differently with\
  \ my upstairs neighbour, a voodoo worshipper whose terrifying devotions make an\
  \ even greater racket than my bashing. But I do not reproach her. In fact, I have\
  \ even offered to do her ironing for her. I am keen for her to take up my offer,\
  \ one day, for then I will iron her voodoo robes and gowns in such a way as to reproduce\
  \ precisely the creases and crumplings of Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments\u2019\
  \ vestments. And one more soul may be saved for Christ.\n[2014-02-05]"
