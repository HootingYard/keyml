text: "In my first book \u201CGHOSTLY GIFTS\u201D I related some of the earlier cases\
  \ where I uncovered physical objects in the presence of witnesses. Since then my\
  \ talent has developed greatly and I travel around the Isle of Wight seeking out\
  \ these unhappy souls whose greed, foolishness, jealousy or other sins have held\
  \ them prisoners without chains waiting for release.\nI may be busy at home going\
  \ about my daily chores, dusting, ironing or one of the many jobs a housewife performs\
  \ when a voice speaks and tells me to go to a certain place where someone needs\
  \ help. The voice I hear is one of my spirit guides. I then have to make suitable\
  \ arrangements with one of my small team of helpers who provide me with transport\
  \ as I have no car to travel to the place I have been told. I may not have a hazardous\
  \ or rich social life but it is certainly never dull as I set forth upon these journeys\
  \ not knowing what story I shall hear and what I may be led to find. All I need\
  \ are willing helpers, a pencil and paper because as soon as I hear a ghostly voice\
  \ speak I write down every word in strange writing at great speed, the pencil never\
  \ leaves the paper so that each word is joined to the next. My helpers usually arm\
  \ themselves with some tool to dig with and we all wear old clothes as ghosts seem\
  \ to have a habit of leading us through mud and bogs or making us crawl under barbed\
  \ wire, through thick brambles, scramble down cliffs or push aside a herd of cows!\n\
