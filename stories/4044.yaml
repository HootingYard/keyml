text: "Disconcerted by days of unaccustomed silence at Hooting Yard, boffins have\
  \ been poking and prodding at Mr Key's pea-sized yet pulsating brain, trying to\
  \ account for the lack of activity.\n\u201CWhat we have gleaned,\u201D said one,\
  \ a particularly astute and beardy boffin, \u201Cis that our beloved Mr Key has\
  \ had his head buried in books for the past few days, interspersed with certain\
  \ hiking adventures in high winds. This has diverted his attention, as both writer\
  \ and reader, from the exciting 21st century world of blogs and blogging. We have\
  \ recommended that to snap him out of his silence, he is to be sent for a few days\
  \ to his glorious Motherland\u2014that is, Belgium\u2014in the hope that upon his\
  \ return he will start tippy-tapping away as he usually does. Word has it that he\
  \ may yet be ready to unleash a series of rattling yarns about Alger Hiss and Whittaker\
  \ Chambers. It is unclear whether these tales will be based on historical fact,\
  \ or whether Mr Key intends simply to make use of the names for a fictional \u2018\
  dismal duo\u2019. Either way, we shall all look forward to some mighty prose issuing\
  \ from the Key cranium when it has been refreshed by the Flanders air.\u201D\n[2010-03-10]"
