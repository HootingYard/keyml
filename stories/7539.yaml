text: "The text of today's lesson is taken from Fingers by Oswell Blakeston, Chapter\
  \ 4, Paragraph 16:\nHe glanced at Sir Richard Dickie, in fear that the bird might\
  \ have changed into a charging ostrich of fire.\nHow common is it that, behind our\
  \ backs, when we are not looking, a cage-bird, such as a budgerigar or a canary,\
  \ turns into a charging ostrich of fire?\nIn all honesty, the answer must be \u201C\
  very rarely\u201D or \u201CI have never known such a thing to happen, in all my\
  \ days\u201D. For one thing, those who know their ornithology will know that the\
  \ ostrich is a much larger bird than either the budgerigar or the canary, and would\
  \ not fit into the average domestic birdcage. Thus, if by magic, some comparatively\
  \ tiny cage-bird transformed itself into an ostrich, it would do itself a mischief,\
  \ break some bones, and possibly even be suffocated as it became an ostrich, confined\
  \ within a cage too small to hold it.\nAgainst this, one could argue two things.\
  \ If the cage was constructed from flimsy materials, it might be that the burgeoning\
  \ ostrich would simply cause the birdcage to fall to bits around it as it expanded\
  \ in size from budgerigar or canary to full ostrichdom. Or, bear in mind that Blakeston\
  \ specifically describes an ostrich of fire. Would not the enflamed and blazing\
  \ bird burn the cage to cinders as it underwent its transformation?\nThus, however\
  \ unlikely the event, we must concede its possibility. But what would cause an ostrich\
  \ to burst into flame? If anything, such a fate is more likely to visit a canary,\
  \ for once upon a time canaries in their thousands perched in cages hung from the\
  \ rafters of coal mines, to act as detectors of noxious fumes and gases. If the\
  \ miners did not notice that a canary had choked on escaping gas and toppled from\
  \ its perch, or indeed even if they did notice, an explosion might occur in the\
  \ mine and the canary be consumed by fire.\nOstriches, being so much bigger than\
  \ canaries, would prove an impediment to miners down a pit, so one cannot imagine\
  \ them facing the same awful fiery death as the tinier birds. But then consider\
  \ the ostrich's notorious tendency to swallow the most unlikely of materials. One\
  \ twentieth-century ostrich, for example, was found to have ingested a lace handkerchief,\
  \ a buttoned glove, a length of rope, a plain handkerchief (probably a man's), assorted\
  \ copper coins, metal tacks, staples and hooks, and a four-inch nail. With that\
  \ kind of diet, one can well imagine the addition of combustible items, and an agency\
  \ of combustion.\nSo we see, too, that the idea of an ostrich of fire is not so\
  \ far-fetched. As for its charging, that would be a perfectly instinctual reaction\
  \ to a bird finding itself aflame. Whether it would find a pond or lake in which\
  \ to douse and extinguish the flames in the kind of domestic parlour in which Oswell\
  \ Blakeston's cage-bird Sir Richard Dickie finds itself is another matter entirely.\
  \ Though I suppose one can imagine it charging out of the parlour and into the kitchen,\
  \ towards the kitchen sink, or up the staircase and into the bathroom, towards the\
  \ bath. Then it would have to hope that the kitchen sink or the bath were full of\
  \ standing water, for I am not sure ostriches, which are reportedly particularly\
  \ stupid birds, would have the wherewithal to insert the plug in the plughole and\
  \ turn on the taps, with their talons.\nThus we can see that having resolved some\
  \ of the difficulties posed by the passage, we are not wholly in the clear. There\
  \ remain insoluble problems. As, perhaps, in life, there ever will be. Let us now\
  \ sing a hymn.\n[2011-11-07]"
