text: "\nPeter Sarstedt famously asked \u201CWhere do you go to, my lovely, when you're\
  \ alone in your bed?\u201D The simple answer to this question is that his lovely\
  \ is not going anywhere. She is in bed, quite possibly asleep. Why, then, would\
  \ the singer\u2014whose first wife was a dentist\u2014pose the query in the first\
  \ place?\nWe can posit several solutions to this conundrum, and it is well worth\
  \ doing so, for reasons which ought to be obvious\u2014and obvious not only to the\
  \ spouses of dentists, but to the general population also.\nOne theory, propounded\
  \ by veteran Sarstedtist Loopy Tinhat, is that the question mark ought to appear\
  \ after \u201Cmy lovely\u201D, and that \u201Cwhen you're alone in your bed\u201D\
  \ is a new, separate sentence, the beginning of a rumination quite distinct from\
  \ the opening query. In this reading, Sarstedt is about to make certain observations\
  \ regarding his lovely in her bed, but he is interrupted before he is able to complete\
  \ the sentence. Tinhat suggests the singer spoke from the dentist's chair, when\
  \ his wife was about to perform a tooth extraction, and told him to \u201Copen wide\u201D\
  \ just as he uttered the word \u201Cbed\u201D.\nTinhat's theory won broad support\
  \ among the my lovely community until it was comprehensively demolished by researcher\
  \ Lars Welk. Using dental records, slowed-down tape recordings, and a fiercely forensic\
  \ brain, Welk demonstrated beyond sensible argument that Tinhat had no idea what\
  \ he was talking about.\nMore persuasive, perhaps, is the argument laid out over\
  \ several coruscating paragraphs by Ned Cakeboy in a paper published in The Journal\
  \ Of Dental Hygiene & Sarstedt Studies, Vol XXIV No. 11. Pointing out that, just\
  \ as doctors get sick and require the ministrations of other doctors, so dentists\
  \ call on other dentists to faff about with their teeth when necessary. He goes\
  \ on to claim that the bed in which my lovely is alone is a hospital bed, on wheels\
  \ or casters. She is about to undergo particularly complex dental treatment, and\
  \ has been wheeled, in her bed, from her ward to a dental operating theatre. Peter\
  \ Sarstedt, paying a visit to his dentist lovely born of uxoriousness, armed probably\
  \ with a bouquet of flowers, arrives at the dental hospital to discover that she\
  \ is not, as he supposed, in her ward. Where did she go to?, he wonders.\nI said\
  \ there were several possible solutions to account for the singer asking such a\
  \ seemingly stupid question, and I have tackled two of them. That is quite enough\
  \ for the time being. In any case, these matters become decidedly more baffling\
  \ when we consider that Sarstedt's second wife was not a dentist.\n[2018-03-31]"
