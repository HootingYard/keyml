text: "Given that it was published in 1970, Bernard Levin's The Pendulum Years\_:\
  \ Britain In The Sixties is a remarkably clear-sighted view of the decade, and most\
  \ of his observations and conclusions would hold good even with the benefit of forty\
  \ years\u2019 hindsight. But pop music (sorry, make that \u201Cpop-music\u201D)\
  \ was not exactly Levin's strong point, though he makes a tremendous effort to address\
  \ the phenomenon\u2026\n\nThe growth of pop-music groups\u2014many, no doubt, inspired\

  \ phenomenon in the world of entertainment of the whole decade; long before its\
  \ end there were literally thousands of them, in Britain and America, and though\
  \ many flourished only briefly, many displayed surprising endurance, and in any\
  \ case there were always ten to take the place of one which fell. Some were almost\
  \ as famous, and successful, as the Beatles; some were known only to the most devoted\
  \ aficionados. But all added to the atmosphere of the decade, and the isle was full\
  \ of noises as never before, coming from, among others, the Rolling Stones, the\
