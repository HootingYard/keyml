  \ of art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker, \u201Cit is a bold, transgressive, edgy work,\
  \ interrogating notions of authenticity, desire, and jouissance while incorporating\
  \ both dippiness and a Playmobil figure holding a vacuum cleaner under some streamers.\
  \ If it was for sale, I would pay millions for it.\u201D\n\nIt is not for sale.\n\
