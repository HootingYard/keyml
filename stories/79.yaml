text: "If you have ever spent a weekend with an owl god, you will know that it can\
  \ be a character-building experience. I have vivid memories of the time Chalchiuhtecolotl,\
  \ the night owl god of the Aztecs, made itself at home in my flat for three trying\
  \ days. I live in a glitzy and gleaming block, of futuristic design, impossibly\
  \ stark, with lots of exciting remote control hubs, but the fact is it is small,\
  \ even pokey, and it doesn't help that I have crammed into it the contents of my\
  \ ma's laboratory and my pa's garden shed, together with much of the furniture thrown\
  \ out when the local vet refurbished his waiting room and a jumble of junk from\
  \ a hellhole.\nThat Friday evening I was crumpled on a settee, eating lemon meringue\
  \ pie and reading Pebblehead's bestselling paperback Brute Beauty And Valour And\
  \ Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle! when the front door sensor vibrated,\
  \ the hub hummed, and the plasma display flashed insistently. I had a visitor, though\
  \ no one was expected. Thinking it might be a goon coming to serve me with an Asbo,\
  \ I depressed the locking knob on the entry pod, put down my pie plate, and tiptoed\
  \ my way through some of ma's alembics to the door. Peering through the tintin slat,\
  \ I saw a hunched and somewhat shabby figure dressed like a bus conductor, if you\
  \ can remember bus conductors. He\u2014I thought it was a he\u2014was not holding\
  \ anything that might be an Asbo, so, being an affable sort, I opened the door.\n\
  He\u2014or rather, it\u2014almost knocked me over as it somehow soared past me and\
  \ came to rest next to the settee. Before either of us spoke, it plucked my plate\
  \ off the floor and scoffed what was left of the lemon meringue pie. Then it said:\n\
  \u201CGood evening. I am an Aztec god. My name is Chalchiuhtecolotl and I am an\
  \ owl god. Of the night.\u201D\n\u201CYou look like a bus conductor,\u201D I replied,\
  \ \u201CAnd a shabby one at that.\u201D\nThen it screeched at me. It was the loudest\
  \ and longest screech I have ever had the misfortune to hear. My ears did not stop\
  \ ringing until Sunday lunchtime, by which time the owl god had completely taken\
  \ over my life. Within the confines of my fab but tiny flat, it swooped, it pecked\
  \ at things, it shifted shape, it did some strange rewiring manipulations to my\
  \ stereo system, it fluttered and preened, it fixed me for hours with a cold inhuman\
  \ stare, it sprouted tufts and feathers, it would not let me read my Pebblehead\
  \ paperback, it hawked up gobbets of semi-digested pie, it smashed all ma's lab\
  \ equipment to smithereens, then ate the smithereens, it shifted shape again, it\
  \ summoned some of its Aztec god pals and held a rowdy Saturday night party, it\
  \ kept me awake by looming menacingly just out of sight, it filled the bath with\
  \ wounded mice and stoats and weasels, it made me sit through a four-hour documentary\
  \ about Spandau Ballet, its metabolism speeded up to the point where everything\
  \ in the flat was shaking, it phoned up my friends and told them I had moved to\
  \ Dawlish, it somehow managed to drag a live swan into the bathroom and savaged\
  \ it with its talons, it screeched and screeched, drowning out the Shipping Forecast,\
  \ it burned its bright incandescent fury into my soul, and on Monday morning it\
  \ shape-shifted again, just as it was pulverising my bread bin, and turned back\
  \ into what looked like a shabby bus conductor.\n\u201CI am leaving you now,\u201D\
  \ it said, and it sounded almost regretful. I watched it leave, and slumped on what\
  \ was left of the settee. I took a nap, and then I went to see the priest to explain\
  \ to him that I was renouncing the Roman Catholic faith, forever. He tried to lure\
  \ me into the confessional box, but I threatened to tear his beating heart out of\
  \ his chest and make an offering of it to That Mighty Orb, the Sun. That shut him\
  \ up. I sashayed off through the glittering streets, past Pang Hill Orphanage and\
  \ across Sawdust Bridge, towards glory.\n[2007-02-25]"
