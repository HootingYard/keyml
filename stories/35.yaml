  \ Yard's Best Title Of A Film About Bees Made Within The Last Five Years. We only\
  \ make this award after a rigorous selection process, fuelled by many, many cups\
  \ of piping hot tea in Mrs Gubbins\u2019 space-age kitchenette parlour.\nI am delighted\
  \ to announce that the 2007 Award goes to William Bishop-Stephens for Bee Control\
  \ In City Parks. He wins a toffee apple with bite marks which, a dentist tells me,\
  \ could well have been made by fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol immediately after\
  \ he won the 1966 Blister Lane Bypass Sprint Hurdles Cup And Saucer in a then record\
  \ time of eight hours, sixteen minutes and forty-four seconds.\nWell done, Will,\
  \ and I am sure all Hooting Yard readers will take the opportunity to watch your\
  \ splendid film.\n[2007-02-08]"
