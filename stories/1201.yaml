  It is said that most have been sites of human settlements for thousands of years,
  which is a bit perplexing, as the canal itself was only dug two centuries ago. The
  hospital barge plies up and down the canal constantly, turning when it gets to Mudberth
  and heading straight back to Muckfield, never stopping except at locks. There are
  many locks. When a villager or hamleteer is sick, they are carted to the canalside
  by their neighbours and hauled aboard the hospital barge by a steam-powered crane-and-stretcher-and-pincer
  contraption. Once they have been cured, if they are cured, they are dumped ashore
  at the next village or hamlet, and have to make their own way home by land, unless,
  as is common, they choose to remain in the village or hamlet where they have been
  dumped, and thus do the canalside communities intermingle.

  The hospital barge is staffed by a gaggle of homeopaths and healers and fraudsters
  and quacks, and the dispensary holds shelf after shelf packed with pointless potions
  such as Bach flower remedies and Beethoven weed remedies and Bruckner nettle remedies.
  There is not a single bottle of Baxter''s Sour But Invigorating Syrup to be found,
  let alone any cranial integument soothers or antibiotics. It is a wonder that any
  of the patients are ever cured, but in fairness it must be said that those dumped
  ashore at a village or hamlet miles up or down the canal from where they were winched
  aboard the barge show remarkable perkiness, and in many cases appear to be immortal.
  In the village of Filthwick, for example, no one has died in the last sixty years,
  and the gymnasium is filled with sprightly one-hundred-and-fifty-year-olds jumping
  about and springing and bounding and hopping and somersaulting and otherwise engaging
  in decidedly energetic calisthenics.

  This being the canal along the towpath of which Dobson often trudged, the out of
  print pamphleteer could hardly resist writing about the hospital barge. But he wanted
  more than the view of a disinterested observer, and waited to fall sick so he could
  go aboard the barge as a patient. Alas, Dobson had the constitution of a large,
  sinewy, more or less rectangular animal with no known predators, and never suffered
  illness. He became impatient, standing on the canal towpath watching the hospital
  barge pass him by, occasionally witnessing the winching on of an agued wreck or
  the dumping of a revivified Pointy Towner. Eventually, the pamphleteer could wait
  no longer, and he took the fateful step of injecting himself with an experimental
  serum concocted by one of his pals down at the Cow & Pins. The fizzing hissing dapple-dun
  fluid smelled of rust and blood oranges, and was meant to cause harmless shuddering
  with all the appearance of a death rattle. In Dobson it had an alarmingly different
  effect, in that it provoked a mental imbalance making him petrified of boats and
  ships and yachts and barges, so much so that at the sight of water, even of a duckpond,
  he ran away screaming.

  A fortnight later, when the serum wore off, Dobson learned through an article in
  the Canalside Gazette that the hospital barge had been rendered invisible. It, and
  its crew of homeopaths and healers and fraudsters and quacks, and its on-board patients,
  were never seen again, and nor were the many, many dead who had never been cured
  upon the barge, and whose final resting places are an unutterable mystery.
