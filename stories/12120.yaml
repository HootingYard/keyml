text: "\u2018Twas brillig, and I babbled guff\n  Until my listeners cried \u201CEnough!\u201D\
  \n  And stopped my gob with a plug of dough\n  And then it was that I knew woe.\n\
  A woe such as I'd never known\n  Not e'en when I was skin and bone\n  In starveling\
  \ days of pimply youth\n  Before I grew so fat forsooth\nFat and loud and babbling\
  \ guff\n  All roister doister swagger and puff\n  Puffed up like one of those eerie\
  \ toads\n  That leap at you from beside the roads\nWell, at least, they leap at\
  \ moi\n  I wrote of them in my memoir\n  The text of which is what I brayed\n  Hoping\
  \ to make my listeners afraid\nInstead they plugged my gob with dough\n  And brought\
  \ me down so very low\n  That now my life is full of woe\n  And it is time for me\
  \ to go\nGo where? To the seaside I suppose\n  To my seaside chalet o\u2019 prose\n\
  \  To thump my typewriter's leaden keys\n  And write of hornets, wasps, and bees\n\
