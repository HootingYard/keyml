text: "Greetings, Ephesians! How are things in Ephesus? Better, I hope, than they\
  \ are here at Haemoglobin Towers, where we are having terrible troubles, including\
  \ an infestation of pipistrelle bats, a plague of locusts, a dog in a manger, mange\
  \ on our turnips, an outbreak of scrofula, gluten intolerance, incursions by barbarians,\
  \ hot flushes, cold sores, ungainly hat angles, foopball hooliganism, unearthly\
  \ manifestations of the ghost of Googie Withers, and more general withers of our\
  \ googie and our boogie and our jazz-funk groove. We have all that to contend with,\
  \ Ephesians, while you lot are no doubt sprawled on your Ephesian divans in Ephesus,\
  \ gobbling grapes and swigging tumblers of intoxicant fluids and having a debauched\
  \ time of it.\nAnyway, the reason I am writing is that I hope to escape from the\
  \ several horrors swirling about Haemoglobin Towers and have booked a charabanc\
  \ to Ephesus, leaving from the bus station at Sawdust Bridge next Tuesday at noon,\
  \ or nearish to noon. But I do not have anywhere to stay when eventually I arrive\
  \ in Ephesus, assuming I do arrive and do not perish from poisoning by the fumes\
  \ of the charabanc, which is old and clackety and has not, so far as I know, passed\
  \ any of the rigorous vehicle safety tests one might hope it had.\nStill, I must\
  \ keep my pecker up and stride boldly into the future without worrying my little\
  \ head too much about expiring from noxious vapours. So if we assume I will turn\
  \ up at the bus station in Ephesus at some point, is there anybody among you Ephesians\
  \ who could put me up in a chalet, or a room, or a tent, or even on a picnic blanket\
  \ open to the elements? I am afraid I am penniless, and cannot pay a sou by way\
  \ of rent, but I will happily entertain my hosts by singing lustily to the accompaniment\
  \ of a piccolo. I have a repertoire of several pieces, cover versions mostly, including\
  \ my own \u201Cinterpretations\u201D (for want of a better word) of Vienna by Ultravox,\
  \ Dr Bogenbroom by Jethro Tull, and The Poem of Ecstasy by Alexander Scriabin, whose\
  \ hands, incidentally, were as tiny as my head is tiny, proportionately speaking,\
  \ if that means anything concrete, which upon examination it probably does not,\
  \ but then I am having difficulty concentrating as in addition to all the other\
  \ troubles listed above there is now a swarm of wasps outside my window, desperately\
  \ trying to find its way in to my ill-appointed boudoir.\nOh, and one more thing,\
  \ Ephesians. The charabanc driver has just informed me that he has absolutely no\
  \ idea how to get to Ephesus, so if one among you could provide simple directions,\
  \ so simple that even a dimwit could understand them, that would be dandy! Grace\
  \ be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.\n[2014-11-19]"
