  \ casting a frank and unstinting* gaze upon the creative process involved in the\
  \ writing of the masterpiece that is\_Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke.\_\_Mention\
  \ of which reminds me that, several days after publication, there may be one or\
  \ two readers in far-flung corners of the earth who have not yet bought copies.\
  \ You know who you are. Zip thyselves o'er to Lulu and make purchase now, tardy\
  \ ones!\n* NOTE\_: \u201CUnstinting\u201D, in this context, means \u201Cnot involving\
  \ at any stage the participation of a stint\u201D. As any fule kno, a stint is a\
  \ type of bird, specifically a very small wader known in North America as a peep.\
  \ They can be difficult to identify because of the similarity between species, and\
  \ various breeding, non-breeding, juvenile and moulting plumages, but you shouldn't\
  \ let that stop you.\n\n\n[2011-07-29]"
