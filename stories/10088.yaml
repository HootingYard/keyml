text: "Though his mighty brain confounded mere mortals, Sherlock Holmes was, of course,\
  \ a dimwit in comparison with his brother Mycroft. Something similar may be said\
  \ about Blossom Partridge and her sister Flossie.\nBlossom is best-known as editrix\
  \ of Miss Blossom Partridge's Weekly Digest, quite possibly the finest weekly digest\
  \ on this or any other planet. It remains, defiantly, a printed paper publication,\
  \ though one feels sure that if Blossom ever countenanced the idea of going online,\
  \ she would wipe the floor with the ghastly Arianna Huffington or with Tina Brown\
  \ of the Daily Beast. Not the least of the charms of the Weekly Digest is that it\
  \ is hand-written in Blossom's immaculate copperplate and the copies duplicated\
  \ on an ancient and creaking Gestetner machine. Blossom also refuses to acknowledge\
  \ the horrors of decimalisation and the cover price has been held at 4d. By any\
  \ measure she is a marvel of marvels among women.\nYet she would be first to bow\
  \ to the even greater marvellousness of her sister. Flossie Partridge is a balloonist,\
  \ aviatrix, explorer, inventor, secret agent, government spy, and the Lord knows\
  \ what else besides. She could serve as a role model for any aspiring International\
  \ Woman of Mystery, did she not remain almost entirely hidden from the public gaze.\
  \ What little we know about her is thanks to hints dropped by Blossom in her magazine.\n\
  For example, Blossom has written movingly about the rare times the sisters spend\
  \ together, when \u201Cwe never walk like other people: we skip and gambol to show\
  \ how girlish we are, as if we were Goosie and Piggy Antrobus\u201D. She alludes\
  \ to some of Flossie's more hair-raising adventures in her regular \u201CGlimpses\
  \ of Flossie's Hair-Raising Adventures\u201D column, without ever going into the\
  \ sort of detail that might compromise her sister's obsessive, indeed maniacal,\
  \ desire for secrecy. Thus, we might be afforded a \u201Cglimpse\u201D of Flossie\
  \ inventing a new serum, or in hand-to-hand combat with a giant anaconda, but we\
  \ will not be told the purpose or recipe of the serum, nor the rationale or location\
  \ of the death-struggle. Nor, incidentally, does Blossom divulge how one might engage\
  \ in hand-to-hand combat with a beast that has no hands, though by omitting an explanation\
  \ she guarantees a bulging postbag of readers\u2019 letters.\nRegular readers of\
  \ the Weekly Digest will be aware that in virtually every issue, the \u201CDear\
  \ Miss Partridge\u201D letters page includes a lengthy, demented, and hysterical\
  \ screed from a certain I. Alfred Pigtosser. Occasionally, Mr Pigtosser might address\
  \ a topic raised in an earlier issue; more often, however, his letter will be a\
  \ bitter and venomous harangue, barely coherent, shading at times into outright\
  \ madness. Blossom has stated that it is her policy never to cut or otherwise edit\
  \ her readers\u2019 letters, and so there are times when a Pigtosser letter takes\
  \ up six- or seven-eighths of the entire magazine. Readers complain, but Blossom\
  \ remains unruffled.\nIt has not escaped the notice of her more astute readers that\
  \ \u201CI. Alfred Pigtosser\u201D is an anagram of \u201CFlossie Partridge\u201D\
  . Could it be, they ask, incredulously, that this poisonous invective is the work\
  \ of the editrix's marvellous sister? To which Blossom has responded by publishing\
  \ grainy black-and-white photographs purporting to show Mr Pigtosser as an infant,\
  \ on a tricycle, in a sailor's suit, next to a large swan. She does not say how\
  \ she came by these snaps, nor provide evidence of the (blurred) infant's identity.\
  \ On the other hand, Blossom is such a marvellous woman that she would surely not\
  \ try to pull the wool over her readers\u2019 eyes. It is a conundrum to be sure.\n\
  Speaking of wool, another of the regular features in the Weekly Digest is \u201C\
  Miss Blossom Partridge's Woolly Blather\u201D. Here one might find adventurous knitting\
  \ projects, crochet extravaganzas, and disquisitions upon good wool and bad wool.\
  \ Every now and then, the \u201CWoolly Blather\u201D and \u201CGlimpses of Flossie's\
  \ Hair-Raising Adventures\u201D columns are combined into one, as a surprising number\
  \ of Flossie's hair-raising adventures have involved wool in some form or other.\
  \ One thinks of the incident when Flossie was engaged in hand-to-hand combat with\
  \ a giant anaconda which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be an extensive\
  \ draught-excluding sausage knitted entirely from the wool of a merino sheep. Blossom,\
  \ with her typical editorial dash, appended a pattern so readers could knit their\
  \ own. As if to provide fuel for the conspiracy theorists, the article prompted\
  \ a letter from I. Alfred Pigtosser so lengthy, and mad, that it completely filled\
  \ the next three issues of the magazine.\nAs far as is known, Flossie Partridge\
  \ has never published a single word under her own name. Presumably she is too busy\
  \ ballooning, flying aeroplanes, exploring, inventing, engaged on secret missions,\
  \ spying for the government, and the Lord knows what else besides ever to find time\
  \ to put pen to paper. Blossom has said, however, that once, when she and her sister\
  \ were skipping and gambolling girlishly o'er the green to dance around a maypole,\
  \ Flossie let slip that she kept a daily diary. It is said to run to thousands upon\
  \ thousands of pages, scribbled in Flossie's mad demented scrawl\u2014so unlike\
  \ her sister's elegant copperplate!\u2014and kept in an airtight and lead-lined\
  \ storage facility in a subterranean cavern somewhere below the Swiss Alps. Who\
  \ knows what secrets it contains? Marvellous secrets!\n\nBlossom, or Flossie, or\
  \ someone else entirely, as a child.\n[2012-09-07]"
