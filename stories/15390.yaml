text: "Crikey! I think that must be the longest period of eerie silence at Hooting\
  \ Yard since records began fourteen years ago. Much has happened in the interim.\
  \ Well \u2026 not that much. There has been ongoing eye trouble (not yet resolved),\
  \ regular shows on Resonance\u2014available on Mixcloud\u2014where I have been looking\
  \ at past investigations of plums and swans and Captain Nitty, and a brief trip\
  \ to Scotland. Oh, and I was asked to name a trawler.\nTo ease you back in to what\
  \ they call the Hooting Yard Experience, I bring you the work of Charles Anthony.\
  \ I have no idea who Mr Anthony is, but he is clearly a very sensible man. Please\
  \ take a minute to marvel at this and this.\n[2017-06-02]"
