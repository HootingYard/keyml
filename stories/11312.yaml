text: "There is a fictional character named, somewhat foolishly, \u201CZiggy Stardust\u201D\
  , the creation of a one-time student of mime named David Bowie. Among the attributes\
  \ of Mr Stardust, we are told that he is \u201Clike a leper messiah\u201D. I wondered\
  \ if there was a real, non-fictional leper messiah Mr Bowie had in mind, or, given\
  \ that he uses the indefinite rather than the definite article, whether there might\
  \ actually be several such messiahs, languishing in leper colonies across the globe.\
  \ One way to find out would be to make a tour of leper colonies, where they still\
  \ exist, in countries including India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia,\
  \ Vietnam, and Japan.\nBefore planning such an arduous itinerary, I did some background\
  \ reading on Mr Bowie, and I discovered that he had often expressed an interest\
  \ in the last-named of those nations, Japan. Somewhere he spoke of being \u201C\
  under Japanese influence\u201D and elsewhere of \u201Cpictures of Jap girls in synthesis\u201D\
  . I also learned that he had once been buried up to his neck when pretending to\
  \ be an inmate of a Second World War Japanese prisoner of war camp. These clues\
  \ were enough for me to dismiss any thought of travelling to India, China, Romania,\
  \ Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, or Vietnam, and to focus all my attention on the\
  \ land of the rising sun. It seemed fairly clear that, if there were indeed one\
  \ or more leper messiahs, they were almost certainly to be found in a Japanese leper\
  \ colony.\n\nImpatient to proceed with my quest, I jumped into a Japanese car and\
  \ told the driver to take me to the airport. Instead, he drove me to a forest in\
  \ the Japanese car, and left a hole in the back of my head, hiding in the foliage\
  \ and peat. It was wet and I was losing my body heat. Mr Bowie spoke of his honour\
  \ being at stake when he was under Japanese influence, but for me it was more a\
  \ case of injured pride, or nearly. And to make matters worse, I was nowhere near\
  \ Japan, nowhere near even the airport. What price now my important research into\
  \ Japanese leper messiahs?\nAnyway, stumbling through the foliage, I came upon some\
  \ picnickers. Along with their hamper and rug and folding chairs and cans of wasp\
  \ repellant, they had a cassette deck. It was playing poptones. I cocked an ear\
  \ and listened carefully, hoping it might be one of Mr Bowie's songs about Mr Stardust,\
  \ but alas it was not.\n\u201CGood afternoon,\u201D I said to the picnickers, or\
  \ rather shouted, to make myself heard above the din of poptones, \u201CThis is\
  \ something of a long shot, but I don't suppose you all hail from a nearby leper\
  \ colony?\u201D\n\u201CActually, we do,\u201D said one, munching on a sausage. I\
  \ was both pleased and surprised to note that he was of decidedly oriental appearance.\
  \ Indeed, in spite of the rain, he was wearing a kimono.\n\u201CMay I join your\
  \ picnic?\u201D I asked, \u201CI am famished.\u201D\n\u201CWait a moment,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CWe shall have to ask permission.\u201D\n\u201CFrom whom?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nHe pointed towards a tent which had been erected some yards away to\
  \ the east.\n\u201COur Almighty Lord and Master dwells within that tent,\u201D he\
  \ said, \u201CWe must seek his guidance in all things, including whether you may\
  \ join us in our picnicking.\u201D He swallowed another chunk of sausage.\nOh still\
  \ my beating heart! Could it be that I had somehow located the leper messiah, picnicking\
  \ in the British countryside?\n\u201CMay I come into the tent with you?\u201D I\
  \ asked.\n\u201CI am afraid not,\u201D said the Japanese picnic leper, \u201CBut\
  \ you may wait at the tent flap.\u201D\nSo I did, and quite against protocol I took\
  \ the opportunity to peek inside. And I was astounded by what I saw. The leper messiah\
  \ was not Japanese after all! There, in the gloom of the tent, I saw, dressed in\
  \ scarlet and grey, sitting beside a telly, with his tiny hands on his tummy, chuckling\
  \ away, a leprous, laughing gnome!\n[2013-04-24]"
