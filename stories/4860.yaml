  \ his contributions to learned journals were papers on meteorology, navigation,\
  \ surveying, anthropology, archaeology, painting, photography, the use of spectacles\
  \ by divers, ultrasonic whistles, diet fads, currency reform, visions, corporal\
  \ punishment, the ideal length of rope for hanging people, the flashing of signals\
  \ to Mars, and dozens of other topics. Almost as numerous were his inventions, ranging\
  \ from advanced scientific instruments to gadgets for personal convenience. At the\
  \ age of thirteen he designed a steam flying machine, followed by an hour-glass\
  \ speedometer for bicycles, and, in later life, a periscope for seeing over the\
  \ heads of crowds. It was used for viewing processions, of which he was particularly\
  \ fond, in conjunction with a wooden brick, wrapped in cloth and tied to a string\
  \ so that it could be lowered to the ground for standing on.\u201D\nI know what\
  \ you're thinking. Did Dobson and Bl\xF6tzmann spawn some kind of love-child (perhaps\
  \ using a technique concocted by the latter)? But no. Apart from anything else,\
  \ that would be chronologically incoherent, like a leech doctor with a brain scanner.\
  \ It is in fact Francis Galton, as described in Eccentric Lives And Peculiar Notions\
  \ by John Michell (1984). There is a touch, too, of Joost Van Dongelbraacke, the\
  \ suburban shaman. Michell notes that Galton\n\u201Cwas strongly religious, but\
  \ the only type of worship that appealed to him was the spontaneous variety he had\
  \ seen among the Africans. He considered that their chants, dances and fetish worship\
  \ expressed the genuine religious spirit of the natural man. As usual, he put that\
  \ belief to practical test. Looking round for the least worshipful object he could\
  \ find, he hit upon the comic figure of Mr Punch, and forced his mind into believing\
  \ that it possessed divine powers. The experiment succeeded. He came to experience\
  \ \u2018a large share of the feelings a barbarian entertains towards his idol\u2019\
  , and for a long time he was unable to look at Mr Punch's grotesque features without\
  \ a feeling of reverence.\u201D\n\nPhotograph and Bertillon record of Francis Galton\
