text: 'Remarkably, it is seven years ago today that Hooting Yard readers learned of
  the exciting radio serial Pie Shop Deep Space Six. My informants tell me that it
  is still at the development stage, beset by teething problems. Here is that original
  announcement:

  Hurtling at inhuman speed through the universe, the thoroughly exciting spaceship
  Double Pneumonia was headed for a galaxy so distant that it would take billions
  upon billions of generations of leafcutter ants to reach it. In command on the bridge
  was Star Captain Barbara Bel Geddes, accompanied by First Officer Mister Unstrebnodtalb,
  who was only half human. No one had ever worked out what weird extraterrestrial
  life-form had spawned his other half, and it was best not to ask, for therein lay
  madness.

  And a certain madcap frenzy is what you can expect in the new science fiction drama
  Pie Shop Deep Space Six, currently being developed by a crack team headed by Mrs
  Gubbins, who has returned to Haemoglobin Towers. The elderly crone has put down
  her knitting and, fuelled by lots of piping hot cups of tea, is conjuring up some
  thrilling ideas for this new radio serial.

  In episode one, for example, hostile plasmatronic aliens launch an attack on space
  station Epsilon Nova X-977, cutting off pastry supplies to the pie shop. Mister
  Unstrebnodtalb outwits them using a supersonic brain-zapping process involving lots
  of sparks and whooshing noises.

  Mrs Gubbins has asked Sir Harrison Birtwistle to compose the theme music.
