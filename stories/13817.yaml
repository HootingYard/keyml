  \ \u201CI'd like to hear that set to music by Outa_Spaceman\u201D. And lo! it has\
  \ now been set to music and performed by Mr Spaceman. You can listen to his fine\
  \ rendition here.\nNext up, I would like to hear a large-scale Orchestral Variations\
  \ On A Theme Of Bonkers Maisie By Outa_Spaceman, and perhaps an ear-splitting choral\
  \ version, but I suppose that is too much to ask.\n[2015-02-15]"
