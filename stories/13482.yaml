  \ three hours per day listening to Jubilate Agno, Christopher Smart's lengthy and\
  \ demented poem, recited in full by Mr Key and Germander Speedwell. Happily, there\
  \ is a link to the recording at the Public Domain Review. Backsliders take note!\n\
  Which prompts me to bring to your attention the newly-published Public Domain Review\_\
  : Selected Essays 2011\u20132013, a book which you ought to buy immediately. Go\
  \ here for further details and ordering information. Mr Key's piece on Kit Smart\
  \ is included in the book, so it is a necessary purchase (along with Kew. Rhone.)\
  \ for all fanatically devoted Hooting Yard completists, which of course is every\
  \ last one of you.\n\n[2014-11-18]"
