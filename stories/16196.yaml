text: "Blimey! That was a bloody awful start to the year. On New Year's Eve I began\
  \ to feel as sick as a particularly sick dog, and I then spent most of January sprawled\
  \ in bed, moaning weakly. Only in the past few days do I at last seem to be recovering\
  \ my pep, or what passes for pep in these parts.\nIt now behooves me to set Hooting\
  \ Yard back on course after a whole month of silence. To this end, I have devised\
  \ a foolhardy scheme, a planned series of interconnected pieces o\u2019 prose, none\
  \ of which I have yet written. We shall see how that pans out in the coming weeks.\n\
  Meanwhile, I ought to draw to your attention the annual fundraiser at ResonanceFM,\
  \ in the hope that you will give generously. You lot may be particularly interested\
  \ in bidding for this year's Hooting Yard auction item, a unique bespoke paperback\
  \ to be issued in an edition of one.\nI shall try to be back tomorrow, with some\
  \ new prose \u2026\n[2018-02-02]"
