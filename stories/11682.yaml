text: "So hushed was the consulting room of Dr Pindrop that you could hear a pin drop.\
  \ Thus, at the moment I dropped a pin, I coughed loudly, to camouflage the ping!\
  \ of its landing on the linoleum. Now all I had to do was to wait for Dr Pindrop\
  \ to come in. I whistled an approximation of the song of the masked shrike, Lanius\
  \ nubicus, getting into character as Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe RAF, portrayed\
  \ by Donald Pleasence in The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963). When Dr Pindrop\
  \ entered, he would be in the role of Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley DFC RAF,\
  \ played in the film by James Garner. We would enact, albeit imperfectly, the poignant\
  \ scene where it becomes apparent that Blythe is virtually blind, what with the\
  \ eye-strain brought on by all that diligent counterfeiting of papers and passports\
  \ and what have you.\nBut when Dr Pindrop pushed open the door and entered his consulting\
  \ room, I saw something was up. Unlike Blythe, my vision was not occluded. Indeed,\
  \ it was so piercing that I could count each individual furrow on the troubled brow\
  \ of Dr Pindrop, though I was waiting at the far end of the room.\n\u201CI am so\
  \ sorry, Blodweg,\u201D said Dr Pindrop, \u201CSomething has come up and I have\
  \ no time to take part in our reenactment of a classic film scene.\u201D\n\u201C\
  What is the matter?\u201D I asked.\n\u201COh, you need not worry your odd-shaped\
  \ little head about the titanic responsibilities of an important physician,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CSuffice to say I shall be spending the rest of the day applying\
  \ probes to the brains of guinea pigs.\u201D\nI complained that this left me at\
  \ something of a loose end, just when I had entered what I think of as \u201Cthe\
  \ zone\u201D. In that zone, I was Donald Pleasence, or Colin Blythe, or some exquisite\
  \ amalgam of the two.\n\u201CI understand your concern,\u201D said Dr Pindrop, in\
  \ that mollifying tone he usually employs at the bedsides of the stricken, \u201C\
  But listen, out there in the waiting room are all my guinea pigs, sitting quietly.\
  \ You could deliver Blythe's ornithology lecture, from earlier in the film, and\
  \ whistle the song of the masked shrike, Lanius nubicus.\u201D\n\u201CTo guinea\
  \ pigs?\u201D I asked, aghast.\n\u201CThey are human guinea pigs,\u201D said Dr\
  \ Pindrop.\nI had to admit that this was a splendid idea, and meant that my intellectual\
  \ and emotional straining to become Donald Pleasence / Colin Blythe would not go\
  \ to waste.\n\n\u201CBefore you go,\u201D said Dr Pindrop, \u201CPick up that pin\
  \ you dropped earlier, would you?\u201D\nAs I went to retrieve it, he stuck out\
  \ his leg and tripped me over. We had enacted the classic film scene, albeit imperfectly,\
  \ after all!\nThrilled with my performance, and still in character, I went out into\
  \ the waiting room to tell the human guinea pigs about birds. But they were no longer\
  \ sitting quietly. They had been corralled into a corner of the waiting room by\
  \ Dr Pindrop's receptionist, Mrs Creasefrock, who was toting a submachine gun. It\
  \ took me a matter of moments to realise that she was in \u201Cthe zone\u201D as\
  \ Hans Gruber, the criminal mastermind from Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988) played\
  \ by Alan Rickman.\n\u201CMrs Creasefrock!\u201D I cried, \u201CI had no idea you\
  \ too were a member of the Classic Action Film Scene Reenactment Society!\u201D\n\
  She fired a burst of ammo into the ceiling and looked me over.\n\u201CNice suit,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201CJohn Phillips, London. I have two myself. Rumour has it Arafat\
  \ buys his there.\u201D\nGosh, she really was in the zone! I had to think fast.\
  \ This was no scene for Donald Pleasence. On the spur of the moment, I decided to\
  \ shift character to one of Hans Gruber's team of ruthless criminals, and I ran\
  \ and crashed through the plate-glass window of Dr Pindrop's waiting room, plummeting\
  \ several storeys before landing with a terrific thump on a police car parked below,\
  \ shattering the windscreen\n\u201CHello!\u201D, I said to the startled driver,\
  \ \u201CYou must be Sergeant Al Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson.\u201D\nI\
  \ rubbed at my eyes to dislodge a fragment of the shattered windscreen.\n\u201C\
  Can I help you?\u201D said the driver.\n\u201COh no, please, it's only something\
  \ in my eye,\u201D I said.\n\u201CPlease let me look. I happen to be a doctor,\u201D\
  \ he said, and I realised he was the general secretary of the Classic Romantic Film\
  \ Scene Reenactment Society. He was not Sergeant Al Powell. He was in the zone as\
  \ Dr Alec Harvey, played by Trevor Howard in Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945)!\n\
  It took all my thespian skills to slough off, in an instant, both Colin Blythe and\
  \ a member of a German criminal gang.\n\u201COh, why must we be so withdrawn and\
  \ shy and . . . difficult?\u201D I said. The sun was shining on the nothing new.\n\
