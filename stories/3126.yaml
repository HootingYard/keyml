text: "Who but an Englishman, the legendary Sir John Franklin, could have managed\
  \ to die of starvation and scurvy along with all 129 of his men in a region of the\
  \ Canadian Arctic whose game had supported an Eskimo colony for centuries? When\
  \ the corpses of some of Franklin's officers and crew were later discovered, miles\
  \ from their ships, the men were found to have left behind their guns but to have\
  \ lugged such essentials as monogrammed silver cutlery, a backgammon board, a cigar\
  \ case, a clothes brush, a tin of button polish, and a copy of The Vicar Of Wakefield.\
  \ These men may have been incompetent bunglers, but, by God, they were gentlemen.\n\
