text: "It is exactly sixty years ago today that the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopathic\
  \ serial killer Babinsky made his appearance on the radio programme Squalid Criminal\
  \ Lair Discs. This was a short-lived offshoot of Desert Island Discs, the difference\
  \ being that the guest was invited to choose what music he would take to a squalid\
  \ criminal lair rather than to a desert island. The programme proved controversial,\
  \ not least because Babinsky took the opportunity to hack to pieces with his axe\
  \ and slicer the presenter, one Roy Plum. That is why it was a short-lived show.\
  \ In fact, the Babinsky episode was the only one ever recorded.\nBut the on-air\
  \ slaughter of the presenter, and Babinsky's daring escape from the studio pursued\
  \ by Detective Captain Cargpan and his coppers, were not the only sources of controversy.\
  \ There was much comment, in The Listener and the Radio Times and elsewhere, regarding\
  \ the fact that Babinsky's choices were all self-penned songs, including titles\
  \ such as \u201CHomburg\u201D, \u201CConquistador\u201D, \u201CMabel\u201D, and\
  \ \u201CRepent Walpurgis\u201D. (Many years later, much reworked and faffed with,\
  \ and with the more terrifying passages excised, the songs were rerecorded, and\
  \ claimed as their own, by a popular beat combo.) For Squalid Criminal Lair Discs,\
  \ however, Babinsky engaged his own band to perform the songs, a one-off grouping\
  \ including the jazz maestro Dollar Crane, the mysterious science fiction writer\u2014\
  yachtsman\u2014cult leader L. Ron De La Car, the Dancer Lola R., and Errol D. Canal,\
  \ alter ego of Dr. Leon Clara, the so-called \u201CLala Crone Dr.\u201D whose work\
  \ with various lala crones predated Dr. Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy. It\
  \ was the bloodcurdling screaming of the lala crones that made Babinsky's songs\
  \ so puissant.\nIn his flight from the studio, Babinsky stuffed into a sack not\
  \ only Roy Plum's head but the master tape of the programme, which he carried back\
  \ to his squalid criminal lair. Neither head nor tape has been seen since that day,\
  \ sixty years ago. Nor, for that matter, has anybody seen hide nor hair of the lala\
  \ crones, despite searching for them high and low in various Mercy Homes for the\
  \ Bewildered and the Fraught and the Baffled and the Lala.\n[2013-02-01]"
