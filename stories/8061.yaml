  Falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors\u201D. Dammit!, I exclaimed, aloud,\
  \ cursing that someone, somewhere, had preempted precisely the title of the PhD\
  \ thesis on which I have been working for years.\nIt was towards the end of the\
  \ last century, when I was mentally flailing around seeking a suitable topic for\
  \ my doctorate, that I happened one day to wander into a theatre, or rather, a \u201C\
  theatre space\u201D. There was no stage as such, but rather a \u201Cperformative\
  \ zone\u201D, almost but not quite identical to a dentist's waiting room, which\
  \ is where I thought I was going. In this \u201Czone\u201D, several persons were\
  \ disporting themselves in mysterious ways, some of them physically flailing around\
  \ much as I was flailing mentally. Perhaps it was that sense of connection which\
  \ made me pause, and sit, and watch, intently, a performance I might otherwise have\
  \ dismissed as tomfoolery. The participants cut capers and jumped about and shimmied\
  \ and threw somersaults and adopted ridiculous postures, and I had absolutely no\
  \ idea what was going on, but I was sufficiently intrigued that, when it was all\
  \ over, some hours later, I approached one of the cavorting persons and asked him\
  \ what it was I had been watching.\n\u201CPant pant pant,\u201D he panted, then\
  \ added \u201CWe are in rehearsals for our adaptation of Wolfgang Peterson's 1981\
  \ epic war film Das Boot, interpreted through the medium of dance.\u201D\nI had\
  \ not seen this film, so I cannot comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation,\
  \ but I had been struck by the fact that, at certain points, some of the dancers\
  \ had portrayed their characters quite negatively. One of them scowled a lot. Another\
  \ seemed a bit weedy. A third had contrived to move his body in the manner of a\
  \ malevolent beetle. I was sure such behaviour had not been at all common on World\
  \ War Two submarines. There and then I had an epiphany, and I realised that the\
  \ falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors would be the perfect subject for\
  \ my doctoral thesis.\nI hurried home and set to work. Over the following decade,\
  \ I put under intense scrutiny each and every portrayal of U-boat sailors I could\
  \ track down, in films, plays, novels, poems, pop songs, television programmes,\
  \ operas, operettas, opera bouffes, ballets, even in World War Two Battle Re-enactment\
  \ Society weekend workshops.\nItem\_: Submariner Second Class Horst Krumbein in\
  \ The Loathsome U-Boat Sailor, a \u201Cmonologue for voice and improv jazz ensemble\u201D\
  \ by Tadaaki Sirinuntananon (1968). Krumbein is depicted as sweaty, myopic, plagued\
  \ by boils and utterly lacking in social skills.\nItem\_: Submariner First Class\
  \ Viggo Beckenbauer in The U-Boat Sailor With The Shameful Past, an award-winning\
  \ drama by radical playwright Geoff Beard (1973). In the opening minutes of the\
  \ play, we are led to believe that Beckenbauer is a heroic figure. Tall, blond,\
  \ and impossibly handsome, he strides about the stage while his crewmates gasp and\
  \ swoon at just how fantastic he is. But then comes the thunderclap, when it is\
  \ revealed that, back in D\xFCsseldorf before becoming a submariner, he had been\
  \ convicted of bus fare evasion, forging a dog licence, and half a dozen axe murders.\
  \ \u201CI joined the navy to forget\u2026 to forget,\u201D he pleads in an emotionally\
  \ wrenching speech, but his crewmates, who it must be said are not subject to falsely\
  \ negative portrayal by Beard, will have none of it, and they await calm seas and\
  \ the absence of enemy submarines to surface, and build a pyre on top of the hull,\
  \ and bind Beckenbauer to a post atop the pyre, and they burn him while dancing\
  \ in circles, brandishing flaming torches, and chanting.\nItem\_: Captain Hans Gruber\
  \ in the film Die Hard In A Submarine (2004). To be honest, I ought not pick out\
  \ the captain as the only negatively portrayed U-boat sailor in this blockbuster,\
  \ for the entire crew is made up of black-hearted scalliwags and ruffians who take\
  \ pleasure in stamping their big hefty boots on small scurrying mammals, and similar\
  \ enormities.\nI think that is enough items to be going on with. The point is to\
  \ demonstrate just how thorough my research had been, the better so you can grasp\
  \ the degree of dismay I suffered when I thought someone else had not only been\
  \ ploughing the same academic furrow as I was, but had gone ahead and posted their\
  \ findings on what our Belgian pals call Het Internet.\nImagine my relief, then,\
  \ when I actually looked up the Wikipedia entry headed Falsely negative portrayal\
  \ of U-boat sailors and found that it was merely a 77-word paragraph within the\
  \ piece about the film U-571 (Jonathan Mostow, 2000). As with Das Boot, I have not\
  \ seen this film either, in spite of my indefatigable research. Clearly my work\
  \ is not yet done.\n[2012-01-07]"
