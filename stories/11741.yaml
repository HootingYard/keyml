text: "See, see, if you will, the king's custard-crown, burnished and gleaming, made\
  \ from metal so soft you could mould it like marzipan, though woe betide you if\
  \ you put your hand anywhere near it when it's atop the kingly head\u2014he'll hack\
  \ two fingers off and shove them one each into your ears, muffling all sound, as\
  \ happened alas to my spry confr\xE8re Nitty, poor Nitty, languishing deaf now in\
  \ the king's donjon, and all for his thoughtless prodding, from mere curiosity,\
  \ that custard-crown.\nThere's a sprig of larkspur on the donjon's outer wall and\
  \ on All Souls I'll pluck a bud and wave it as a nosegay for all the good that will\
  \ do poor Nitty. I plead his case with the hoity toity chamberlains and their scrivening\
  \ beadles, booted callow murgatroyds with pig eyes not one of them a true prince,\
  \ cushioned against fate, smacking their lips, oh all at sixes and sevens aboard\
  \ the boat of state. I tried my own clambering aboard it, once, in spring, jaunty,\
  \ feather-capp'd, in gorgeous hues, but was repelled with sticks and fists and cudgelry,\
  \ bloodied and battered and half-drowned I was, afterward sprawled ashore in my\
  \ pumps like a water-devil. Snip, snip, the ties loosed and away it went, billowing\
  \ on green, out of my sight, me sloshed in bilge, and all for Nitty.\nNow step one,\
  \ two and cut brisk capers and you will see the custard-crown oh bright gleaming\
  \ but now no longer embonced upon the kingly head, no, whippoorwills and shelmerdines\
  \ came sweeping in and snatched it away and carried it to a darkling cave anent\
  \ the lumpy bumpy banksome landing of the lake. Nitty has his army-in-exile here,\
  \ custard-coloured like the crown, prinked, swift, but so disputatious they jabber\
  \ phrenzies all the livelong day and terrible night and scarce can boil an egg for\
  \ their supper so caught up are they in their rebarbative hoodoo. They might be\
  \ ants.\nThe king, though, like a felled ox, still in his palace keep, dabbed at\
  \ with ointments by his chatelaine, has Russian plimsolls hardily shod on his great\
  \ titanic enormous feet, dangling over the end of the pallet. Up! Up! King! Birds\
  \ chatter on the windowsill. There is lively sparring yet, in this kingdom. Jack\
  \ Maglew and all his train cannot lift the king, hoist though they try with pulleys\
  \ and contraptions of fabled strength. Custard-crownless, his life ebbs, while below\
  \ in the donjon Nitty waggles the severed fingers plugging his ears and jumps through\
  \ spirit hoops in dank darkness.\nAnd now his army is on the march, beside the railings,\
  \ with their banners, and their pipes tooting cacophonous, and swallows in formation\
  \ flying o'er their horrible shrunken withered heads, that zombie army of Nitty's\
  \ conjuration, in rags and tatters, foul with sweat, swords rusted, as implacable\
  \ in their progress as a swordfish spearing through the deep, marching clank and\
  \ jangle on the palace, the collapsing palace, perched on its promontory and crumbling\
  \ bit by bit into the sea.\nI plucked another bud of larkspur and waved it as a\
  \ nosegay and tested the wind. The wind is coming in. There is yet an empire to\
  \ be flattened.\n\nI noted on David Thompson's blog that he will often append to\
  \ a postage a request for donations. I think I will follow suit. If you enjoy reading\
  \ Hooting Yard, and particularly if you have not previously felt impelled to donate,\
  \ please consider bashing that button over to the right, and warming your cockles\
  \ in the knowledge that you have done a generous deed.\n[2013-07-18]"
