text: "Along with the Undimmed by Death postcard, I unearthed another set of six cards\
  \ from the same era. These are hand-drawn and hand-written, and collectively titled\
  \ Sulky Bulgarian Poets. Unfortunately, the drawings are cack-handed and the \u201C\
  poems\u201D are atrocious\u2014with one exception. Number 5, \u201CIn Fish And Shipping\u201D\
  , is attributed to sulky Bulgarian poet Elvis Targnegescubit, and, though it pre-dates\
  \ Hooting Yard, I think it is a worthy addition to the canon.\nIn despicable visions\
  \ of\n  An unholy refrigerator,\n  Another refrigerator,\n  In implacable discussions\
  \ of\n  A swordfish,\n  A carp,\n  An enormous schooner,\n  A small schooner,\n\
  \  A tiny ship, ship-ette,\n  In all these I have said,\n  Irrefutably, not once,\n\
  \  But with venom,\n  I am a very fat man.\n[2016-12-29]"
