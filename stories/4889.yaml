  \ experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured up by the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman in\
  \ the deep dense weird woods, without actually having to enter the deep dense weird\
  \ woods for a moonlit encounter with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself. In part,\
  \ your surprise would be that anybody could manage to articulate that question on\
  \ an empty stomach. Until now, my standard answer has been \u201CNo, it is not possible\
  \ to somehow experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured up by the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman in the deep dense weird woods, without actually having to enter the deep\
  \ dense weird woods for a moonlit encounter with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself,\u201D\
  \ although depending on how much time is at my disposal I might just say \u201C\
  No\u201D or even slap the importuning reader about the head with the outer packaging\
  \ from a carton of smokers\u2019 poptarts.\nI say \u201Cuntil now\u201D because,\
  \ thanks to David Thompson, I have learned of the activities of a certain Erial\
  \ Ali. Click on this link, scroll down, slowly, slowly, and be engulfed in mystic\
  \ woohoohoodiwoo!\n[2010-07-30]"
