text: "As the world collapses around our ears, there are a few glimmers of brightness\
  \ to keep us in good cheer. I, for one, have been heartened by the inexorable rise\
  \ of the sepia-tinged, snail's pace computer game, and am in a mildly non-comatose\
  \ state following the announcement that Collective Farm Administrator 2.0 is about\
  \ to hit the shelves in time for Christmas.\nAvailable for X-Crate, PlayBusStop,\
  \ and WeeWee, this mind-numbing game allows players to wallow in the sheer unadulterated\
  \ tedium of administrating a collective farm in some godforsaken rustic hellhole\
  \ fifty years ago. Sitting at your desk in a corner of a virtual barn, you have\
  \ to make bureaucratic decisions about cows, goats, tractors and similar farmyard\
  \ appurtenances, fill in lots of paperwork, and drink weak and watery pixellated\
  \ tea from a grubby pixellated samovar while you await the arrival of the regional\
  \ collective farm supervisor, who could appear on the screen at any moment, but\
  \ may just as likely never arrive at all.\nTo give a flavour of the game, here are\
  \ a couple of screenshots.\n\n\nFor added verisimilitude, scenes such as these remain\
  \ \u201Cstuck\u201D on screen for days on end. Sound effects include the mooing\
  \ of a tubercular cow and the puttering of a tractor about to run out of fuel.\n\
  While you await delivery of your pre-ordered copy of Collective Farm Administrator\
  \ 2.0, you may indulge in further rustic fun and frolic, this time in full colour,\
  \ by following this link. My thanks to Ed Baxter of Resonance FM for drawing it\
  \ to my attention.\n[2009-11-07]"
