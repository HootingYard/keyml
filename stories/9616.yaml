text: "It was a rainy morning in the late 1970s when I was called for an interview\
  \ with the school's careers adviser. He was an unkempt man and he smoked a pipe.\n\
  \u201CCome in and sit down, sonny,\u201D he said, \u201CI am the careers adviser.\
  \ I am here to help you decide what you want to do with the rest of your life. Generally\
  \ speaking, I find most boys fit snugly into one of two careers. Welding, for monoglots,\
  \ and the diplomatic service, for polyglots. How many languages do you speak?\u201D\
  \nI was a single-minded, even obsessive, teenperson, so I ignored his question and\
  \ jabbered back. \u201CEver since I was tiny, sir, it has been my dream to follow\
  \ in the footsteps of my hero, Johs. Schmidt, 1877 to 1933. Are you familiar with\
  \ his work?\u201D\nHe seemed taken aback by my pure ringing confident tone, and\
  \ choked on his pipe. \u201CI can't say I am, sonny. Now, about welding . . .\u201D\
  \nBut I interrupted him, and babbled on.\n\u201CJohs. Schmidt was the author of\
  \ a book I have treasured since first I discovered it tucked away in the aquatic\
  \ life forms section of my parents\u2019 bookshelves. I have read it, from cover\
  \ to cover, hundreds of times. It is entitled Danish Eel Investigations During 25\
  \ Years 1905\u20131930. Though both welding and the diplomatic service undoubtedly\
  \ have their attractions, I have already determined, young as I am, to spend the\
  \ next twenty-five years investigating Danish eels. After that, well, who knows\
  \ what I might turn my hand to?\u201D\nI had presented the careers adviser with\
  \ a fait accompli, so he tapped his pipe on the side of his desk and sent me on\
  \ my way.\nThe very next morning I set sail for Denmark, bent on eels . . . Dear\
  \ God in heaven! How I wish that were true! But life was not as simple as I assumed,\
  \ and things gang agley, as it were. Instead of spending the next quarter of a century\
  \ investigating Danish eels, I found myself welding. Weld, weld, weld, that was\
  \ me, for more than twenty-five years, day in day out. It was never clear to me\
  \ precisely how this came about, and it would be melodramatic to describe it as\
  \ a living death, but my eel dreams were shattered. It has to be said that there\
  \ were certain aspects of welding that I enjoyed, particularly arc welding and the\
  \ welding of rivets, but at the end of each welding day I would return home and\
  \ pore over Johs. Schmidt's book\u2014well, pamphlet\u2014and reread those stirring\
  \ words, and gaze for untold hours at his Danish eel map. I made a promise to myself\
  \ that one day, I would write my own pamphlet, with exactly the same title and with\
  \ only the dates changed, that one day, I would write \u201CI set sail for Denmark,\
  \ bent on eels . . .\u201D And do you know what? A week ago, I kept that promise.\n\
  With no more welding to be done in my town, I was freed from my duty to the regime.\
  \ They gave me a medal, and I had my photograph taken for the Worker's Sop (Welding\
  \ Edition), but these honours meant nothing to me. For years I had been secretly\
  \ in contact with a Dane called Lars. Lars knew little or nothing about eels, but\
  \ he had a tiptop grasp of Danish geography, particularly its watery places, and\
  \ I had long been convinced he would be an ideal companion for my investigations.\
  \ I sent him a message arranging to meet on the harbourside of an important Danish\
  \ seaport, packed a bag, locked up my cabin, and went straight to the tram stop.\
  \ I did not have the necessary papers, but after waiting for over a quarter of a\
  \ century, I was determined that nothing would stop me. On my way to the tram stop,\
  \ I popped in to the cemetery, and found the grave of my careers adviser from long\
  \ ago, and I thumbed my nose at him, or at his headstone. An act of childish petulance,\
  \ perhaps, but boy oh boy did it feel good. Then I caught the tram to the canal,\
  \ and went down the canal by barge to the railway station, where I boarded a train\
  \ to the coast. All the while I had to keep my eye out for Lavender Cadets. At the\
  \ docks, I bribed a sailor with my welding medal, and he helped me to stow away\
  \ on the SS The Joy Of Bumper Harvest Overflows Amidst The Song Of Mechanisation.\
  \ If I was not mistaken, I had welded many of the rivets on this very ship! And\
  \ so, at long last, I was heading for Denmark. Hiding away among huge bales of fusewire\
  \ in the cargo hold, I reread Danish Eel Investigations During 25 Years 1905\u2013\
  1930 yet again. In my excitement, I was struck anew by Johs. Schmidt's marvellous\
  \ prose, which now seemed even more magical. I could barely wait to begin writing\
  \ my own version. Would my eel-prose come up to snuff?\nAt the important Danish\
  \ seaport, Lars was there to meet me, bearing gifts. He gave me a cap and a Thermos\
  \ flask and a lemon meringue pie. I had nothing to give him in exchange except my\
  \ unbridled gratitude.\n\u201CSo, tomorrow we shall begin investigating Danish eels,\
  \ yes?\u201D he said.\n\u201CI have been waiting over a quarter of a century for\
  \ this moment!\u201D I shouted, \u201CLet us begin our investigations right now!\u201D\
  \nLars gave me a funny look, but acquiesced. It will of course be twenty-five years\
  \ before I am able to publish my pamphlet, but I see no harm in allowing you a glimpse\
  \ of the first entry.\nDanish Eel Investigations During 25 Years, Day One. I arrived\
  \ in Denmark. At the important Danish seaport, Lars was there to meet me, bearing\
  \ gifts. He gave me a cap and a Thermos flask and a lemon meringue pie. I had nothing\
  \ to give him in exchange except my unbridled gratitude. We immediately set to work\
  \ investigating Danish eels. I managed to spot one there at the harbourside! To\
  \ my consternation, it looked exactly\u2014and I mean exactly\u2014like an eel from\
  \ my homeland. This cannot be right. Luckily I have plenty of time to investigate\
  \ other Danish eels. Sausages for supper, and so to bed.\n[2012-07-10]"
