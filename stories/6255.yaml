  \ so much better!\u201D\nSuch were the cries of lamentation heard across the ancient\
  \ world as papyrus scrolls were replaced by that new-fangled Roman invention the\
  \ codex, or book.\n\u201CWhy do I have to flip these\u2014what are they called?\
  \ pages? The scrolls ran so smoothly under my hand, they signified a seamless flow\
  \ of knowledge, a noble tradition, now it's all chopped up into scraps signifying\
  \ nothing \u2026\u201D\nThe Luddites\u2019 fretful complaints drone on down the\
  \ centuries, ever eloquent in bemoaning the end of civilization as we know it, while\
  \ civilization as we aren't quite used to it yet is busy being born. The invention\
  \ of the printing press was the work of the devil according to these doomsayers,\
  \ and maybe they were right because it did spread those dangerous things called\
  \ ideas to the previously unlettered masses. They began thinking for themselves,\
  \ founding new churches, having revolutions, writing novels that sent Victorian\
  \ ladies into a swoon, and reading everything from the Bible and Shakespeare to\
  \ tabloid gossip and vampire boyfriend sagas. Where will it all end? Not with a\
  \ bang or a whimper apparently, but with a tweet.\n[2011-03-24]"
