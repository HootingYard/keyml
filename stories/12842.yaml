text: "Word of the day\_: Glue.\nToday I want to look at the word glue. I also want\
  \ to take the opportunity to mop up the two earlier words of the day I have not\
  \ yet had a chance to examine, boggle and clunk. Mop, incidentally, is a fine word\
  \ in itself, so let us pencil that in for tomorrow. And while we are about it, let\
  \ us pencil in pencil for the day after tomorrow.\nIn the meantime, I have received\
  \ yet another letter from Wlad Onanugu. I presume it is another bit of wittering\
  \ about parp. I cannot say for sure, because\u2014with iron in my soul\u2014I have\
  \ thus far made a titanic effort not to open it, and thus have not yet read it.\
  \ Perhaps I never will. I might shove it, unopened, into my wastepaper basket, from\
  \ whence it will be tipped along with all sorts of other papery detritus, into a\
  \ great roaring furnace, when I have located such a furnace.\nI ought to make it\
  \ clear that it is not my habit to treat all correspondence from readers so shamefully.\
  \ Usually, I pore over your letters, rereading them a couple of times, until I have\
  \ winkled from them every last drop of whatever it is they contain\u2014wisdom,\
  \ wit, top tips, a scattering of breadcrumbs\u2014and then I chew the end of my\
  \ pencil before scribbling a response. If you take the trouble to write, I ought\
  \ to take the trouble to reply. So I have terrible misgivings about Mr Onanugu's\
  \ latest missive. But quite honestly, if I have to bang on about parp yet again,\
  \ this series is never going to get anywhere.\nAfter I wrote that paragraph, my\
  \ terrible misgivings got the better of me, and I decided after all to open, and\
  \ read, Mr Onanugu's letter. If it turned out to be all about parp again\u2014and\
  \ toot and hooter and tots\u2014then so be it. I would frame a response which, I\
  \ hoped, would dissuade my pesky correspondent from ever putting pencil to paper\
  \ again for so long as he lived.\nAs I reached across my desk for the letter, however,\
  \ I knocked over an opened can of Squelcho!, from which I had taken only a single\
  \ dainty glug, with the result that I ended up with a puddle of fizzy luminous highly-coloured\
  \ chemically-enhanced liquid on the floor. I was not entirely sure how high its\
  \ acidic content was, but I feared it might start eating through the floorboards,\
  \ like the blood of the alien in Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979). So at once I fetched\
  \ a mop to mop it up. See what a great word mop is? It is both a noun and a verb.\
  \ One mops with a mop. And I won't even begin to talk about Beatle-hair!\nAnyway,\
  \ I was so exhausted after my mopping (with a mop!) that I had to go and take a\
  \ nap. Which means that I will have to set aside boggle and clunk and glue for another\
  \ day. On a more positive note, it could be argued that I have already composed\
  \ an illustrative sentence for tomorrow's word of the day, mop. Perhaps I can substitute\
  \ nap for mop, tomorrow. Wait and see.\n[2014-07-26]"
