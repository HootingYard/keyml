text: "Further to the critical responses to Ulysses and Infelicia, here are extracts\
  \ from four contemporary reviews of Oscar Wilde's The Picture Of Dorian Gray:\n\u201C\
  If Mr Wilde can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,\
  \ the sooner he takes to tailoring (or some other decent trade) the better for his\
  \ own reputation and the public's morals.\u201D\u2014The Scots Observer\n\u201C\
  This is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French decadents\u2014\
  a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with mephitic odours of moral\
  \ and spiritual putrefaction.\u201D\u2014The Daily Chronicle\n\u201CThe book is\
  \ unmanly, sickening, vicious and tedious.\u201D\u2014The Athenaeum\n\u201CI would\
  \ rather give my daughter a dose of prussic acid than allow her to read this book.\u201D\
  \u2014\u2018Paterfamilias\u2019 in Uplift\nADDENDUM\_: Apropos Oscar Wilde, here\
  \ is Gertrude Atherton explaining why, having seen his photograph, she declined\
  \ an invitation to meet him\_: \u201CHis mouth covered half his face, the most lascivious,\
  \ coarse, repulsive mouth I had ever seen. I might stand it in a large crowded drawing-room,\
  \ but not in a parlour, eight by eight, lit by three tallow candles. I should feel\
  \ as if I were under the sea, pursued by some bloated monster of the deep.\u201D\
