text: "The other day I popped in to the Town Hall to find out a bit about bins, park\
  \ benches, signage, flowerbeds and civic statuary. I think it is time to engage\
  \ more fully with the maintenance of my bailiwick and the municipal doings therein.\
  \ This impulse was prompted when, sitting on a park bench next to a civic statue\
  \ of the much-missed Alderman Spandau, alongside which was a bin in which weeds\
  \ hoed from a flowerbed had been chucked, I read a sign, placed there by the council,\
  \ which implored me, and, I suppose, anybody else who read it, to refrain from smoking\
  \ within the precincts of the park, to tidy up after my dog, though I did not have\
  \ a dog as such, to ensure I paid my council tax promptly, and to place any litter\
  \ I wished to discard in the bin provided. Each of these instructions, or pieces\
  \ of advice, or commands, or whatever we might call them, was translated into several\
  \ languages. It was a bloody big piece of signage. Incidentally, for those of you\
  \ attuned to the resonances of the colour spectrum, the bench was brown, the statue\
  \ was grey with patches of green, the bin was black, and the weeds were, weirdly,\
  \ gash gold-vermilion. I wouldn't have put them in the bin, I'd have taken them\
  \ home and arranged them in a vase and placed it on my mantelpiece, if I had a mantelpiece.\
  \ The sign itself was beige, with the writing in red. If I had to be more precise,\
  \ I would say it was blood red. I did not at the time understand why this might\
  \ be significant.\nIf I had either a dog or a mantelpiece, I might not have been\
  \ so quick to visit the Town Hall. Both would have claims on my attention. I would\
  \ have to take the dog for walkies, and shop for biscuits, and give it baths, and\
  \ possibly take it to the vet for injections from time to time. As for a mantelpiece,\
  \ that would need dusting, I suppose, and minor upkeep, such as the patching up\
  \ of crumbly bits, if it was rotting, and also much time spent in judicious contemplation\
  \ of items to display upon it, and the arrangement thereof. Those too would have\
  \ to be dusted, in addition to the mantelpiece itself, if I were to avoid becoming\
  \ engulfed by dust and thus have trouble with my breathing apparatus, one day. But\
  \ unencumbered as I was by both dog and mantelpiece, when I hurled myself out of\
  \ bed that morning, I was free to go along to the Town Hall without other duties\
  \ to distract me.\nI know nothing of architecture, but by God I recognise municipal\
  \ pride expressed in brick and concrete when I see it. I must have walked past the\
  \ Town Hall numberless times without paying it any attention. Now, I stopped on\
  \ the steps to take in its majestic frontage. Gosh. Feeling somewhat belittled,\
  \ I entered through the grand doorway. I did not have an appointment with anybody,\
  \ so when I presented myself at the reception desk I was treated with a certain\
  \ disdain. Perhaps I was mistaken for a mendicant. I suppose I ought to have washed\
  \ my hair and worn a less grubby cravat for what I considered a pretty momentous\
  \ visit. I was pointed towards a row of plastic chairs and told to sit and wait.\
  \ Before taking my seat, I browsed through a rack of leaflets affixed to the wall,\
  \ and took a few of them to pass the time.\nCoincidentally, the very first one I\
  \ read concerned Alderman Spandau, whose statue I had sat beside in the park. I\
  \ learned that his title of Alderman had no civic significance, but that he had\
  \ been so called because he was an expert, albeit an amateur one, on the subject\
  \ of alder trees, with which the park was riddled. I learned too that an enthusiasm\
  \ for trees ran in the family, and that he had a cousin, who also bore the name\
  \ of a German prison, who was known as Sycamoreman. Fascinating as all this was,\
  \ it had nothing to tell me of bins and park benches and signage and flowerbeds,\
  \ or of civic statuary in general, so I tucked the leaflet into an inner pocket\
  \ for safekeeping, and turned my attention to the next one in my clutch. It was\
  \ all about food poisoning. Again, not my immediate concern, though I noted it managed\
  \ to work in a mention of Alderman Spandau, claiming his death had been due to the\
  \ unwise ingestion of several contaminated eggs on toast. There was no reference\
  \ to his cousin, although yet another German prison was alluded to, for reasons\
  \ which I could not quite pin down. I replaced this leaflet in the rack. As I was\
  \ doing so, a council person emerged from behind a panel and approached me, his\
  \ hand held out in greeting.\nSeldom have I beheld such glistening buttons!\nThis\
  \ council person gave off a powerful reek of spam and hair oil, but I was impressed\
  \ by his politesse. As he led me up staircases and along corridors towards his office,\
  \ he explained that, following a rash of complaints about surliness and the grumps,\
  \ the municipal authorities had trained their entire workforce in the manners and\
  \ mores of the imperial court of Austria-Hungary circa 1844. This had worked wonders\
  \ in what he nevertheless termed the \u201Cpublic interface skillset\u201D. I couldn't\
  \ help thinking what Alderman Spandau would have made of it all, but then I remembered\
  \ that he was merely a tree enthusiast rather than a civic dignitary.\nI have not\
  \ looked into the matter, but I assume that the word dignitary comes from the same\
  \ root as dignity. This was a quality singularly lacking, I am afraid to say, among\
  \ the members of the current council administration, a framed photograph of whom\
  \ was prominently displayed on the wall of the office into which I was led. They\
  \ were pictured together in a field, lined up as if they were a sports team, and\
  \ each had a glassy-eyed stare. Each wore an unfortunate kagoul. I noticed there\
  \ was a dog\u2014mercifully unkagouled\u2014in the front row, and asked, joshingly,\
  \ if it, too, was a councillor, or just a mascot. To my surprise, the council person\
  \ replied that the dog, Skippy by name, was actually the Mayor of our bailiwick.\
  \ It had won more votes than all the other councillors put together.\n\u201CThe\
  \ rest of them are a complete shower,\u201D he said, brightly, \u201Cbut needs must\
  \ when the devil drives.\u201D\nI observed that, Skippy apart, they all looked as\
  \ if they had had their brains removed.\n\u201CLet us say\u2026 modified,\u201D\
  \ he replied.\nIntriguing as this revelation was, I did not want to waste time talking\
  \ about the councillors. I put it to the council person that I was ready and willing\
  \ to contribute, manfully and with gusto, to all matters pertaining to bins and\
  \ park benches and signage and flowerbeds and civic statuary, but that before I\
  \ could do so I needed to know more about them all. He made a great show of buffing\
  \ his buttons with a silken kerchief, and said:\n\u201COh, I wouldn't worry your\
  \ little potato-shaped head about such things. Skippy has everything under control.\u201D\
  \nThough reassured in terms of the maintenance of civic order, I was somewhat deflated.\
  \ Was there no way, I protested, that I could play the part of an active citizen?\
  \ I passed over the comment about the shape of my head, for I did not think it had\
  \ been meant unkindly, and, after all, my head is on the small side, and it resembles\
  \ a potato. This is often remarked upon by people, but usually at times when conversation\
  \ has fallen flat and they are desperately trying to think of something to say.\
  \ The council person had no such problem. Indeed, he began babbling a stream of\
  \ what I took to be boilerplate municipal jargon. It was unremittingly opaque, and\
  \ he must have noticed my eyes glazing over, for suddenly he grabbed me by the elbow\
  \ and ushered me towards the window.\n\u201CThere!\u201D, he shouted, pointing,\
  \ \u201CThat is what I'm talking about! The municipal monkey pound!\u201D\nI looked,\
  \ and sure enough, just past the car park and a clump of alder trees, there was\
  \ a pound, and it was full of monkeys. At ground level you would never have recognised\
  \ it, but from a high window up here in the civic empyrean there was no mistaking\
  \ it. I was rapt.\n\u201CExplain it to me again, this time without the jargon,\u201D\
  \ I said.\nThis, it seemed, was too much to ask. He insisted I would get the hang\
  \ of things, plopped a cap on my head and pinned a badge to my lapel. Five minutes\
  \ later, we were outside, at the electronic gate of the monkey pound, and he was\
  \ pressing a buzzer.\n\u201CAh, Chevenix!\u201D he said, as a civic functionary\
  \ emerged from a hut to open the gate, \u201CHere is our new volunteer.\u201D\n\
  And I was in. I was doing my bit for the council. Not as I had hoped to, in the\
  \ realm of bins and park benches and signage and flowerbeds and civic statuary,\
  \ but nonetheless I had my foot in the door. I was an active, civically-minded citizen.\n\
  Chevenix, the monkey pound supervisor, proved to be the most unfailingly helpful\
  \ person I have ever met, in any capacity. He gave me a brush to rid my volunteer's\
  \ cap of accumulated filth, and a rag to polish my volunteer's badge, and he took\
  \ me on a guided tour of the monkey pound, and told me more about it than any sane\
  \ person could wish to know.\nQuite unbeknown to me, our bailiwick had been plagued\
  \ for some years by monkeys, and not just any monkeys, but monkey vampires. These\
  \ were qualitatively different from vampire monkeys, I was given to understand,\
  \ but I am hazy on the details, and Chevenix soon passed on to other matters. The\
  \ monkey vampires had all been rounded up, from their nests and hiding places in\
  \ ginnels and air-vents and pavilions, and were impounded here in the pound behind\
  \ the car park and the clump of alder trees pending a decision on whether or not\
  \ they should be subject to extraordinary rendition. Skippy was mulling it over,\
  \ but it was low on his list of priorities. Some of those in the know wanted all\
  \ the monkey vampires to be put in a sealed train, like Lenin, and taken to the\
  \ Carpathians. Others preferred the idea of ferrying the monkey vampires, one by\
  \ one, to havens. There was even a body of opinion suggesting they be kept in the\
  \ municipal monkey pound in perpetuity. Chevenix did not divulge to me which, if\
  \ any, of these options had his backing. I supposed that, as a functionary, he had\
  \ to remain neutral.\nThe monkey vampires themselves were fascinating, at least\
  \ when visible. The pound was constructed with many tromple l'oeil gardenia bushes,\
  \ mazes, baffles and cubbies, and it was possible to walk round and round for hours\
  \ without seeing a single \u201Ccustomer\u201D, as the council insisted on calling\
  \ the impounded monkey vampires. Some, I was told, were velveteen, and thrashed\
  \ about in the darkness. Others threw pickle jars over the fence. When the moon\
  \ was full, there was keening. The smell was a mixture of gnats\u2019 blood and\
  \ marzipan and bilgewater. Crocuses, real ones, grew in patches here and there,\
  \ and sometimes very tiny, almost transparent, monkey vampires could be seen sucking\
  \ moisture from the buds. Chevenix had a sack stuffed with aerosol sprays which\
  \ he made judicious use of. Several of the monkey vampires had learned to count,\
  \ and were reportedly devising their own calendar. It had been noticed that no birds\
  \ ever flew over the pound with the exception of startled chaffinches. On a log,\
  \ a pot of paint with a much-dented lid acted as a lure. One of my fellow-volunteers,\
  \ a bedraggled harpy of advancing years, was in charge of brazil nuts.\nI hope to\
  \ be given my own little sphere of influence one day. I have not been home since\
  \ I got here. I sleep in a hammock in the corner of one of the mazes, and do my\
  \ ablutions in the paddling pool. I feed on brazil nuts left unattended by the harpy,\
  \ and suck moisture from crocuses.\nOne thing Chevenix did not tell me was that\
  \ the municipal monkey pound was built on the site of a paupers\u2019 graveyard.\
  \ I discovered this for myself, by a combination of sharp wits and cemetery erudition.\
  \ I have noticed unseemly traffic between the monkey vampires and the spirits of\
  \ long-dead paupers. It is going on all the time, at a lopsided angle to common\
  \ perception. My quandary is whether to tell Chevenix, or the council person, or\
  \ even Skippy the mayor, what I know.\n[2009-10-26]"
