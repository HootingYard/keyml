text: "One consequence of my recent problems with my eyes is that I am less inclined\
  \ to visit art galleries and exhibitions. Peering myopically at blurred canvases\
  \ is not entirely rewarding. Spending a few days in Amsterdam, however, I felt impelled\
  \ to visit the Rijksmuseum, and I am very pleased that I did. For it was in the\
  \ \u201CGolden Age\u201D galleries that I encountered the most magnificent painting\
  \ of a swan that I have ever seen.\n\nThis is The Threatened Swan by Jan Asselijn,\
  \ painted in 1650. As so often, the reproduction barely does justice to the original,\
  \ which has a gleaming, translucent whiteness even my poor eyes found spellbinding.\n\
  I saw many actual swans swanning around on the canals of Amsterdam, but none was\
  \ quite as magnificent as this one.\n[2016-11-26]"
