text: "It is traditional, at the turning of the year, for reader Mike Jennings to\
  \ update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. \u201C\
  It seems that 2011 has been a lean year indeed for Dobsonian scholarship,\u201D\
  \ writes Mr Jennings from the pompous land of his banishment. Nevertheless, he has\
  \ managed to track down eleven, or rather twelve, previously unidentified titles,\
  \ and he is once again to be commended for his thoroughness, not least in assigning\
  \ those pesky, but lovely, Bl\xF6tzmann Numbers to the pamphlets he has unearthed.\
  \ One day we might be able to work out their significance.\nThere are earlier listings\
  \ for pamphlets numbered 1 to 104, and pamphlets numbered 105 to 128. Please note\
  \ that, unless stated otherwise, all titles are out of print.\n129. The Dredging\
  \ Of The Canal At Gaarg On The Eve Of The Batcake-Akido Conference.\n130. Ducks\
  \ And Criminals And Well-Maintained Reservoirs.\n131. Eleven Essays On Reservoir\
  \ Maintenance, By One Who Knows.\n132. Things Beginning With B.\n133. On The Inadvisability\
  \ Of Taking Daytime Naps During The Unfolding Of Cataclysmic World Events.\n134.\
