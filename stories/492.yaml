text: "Beppo was banished to a pompous land where he knew nobody. At the docks, under\
  \ Kleig lights, for they disembarked from the boat in the middle of the night, his\
  \ chains were taken off by the skipper himself. Mussing Beppo's filthy hair, the\
  \ skipper reminded him that he was now in a land of much pomposity, and forbidden\
  \ to leave it for forty years.\nBeppo saw little pomp at the docks. He saw crates\
  \ and stevedores and container ships and much else one might expect to see at docks\
  \ in any land. Never having hung around any docks before now, Beppo was smitten\
  \ by the novelty of the sights and sounds and smells, and he stayed put. He sat\
  \ for hours on a bench on the docks watching ships and sailors and crates. He begged\
  \ for bloaters from the crews of smacks which brought their catch to the docks.\
  \ He found shelter under a neglected tarpaulin and rubbed unguent into those parts\
  \ of his flesh where the chains had chafed it. He gawped at floozies roaming the\
  \ docks in their satins and silks. A floozie with a cloche hat befriended him and\
  \ talked of the pomposity of the land beyond the docks.\nAfter one hundred days\
  \ at the docks, Beppo nerved himself to leave. His cloche hatted friend convinced\
  \ him to go to the capital city, where majestic buildings scraped the sky and the\
  \ blades of helicopters whirred and the paving slabs along the boulevards were free\
  \ of grime and grease. But she forgot to tell him about the pompous sentries at\
  \ the city gates whose lips curled in sneers at Beppo's approach.\nBeppo explained\
  \ that he had been banished from his own land and that he had come to the capital\
  \ city to get work piloting a helicopter. His plan, which he did not divulge to\
  \ the sentries, was to become fat and to grow a moustache and to pilot a helicopter\
  \ back to his own land where he hoped his new fat moustachioed appearance would\
  \ deceive his banishers.\nThe sentries chuckled pompously and marched Beppo off\
  \ to an area of disused railway infrastructure, where they tied him to the rails.\
  \ They got this idea from watching a number of silent film serials starring Pearl\
  \ White (1889\u20131938), including The Perils Of Pauline, The Exploits Of Elaine,\
  \ The Iron Claw, The Fatal Ring, The House Of Hate, and Plunder. The sentries overlooked\
  \ the fact that, the railway being disused, no locomotive would come hurtling towards\
  \ trapped Beppo as he struggled with the cords that bound him.\nThe sentries\u2019\
  \ knot-tying skills were lamentable, and Beppo managed to free himself within minutes.\
  \ Then he wandered off along the disused railway track, skirting the capital city.\
  \ He hoped to find a spot where he might breach the massive granite wall, a spot\
  \ without sentries and where a certain amount of crumblement had occurred.\nAlas!\
  \ When Beppo found such a spot he discovered that it was used as a conduit by feral,\
  \ zombie-like ruffians. These creatures had once been full citizens of the capital\
  \ city but had been shunned due to their lack of pomposity. They now lived in a\
  \ twilight world, staging raids into the city through the crumblement zone and setting\
  \ upon passing wayfarers outwith the wall, such as Beppo. They sheared the hair\
  \ off his head and sprinkled the cuttings on to the soup in their billycans. They\
  \ made him wear a foolish hat. They poked him with pointed sticks and drooled upon\
  \ him. His humiliations ceased at nightfall when searchlights from a patrolling\
  \ helicopter picked out the ruffians and made them flee. The helicopter landed in\
  \ an adjoining field and Beppo was bundled aboard.\nThe flight to the helipad in\
  \ the pompous capital city was a short one, but halfway there the helicopter was\
  \ engulfed in thick, thick fog, fog so thick that visibility was zero. On 15th December\
  \ 1944, Glenn Miller took off in an aeroplane from RAF Twinwood Farm in Bedfordshire,\
  \ en route to Paris. The aeroplane, and Miller, vanished without trace over the\
  \ English Channel. Beppo met a similar inexplicable fate.\nHe has a headstone in\
  \ the graveyard of the capital city of that pompous land. It is marked with an X,\
  \ and the earth beneath it holds no bones.\n[2008-07-22]"
