  \ was besotted with them. He would fairly skip along the twilit lanes to the appointed\
  \ field, where he would join his many, many equally potatotastic pals as they\n\
  Hang on. I was always under the impression that Dobson was a solitary sort, even\
  \ a recluse, sitting alone at his escritoire, with only Marigold Chew for company,\
  \ and she in a different room. This is the first I've heard of \u201Cmany, many\
  \ pals\u201D.\nAh. Well, Dobson was indeed an immensely popular figure, with friends\
  \ of all shapes and sizes scattered in bailiwicks near and far. What one has to\
  \ remember is that most of the time he shunned them. But they were a forgiving lot,\
  \ entranced, perhaps, by the honour of being counted among the so-called \u201C\
  pals of the pamphleteer\u201D. And so, at twilight on Wednesday potato nights, they\
  \ gathered in a field, a happy band, and\nThis all seems a bit dubious to me. One\
  \ minute Dobson is shunning his friends, as we might expect of him, and now he is\
  \ skipping along a lane with them, presumably with an idiot grin on his face and\
  \ flowers in his hair.\nYour presumptions are wrong, whoever you are. A man\u2014\
  even a pamphleteer\u2014can be happy without sporting an \u201Cidiot grin\u201D\
  . And flowers in the hair is your own invention. There is nothing to suggest Dobson\
  \ adopted such a hippy head decoration. As for shuttling back and forth between\
  \ the enshunment and the unshunment of his pals, how could it be otherwise if we\
  \ regard Dobson as fully human, with all the flaws and inconsistencies and non-hippy\
  \ headgear choices of an everyman? Now, gathering in the field, armed with their\
  \ potatoes and camping-gaz stoves and flasks of water, the enthusiasts watched the\
  \ last glimmers of sunlight vanish below the horizon, and ignited their torches\
  \ of petrol-soaked rags tied to the ends of sticks. Over yonder, sprites disported\
  \ themselves in the fug above the eerie marsh.\nWhat?\nOver yonder, sprites disported\
  \ themselves in the\nYes, I heard what you said. Surely a fug is something you get\
  \ in a confined space, like the fug of smoke in the saloon bar of the Cow & Pins\
  \ in the days before the smoking ban. You wouldn't get a fug over a marsh, however\
  \ eerie, unless of course these are cigar-smoking sprites you're talking about.\n\
  Pipe-smoking sprites, actually. And because there is no wind on Wednesday potato\
  \ nights, not even the hint of a breeze, the air above the eerie marsh is still,\
  \ and the smoke from the sprites\u2019 pipes hangs there, eerily, in a fug. And\
  \ Dobson and all his many pals stand in their field, torches lit, peering at the\
  \ marsh-fug, as if transfixed, before setting about their potato business. They\
  \ pour water from their flasks into pots, and they light the camping-gaz\nYou didn't\
  \ mention anything about pots before, when you listed what they brought with them.\
  \ Potatoes and camping-gaz stoves and flasks, you said. In fact, you didn't say\
  \ anything about the torches of petrol-soaked rags tied to the ends of sticks, until\
  \ they lit them. And you haven't explained what they lit them with. Matches? Zippo\
  \ lighters? I like detail, and you are not providing it. Would it not be better,\
  \ at the outset, to give us a comprehensive list of all the items these people were\
  \ carrying along the twilit lanes towards the fields, on Wednesday potato nights?\n\
  You want a comprehensive list?\nThat would be excellent! A catalogue, perhaps, with\
  \ a description of each item, and a catalogue number, and price, and an online shopping\
  \ basket and checkout, so that if I wanted to I could use my Hooting Yardcard\u2122\
  \ to actually buy the things. You would have to add pictures too, of course, in\
  \ colour.\nWell, that would take\nAnd while you're about it, a supplement to the\
  \ catalogue, inserted at the end, with similar details of the marsh sprites\u2019\
  \ pipes and pipe-smoking paraphernalia, for there are always various bits and bobs\
  \ a pipeist needs to enjoy a proper pipe-smoking experience, like pipe-cleaners,\
  \ for instance. And even though it is just a supplement, not part of the main catalogue\
  \ per se, it should have a similar level of detail, with photographs of all the\
  \ pipe-cleaners and so on, in colour.\nThat is rather a lot of work.\nYes, I grant\
  \ you that. But has it not occurred to you that this is the kind of thing your readers\
  \ are crying out for? It's all very well blathering on about a pamphleteer and his\
  \ supposed unshunned pals boiling potatoes in a field in the night, but we want\
  \ to be able to recreate these scenes in the comfort of our own community hub fenced-off\
  \ frolicking compounds, and we need the kit to be able to do so. Think of the money\
  \ you could make!\nWell, I suppose the main catalogue wouldn't be too much of a\
  \ problem. Time-consuming and a bit finicky, but I could do it. Whereas the supplement\
  \ would be much more difficult. Have you ever tried to take a photograph of a pipeist\
  \ sprite above an eerie marsh?\nI can't say that I have.\nI would need a spirit\
  \ camera. Ordinary cameras would be worse than useless, all you would see would\
  \ be a grey blur.\nA blur will do, I'm not fussy. I can study the photographs using\
  \ my etheric eerie marsh spriteoscope. Buy one, get one free at Hubermann's.\nSo\
  \ in essence, all your interruptions have been leading up to a blatant advertisement\
  \ for that confounded department store? That's despicable.\nMaybe so, but as you\
  \ know, Hubermann's is a byword for utter gorgeousness.\n[2009-02-12]"
