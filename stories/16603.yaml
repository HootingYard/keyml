text: "Immediately adjacent to the Duntblau Wool Shop, on the main shopping parade,\
  \ is the Duntblau Nougat Parlour. This is the chief source of nougat, not only in\
  \ Duntblau, but for miles around.\nThe proprietor of the Nougat Parlour is a fellow\
  \ called Jukka-Pekka [Illegible], who can best be described as a \u201Ccapsized\
  \ man\u201D. That is how he was referred to in the most authoritative book on the\
  \ subject, Pen-Portraits Of The Proprietors Of The Duntblau Nougat Parlour, From\
  \ Its Foundation In 1882 To The Present Day.\nThe illegibility of his surname is\
  \ but one, telling, sign of his capsized nature. Add to that the fact that he is\
  \ often to be found upside down and soaking wet, even when behind the counter selling\
  \ nougat to the more confectionery-bedazzled citizens of Duntblau.\nHis history\
  \ is curious, if shadowy. It is also dark, sweeping, flinty, error-strewn, piquant,\
  \ lode-bearing, toffee-nosed, hip, hep, and hapless. Some claim it is tacky. Whichever\
  \ words are used to describe his history, they pale in comparison to the pencil-drawings\
  \ and diagrams which often accompany them. Many, if not most of these were executed\
  \ at a single marathon session by Duntblau's civic penciliste, Maisie Binns.\nMaisie\
  \ Binns herself is a woman without a history.\n\u201COne day she was just there,\u201D\
  \ reported the town blabbermouth, \u201CSitting on a chair near the shopping parade,\
  \ scribbling in her sketchpad with a pencil. It was as if she had simply dropped\
  \ from heaven. The pencil whizzed over the paper, she turned out drawings and diagrams\
  \ with a felicity that can only be marvelled at. She was there, and then, just as\
  \ suddenly, pfft!, she was gone. They say we shall not see her like again, but this\
  \ is incorrect, as a second penciliste will be appearing shortly, God willing, if\
  \ my prayers have been answered. And why should they not be?\u201D\nThere is something\
  \ dismal about Duntblau once one wanders far from the shopping parade. Any sense\
  \ of civic oomph is dispelled the further away one is from wool and nougat. But\
  \ I suppose the same could be said of virtually any cluster of buildings, any human\
  \ settlement, in any of the districts of any of the regions in any of the countries\
  \ in any of the continents on any of the planets in any of the solar systems.\n\
  It cannot be said of the seas. The seas are very different from the lands. The seas\
  \ are soaking wet, and riddled with fish, and cephalopods, and huge aquatic monsters\
  \ which suddenly crash to the surface and overturn our puny human boats, capsizing\
  \ them, and all who sail in them.\n[2018-09-16]"
