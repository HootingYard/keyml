  Meanwhile, over at The Dabbler, you can find a seasonal tale exhumed from the Archives.\
  \ Devoted readers will probably have it by heart, and be ready to recite it to the\
  \ tinies at bedtime, but I learned that apparently there are a few visitors to The\
  \ Dabbler who have not spent the past six months poring over the accumulated treasures\
  \ of Hooting Yard (2003\u20132010), so we must help them get up to speed before\
  \ the new year.\n[2010-12-24]"
