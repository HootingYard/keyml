  \ and well-born (\u201CAll our family go to Heaven\u201D), Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence\
  \ became treasurer of the WPSU. Like other Suffragettes she had previously been\
  \ engaged in a bizarre form of Edwardian philanthropy, the endeavour to restore\
  \ to the brutalized urban masses their lost sense of the pulsating joy of Merrie\
  \ England by means of folk songs and Morris dances.\nIs it too late to try this\
  \ again?\n\n[2012-08-28]"
