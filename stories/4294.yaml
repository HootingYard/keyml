text: "In considering this subject with the attention that is due to it, it has appeared\
  \ to me that all the stories of ghosts and super, or, un-natural appearances, may\
  \ be referred to some of the following causes:\n1. To the augmentation produced\
  \ by fear in any effect on the senses\u2014thus the ear of a terrified man will\
  \ convert the smallest noise into the report of thunder, or his eye will change\
  \ the stump of a tree into a monster twenty feet high. As the senses are furnished\
  \ for protection, their irritability, under the impression of fear, is part of their\
  \ economy, as the means of preserving our being; but it is absurd to refer back\
  \ the effects thus augmented, to external causes which might be capable of producing\
  \ the augmentation. To such an error of the senses and of reasoning, is, however,\
  \ to be referred half the ghosts and supernaturals of which we hear in village ale-houses,\
  \ in nurseries and schools.\n2. To diseased organs of sensation; as an inflamed\
  \ eye producing the effect of flashes of light in the dark, or fulness of blood\
  \ producing a ringing or singing in the ears. Sometimes diseases of the visual organs\
  \ are accompanied by hallucinations of mind; and persons ill in fevers often see\
  \ successions of figures and objects flit before their eyes till the disease has\
  \ been removed. The workings of conscience or nervous affections will also produce\
  \ diseases of the senses, and such hallucinations of mind as to occasion a person\
  \ to fancy he sees another, or to be haunted by him. But there is nothing supernatural\
  \ in all this; it is sometimes a local disease, sometimes an effect of fever, sometimes\
  \ a nervous affection, and sometimes partial insanity.\n3. To natural causes not\
  \ understood by the parties. Thus, anciently the northern lights were mistaken for\
  \ armies fighting; meteors and comets for flaming swords, portending destruction\
  \ or pestilence; the electrified points of swords to the favour of heaven; the motions\
  \ of the\_ planets to attractive effluvia; and all the effects of the comixture\
  \ of the gases to benign or diabolical agency, as they happened to produce on the\
  \ parties good or evil. So in the like manner old houses are generally said to be\
  \ haunted, owing to the noises which arise from the cracking and yielding of their\
  \ walls and timbers, and from the protection and easy passage which in the course\
  \ of time they afford to rats, mice, weasels, &c. whose activity in the night-time\
  \ affords the foundation of numerous apprehensions and fancies of the credulous.\n\
  4. To spontaneous combustions or detonations, which produce occasional lights and\
  \ noises, or, under unchanged circumstances, recurring lights and noises, chiefly\
  \ claiming attention in the night. Thus houses shut up and unaired are apt, from\
  \ the putrefaction of animal and vegetable matter, to generate hydrogen gas, the\
  \ accidental combustion of which by contact with phosphoric matter, naturally generated\
  \ in the same situation, will produce those effects of lights and noises heard in\_\
  \ empty houses. So Church-yards, Churches in which the dead are buried, Cemeteries,\
  \ and Ruins of old buildings, must frequently give out large quantities of these\
  \ gases; and consequently, from exactly similar causes, they are likely to produce\
  \ the very effects which we witness in the will-o\u2019-the-wisp, or in hydrogen\
  \ gas when inflamed during calm weather in marshy situations.\n5. To the prevailing\
  \ belief that effects, which cannot readily be accounted for, or which are caused\
  \ by the contact of the invisible fluids or media always in action in the great\
  \ laboratory of nature, are produced by the agency of spirits or demons; which belief,\
  \ concurring with the unknown causes of the effects, and affording a ready solution\
  \ of difficulties, prevents further inquiry, silences reasoning, and tends in consequence\
  \ to sustain the prevailing errors and superstitions.\nSuch are the general causes\
  \ of ghosts, spirits, charms, miracles, and supernatural appearances. They all arise\
  \ either from hallucinations of the mind or senses;\_ from the mutual action of\
  \ the natural, though invisible, powers of gaseous and ethereal fluids; from the\
  \ delusions of ignorance, implicit faith, or the absence of all reasoning.\nSir\
