text: "This being an Olympic year, it is perhaps time to scotch a rumour that has\
  \ swirled persistently around the world of fictional athletics for decades. You\
  \ will recall that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol is alleged to have left a written\
  \ record of the gifts he received one Christmastide from his all too real coach,\
  \ Old Halob. If we are to credit this list, the wily and cantankerous chain smoker\
  \ had, by the twelfth day of Christmas, presented his prot\xE9g\xE9 with\u2014and\
  \ it would be well to take a deep breath here\u2014no fewer than a dozen apiece\
  \ of vipers, shrews, bees, and gormless orphans, twenty-two cardboard pigs and the\
  \ same number of cornflake cartons, thirty each of poptarts and rusty nozzles, thirty-six\
  \ dead chaffinches and thirty-six paper sickbags, forty tufts of bindweed, plus\
  \ forty-two hideous bat gods, forty-two mordant herons, and an incalculable amount\
  \ of ectoplasm. I think I have done my sums correctly, but please check them if\
  \ you don't trust me.\nNow, what sane person would give somebody such an array of\
  \ gifts? And let us be quite clear that no non-fictional athletics coach was ever\
  \ as sane as Old Halob, in spite of the chain smoking, the strangulated catarrh-racked\
  \ coughing, the trenchcoat, the Homburg hat, and the irascible demeanour. Sporty\
  \ historian Prudence Cindertrack confirms as much when she writes \u201Cthe thing\
  \ about Old Halob was that no brain doctor ever succeeded in having him sectioned\
  \ to a madhouse\u201D. I wish I could lay my hands on the source of that reference,\
  \ but right this minute I can't for the life of me remember in which of Miss Cindertrack's\
  \ sporty bagatelles I read it, so, just like my sums, you will have to take it on\
  \ trust.\nOf course, the authenticity of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's list was\
  \ called into question. Leaving aside his fictional status, it was inconceivable\
  \ to many that he could ever have found time to put pen to paper, when the rigorous\
  \ training regime instituted by Old Halob had him sprinting round and round and\
  \ round a running track in all the hours God sends, except for those hours when\
  \ he was bidden to pole-vault repeatedly over a wooden bar set ever and ever higher.\
  \ Even if he was occasionally granted a breather, he would have been shaking with\
  \ exhaustion and terror and unable to grasp a pen or pencil or even a crayon in\
  \ his fictional fist.\nFor the rumour-mongers, however, these germane points could\
  \ be swept aside much as an ogre might sweep aside a gnat. (I have borrowed that\
  \ simile from Prudence Cindertrack, who employs it more than once in her entertaining\
  \ Reader's Digest article on the sport of gnat-swatting. I am afraid I can't remember\
  \ which issue of the magazine her piece appeared in. You might be able to find it\
  \ in your local library, if it keeps a full run of bound volumes of Reader's Digest,\
  \ perhaps in the cellar or boiler-room.)\nThe first inkling that somebody believed\
  \ Old Halob really had given fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol twelve vipers, twelve\
  \ shrews, twelve bees, twenty-two cardboard pigs, thirty poptarts, thirty-six dead\
  \ chaffinches, forty-two hideous bat gods, forty-two mordant herons, forty tufts\
  \ of bindweed, thirty-six paper sickbags, thirty rusty nozzles, twenty-two cornflake\
  \ cartons, twelve gormless orphans, and an incalculable amount of ectoplasm in a\
  \ twelve-day period came when sporty priest Father \u201CSpikes\u201D Vestnumber\
  \ gave a sermon before a vast crowd gathered in a large and important stadium. Let\
  \ us remind ourselves of what he said by quoting from Prudence Cindertrack's contemporary\
  \ newspaper report.\nThe vast crowd in this large and important stadium gasped as\
  \ one when Father \u201CSpikes\u201D Vestnumber declared that the reason fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol kept winning so many sprint races and pole-vaulting events\
  \ was because his coach, Old Halob, was practising a blasphemous form of fictional\
  \ athletics coaching based on voodoo. He challenged Old Halob to deny the charge,\
  \ in public, before a vast crowd in a large and important stadium, while tethered\
  \ to a post and undergoing an exorcism, with lots of poking with pointy sticks,\
  \ dousing with holy water, and the insertion of burning incense sticks into various\
  \ orifices. By the time the priest finished shouting, the crowd had been provoked\
  \ into a seething angry mob, baying for the death of the legendary non-fictional\
  \ athletics coach.\nI should point out here that Miss Cindertrack's report was cut\
  \ to ribbons by an overenthusiastic sub-editor, and I have reconstructed the gist\
  \ of her piece from memory and by communicating with the spirit realm.\nOld Halob,\
  \ being Old Halob, took absolutely no notice of the man he would no doubt have dismissed\
  \ as \u201Ca turbulent priest\u201D had he been capable of coherent speech in between\
  \ expectorating copious amounts of phlegm, sputum, and bile into his surprisingly\
  \ dainty napkin. But as I indicated at the beginning, the rumours have never gone\
  \ away, and you will still hear, at sporty gatherings, somebody or other casually\
  \ referring to \u201COld Halob, the voodoo athletics coach\u201D. What these rascals\
  \ never bother to explain is to precisely what voodoo use the collected items\u2014\
  plus an incalculable amount of ectoplasm\u2014were meant to be put. From my breathtakingly\
  \ encyclopaedic knowledge of voodoo\u2014garnered in the main from a series of feature\
  \ articles by Prudence Cindertrack in the scholarly journal Chaps In Shorts Running\
  \ And Jumping And Throwing Things\u2014it seems to me that the feathers and innards\
  \ of dead chaffinches might come in handy, as might tufts of bindweed, and, at a\
  \ push, mordant herons and orphans, and perhaps paper sickbags, but as for the rest\
  \ of the stuff, it serves no imaginable voodoo purpose whatsoever, although some\
  \ might argue that cardboard pigs, and the cardboard from cornflake cartons, and\
  \ indeed bat gods and nozzles and poptarts, not to mention vipers and shrews and\
  \ bees and ectoplasm, have their part to play in some of the more arcane manifestations\
  \ of voodoo practice, particularly, it must be said, in the field of fictional athletics,\
  \ when performed by a non-fictional athletics coach.\nI am glad we have cleared\
  \ that up once and for all.\n[2012-01-08]"
