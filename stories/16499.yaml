text: "Ornithology, when pursued recklessly, breaks bones. This aper\xE7u first appeared\
  \ in Dobson's pamphlet Oh! One Merry March Morning I Climbed A Tree The Better To\
  \ Investigate, At Close Quarters, The Nest Of A Wren And, Losing My Footing, I Plunged\
  \ To Earth, Landing Awkwardly And In So Doing Broke My Collarbone, Subsequently,\
  \ In Making My Report To The Triage Nurse, I Blamed The Wren, I Blamed The Wren!\
  \ (out of print).\nOf late, there has been something of a kerfuffle in Dobsonist\
  \ circles occasioned by the publication of a new monograph on the pamphlet. Upstart\
  \ young Scandinavian critic Knud Pantryboy argues, in his essay, that there is not\
  \ a jot of truth in the pamphleteer's hysterical prose. Controversially, he suggests\
  \ that Dobson was making a stab at writing a piece of fiction.\nDobson never climbed\
  \ a tree in his life, writes the hot-headed Dane, and he would certainly have been\
  \ unable to distinguish the nest of a wren from that of any other of the approximately\
  \ ten thousand, four hundred and four types of birds, many of them extinct, which\
  \ grace, or have graced, the blue skies of the ever-rotating globe we call the Earth.\n\
  Pantryboy also makes the point that no evidence exists to suggest Dobson's collarbone\
  \ was ever broken. He dismisses as \u201Cobviously fraudulent\u201D the pencil sketches,\
  \ purportedly based on X-rays, which appeared in the compendium Pencil Sketches\
  \ Based On X-Rays Of The Bones Of Several Twentieth-Century Writers compiled by\
  \ the quack medical illustrator Tosh Quackpencil. The half-dozen sketches of Dobson's\
  \ collarbone each show signs of traumatic shattering, but Pantryboy argues, persuasively,\
  \ that the pictures were executed during a thunderstorm.\nWhy, though, would Dobson\
  \ have risked his reputation by inventing this tale? While admitting that he does\
  \ not know the answer to this question, Knud Pantryboy suggests that the narrative\
  \ is a veiled reference to a singular episode in the pamphleteer's childhood.\n\
  The \u201Ctree\u201D is a picnic blanket. The \u201Cwren's nest\u201D is a sausage-on-a-stick.\
  \ The \u201Cplunge to earth\u201D is a fit of hiccups. The \u201Ccollarbone\u201D\
  \ is another sausage on another stick. The \u201Ctriage nurse\u201D is International\
  \ Woman of Mystery Primrose Dent. I rest my case.\nIt is undoubtedly true that La\
  \ Dent used to appear, uninvited, at innumerable picnic spots throughout what Lumsden\
  \ called \u201Cthat brittle, squalid decade\u201D. True, too, that it was both brittle\
  \ and squalid. And equally true that Lumsden himself had his posthumous bones sketched,\
  \ from X-rays, by Tosh Quackpencil. Nor should we ever forget that wrens, when gathered\
  \ in huge numbers, can be extremely dangerous. Ornithology, when pursued recklessly,\
  \ does indeed break bones.\n[2018-04-30]"
