text: "I keep all my eggs in one basket. I have several baskets, obtained during what\
  \ I like to think of as my \u201Cbasket-acquiring years\u201D, but there is only\
  \ one in which I put my eggs. This is a small, oval, wicker basket, a bit tatty\
  \ with age, which I keep on one side of the countertop in my kitchen. My other baskets\
  \ I use for a number of different purposes, in different parts of the house, and\
  \ outside. One purpose to which they are never, ever put is for the keeping of eggs.\
  \ The eggs always go in their designated basket.\nI usually buy half a dozen eggs\
  \ at one time. Invariably, they come packaged in a cardboard egg-carton specifically\
  \ designed for the storage of eggs. Some people are happy to leave the eggs in the\
  \ carton once they get them home. That is their choice and it is not one with which\
  \ I would argue, unless I was in a frantic and fractious frame of mind and, at the\
  \ end of my tether, looking for a pretext to blow my top and indulge in a violent\
  \ argument. Shouting my head off about the pros and cons of different egg storage\
  \ possibilities can be a splendid way to let off steam. In general, though, I tolerate\
  \ the practice of leaving the eggs in the carton you bought them in, so long as\
  \ my own preference for putting my eggs in a basket is accepted in return. It usually\
  \ is.\nIt would be a mistake to think that six is the maximum number of eggs in\
  \ my basket. I make it my habit to buy a new carton of eggs when there is still\
  \ one egg, or even two, in the basket. Thus the maximum number is seven or eight.\
  \ When adding the newly-bought half dozen eggs, what I do is to remove, temporarily,\
  \ the one or two eggs remaining in the basket, put the fresh eggs in, carefully,\
  \ and then place the one or two older eggs, even more carefully, on top of the clutch.\
  \ If I did not do this, the same one or two eggs would always remain at the bottom,\
  \ and might never get used, and they would rot, from the inside, unbeknown to me\
  \ until such time as I cracked the shell and released an unutterable Lovecraftian\
  \ stench.\nPlacing the one or two older eggs atop the clutch is not without risk,\
  \ of course. When removing them temporarily from the basket, I cannot simply place\
  \ them on the countertop. If I were to do that, they might, being egg-shaped, roll\
  \ all the way off the countertop and smash upon the floor. Mopping up egg innards\
  \ and shattered shell is never a pleasant business. Thus I first lay out a tea-towel\
  \ on the countertop, and put the older eggs on that, to avert any rolling. It has\
  \ been suggested that I might temporarily place the older eggs in one of my other\
  \ baskets. Superficially attractive as that may be, I loathe the very idea. As I\
  \ insisted at the outset, I like to keep my eggs in one basket.\nOne great advantage\
  \ of my system is that I have an empty egg carton to muck about with. Judicious\
  \ use of scissors and paint and glue can transform the carton into a few hats for\
  \ gnomes. There are lots of other things you can do with empty egg cartons, of course,\
  \ but that is the one I always return to. My gnomes are always losing their hats\
  \ in high winds.\nNow. A terrible thing happened last week. I was at a swish cocktail\
  \ party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, when I heard, above the hubbub,\
  \ a snatch of conversation. One of the guests, in a voice as strident as a corncrake's,\
  \ said \u201CWell, you know what they say, never keep all your eggs in one basket\u201D\
  . It is hard to describe the effect these words had on me. They came with the force\
  \ of a thunderclap. I felt unmoored from all that was familiar, all I held dear,\
  \ all I knew. \u201CThey\u201D? Who were \u201Cthey\u201D, who said this, with such\
  \ confidence, such authority? Steadying myself against the mantelpiece, I stood\
  \ on tiptoe, craning my neck to peer over the heads of the partygoers, trying to\
  \ see who it was who had said these awful, hideous words.\nThere could be only one\
  \ culprit. He sounded like a corncrake, and he looked like a corncrake, and now\
  \ he was saying something about not counting chickens. I clutched at the mantelpiece,\
  \ fearing I would swoon. No man should be allowed to live who could utter such things.\
  \ My head throbbing, I felt in my pocket for my stiletto. Damn .. . . it was not\
  \ there. Panicked, I rummaged in my other pockets, in vain. Then I remembered that\
  \ I had left my stiletto at home, in one of my other baskets, the big, blood-soaked\
  \ one, the one in which I keep my stilettos and knives and hatchets and axes and\
  \ slicers and shivs.\nSource\_: Me And My Eggs, by the lumbering walrus-moustached\
