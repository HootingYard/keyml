text: "Two of the answers in today's Guardian crossword were SPECKLE and SPLODGE.\
  \ This put me in mind of Dobson's pamphlet A Comparative Study Of Speckles And Splodges\
  \ And Smudges (out of print). It is one of his most exasperating works. The exasperation\
  \ lies, in the words of the critic Rappa Kohoutek, in the fact that\nDobson opens\
  \ with the grand statement that \u201Cthe speckle, the splodge, and the smudge are\
  \ each of them wholly discrete and different phenomena, and to muddle them up is\
  \ not merely ignorance, but dangerous ignorance. Wars have been fought, and men\
  \ have died, for failure to distinguish between the three\u201D. This is exasperating\
  \ on two counts. First, in the eighty pages of microscopically tiny print that follow,\
  \ the pamphleteer himself neglects to explain the difference between speckles and\
  \ splodges and smudges. Second, nor does he provide a single example of the war\
  \ and death he so melodramatically warns the reader of and I am going to let this\
  \ sentence run on because I hate to end with a preposition even though to do so\
  \ is completely defensible unless one is up against the most rigorous of pedants\
  \ armed, as certain pedants are, with a hammer of correction.\nIt is perhaps worth\
  \ noting here that Rappa Kohoutek bore several dents in his head, made by one such\
  \ \u201Chammer of correction\u201D wielded by a particularly rigorous pedant whose\
  \ path he used to cross occasionally. The critic liked to spend his mornings at\
  \ a sophisticated pavement caf\xE9 sipping from a glass of bengkht. Along the pavement\
  \ would come the pedant with his hammer, lashing out with what used to be called\
  \ \u201Cgay abandon\u201D.\nThe dents in his head did not effect Rappa Kohoutek's\
  \ critical acumen, however, and we must agree with his judgement about this particular\
  \ Dobson pamphlet. In a sense, we have no option but to agree with him, and trust\
  \ him, because we are never likely to read the work itself. As he points out, the\
  \ text of the pamphlet is microscopically tiny, and he is not exaggerating. It is\
  \ so tiny that the average reader would ruin their eyesight before getting to the\
  \ end of the preface and acknowledgements. Rappa Kohoutek explains in an afterword\
  \ to his own essay that he was able to read all eighty pages of text because his\
  \ sense of vision was inexplicably enhanced by one of the blows to the head he received\
  \ from the pedant's hammer of correction. In a further afterword to a second printing\
  \ of his essay, the critic relates how a subsequent blow from the same hammer restored\
  \ his sight to its previous mild myopia:\nAnd so I shall never again be able to\
  \ read Dobson's pamphlet on speckles and splodges and smudges. But quite frankly,\
  \ why on earth would I want to? It is absolute drivel.\nA hugely magnified copy\
  \ of Dobson's pamphlet has been made available by the Dobson Pamphlet Magnification\
  \ Commission, but so tiny is the text that in spite of the hugeness of the magnification\
  \ it is still pretty much illegible to any human eye.\n[2014-08-05]"
