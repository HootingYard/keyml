text: "Once upon a time there was a clucking thing. It was made of wire and wax and\
  \ string and it made a clucking noise when you pressed a knob. The knob was located\
  \ on what might have been its head. I say \u201Cmight have been\u201D because the\
  \ thing didn't really have a head, not a proper head, like my head or your head.\
  \ It was a sort of boxy shape, this thing. The knob was set over to one side on\
  \ the very upper part of it, which tapered slightly. That is why I said \u201Chead\u201D\
  , because the knob was on the upper part, to give you some idea. Were the knob set\
  \ lower, as low as could be, I could have said it was located on the thing's foot,\
  \ even though it did not have a foot, or feet, not as such.\nIt was not a mobile\
  \ thing. If you wanted to move it, you had to pick it up and put it where you wanted\
  \ it to be and it would stay there until you picked it up again and moved it somewhere\
  \ else. It did not make a clucking sound unless you pressed the knob.\nIt was yellow.\n\
  It was yellow except for the knob, which was red, or perhaps orange. Also, its underside\
  \ was beige. But its underside was almost always resting on the floor, and so was\
  \ not visible. If you picked it up and rested it on its side, or\u2014in a moment\
  \ of hysteria\u2014upside down, it did not cluck when you pressed the knob, no matter\
  \ how hard and insistently and repeatedly you pressed the knob. It had to be placed\
  \ upright, with the beige part on the floor.\nIt was roughly the same size as a\
  \ big duck.\nIf you placed a microphone next to it, to amplify the clucking sound\
  \ when you pressed the knob, the proximity of the microphone created some sort of\
  \ feedback. Then the thing howled, a terrifying ear-splitting howl, whether or not\
  \ you were pressing the knob. It would continue howling until you moved the microphone\
  \ somewhere else, further away, preferably into a different room, or even into a\
  \ different building. After howling, the thing would take some time to settle itself\
  \ before pressing its knob would make it cluck. Immediately after howling, when\
  \ you pressed the knob the thing would wheeze. You would probably have to wait about\
  \ five minutes before it would cluck again properly,\nThe thing did not do anything\
  \ else except cluck, howl, or wheeze. It fulfilled no higher purpose. Unless you\
  \ were particularly fond of boxy yellow immobile things, it did not really prettify\
  \ a room, like a vase of brilliant flowers, or a framed picture of a parson skating\
  \ on a frozen pond.\nIt was not the only thing of its kind in the world. At the\
  \ last count there were something like twenty million of them. Most of them, the\
  \ things that cluck when you press the knob, were buried in landfill sites. Human\
  \ ingenuity can be immensely befuddling.\n[2013-10-03]"
