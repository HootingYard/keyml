text: "\nIt's quiz time, readers! Limber up those cranial integuments and see if you\
  \ can answer the following brain-teaser:\nWho wrote these words?\n\u201COur phaeton\
  \ was a small, white, swan-shaped carriage, ornamented with golden designs, and\
  \ propelled by a galvanic battery in the graceful swan-head, which at my request\
  \ took the place of the ordinary steed. This was, to me, an exceedingly novel mode\
  \ of travel, which my short sojourn in the spirit world had prevented me from before\
  \ enjoying.\u201D\nWas it\_: A) Washington Irving, or B) the spirit-form of Washington\
  \ Irving, transmitting its thoughts by mysterious means from its habitation in ethereal\
  \ realms?\nYou will find a clue to the correct answer through a careful reading\
  \ of the contents of my cupboard in today's Dabbler.\nMeanwhile, here at Hooting\
  \ Yard, I will have a few things to say about the important topic of galvanic batteries\
  \ embedded in the graceful heads of swans, soon, soon.\n[2011-01-28]"
