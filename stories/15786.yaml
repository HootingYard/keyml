text: "\nIt is a curious fact that throughout his long life, Lars Talc's dreams had\
  \ only ever been sweet, even twee. He had never experienced a nightmare. We know\
  \ this because he wrote about it at length in his book The Brink Of Cramp & Other\
  \ Essays. As the Pig Battery steamed south, he dreamed again of fragrant petunia-decked\
  \ meadows, gambolling bunny rabbits, miraculous angels plucking on harps, pretty\
  \ balloons, sandcastles, blissful dawns.\n\u201CHow nauseating!\u201D he thundered\
  \ in his essay, \u201CTo be held rapt, night after night after night, by visions\
  \ so sickly sentimental. And yet, in sleep, to relish them, to feel such exultation\
  \ at images which, in my waking life, I, a Finn, an intellektuelli, a man of the\
  \ world, would castigate as the contemptible poltrooneries of babes and cretins!\
  \ I have come to have the gravest doubts about myself,\u201D he continued, \u201C\
  I have teetered on the verge of spiritual despair.\u201D\nHe tried everything in\
  \ hopeless attempts to induce nightmares. He abandoned his comfortable bed for a\
  \ pallet of straw. He drank to excess, or drank nothing at all. He burned sulphur\
  \ in his bedroom. Before retiring, he ate the most noxious cheeses he could lay\
  \ his hands on. He read terrifying stories of violence, horror, and chaos. Nothing\
  \ worked, and eventually, in his seventies, he surrendered, accepted his namby-pamby\
  \ dreamworld, and found a kind of peace. \u201CI came to terms with myself,\u201D\
  \ he wrote, \u201CI was forced to concede that within my very soul, in that secret\
  \ world of dreams wherein lies the engine of our being, I liked nothing better than\
  \ to frolic in a sun-plashed garden with kitty-cats and puppy-dogs. I was, I realised,\
  \ a simple-minded h\xF6lmo, a hullu, a wert.\u201D\nWithin hours, the Pig Battery\
  \ reached an islet at which Lars Talc disembarked. One of the crew took him to shore\
  \ in a powerful motorboat, then swam back to the packet steamer. Once he had conducted\
  \ his business, Talc was to return alone to Marseilles in the motorboat and leave\
  \ it in the safe keeping of the captain's nephew, a small, curdled lad who ground\
  \ bones to dust in the basement of the naval hospital. The Pig Battery steamed off\
  \ south, bound for the Antarctic.\nMaking sure the motorboat was tied securely to\
  \ a post, Lars Talc checked Bewg's map. This must be the place. To his right, a\
  \ clump of bracken; to his left, a post office; straight ahead, a well. This last\
  \ was what he sought. As he approached it, however, a woman sprang out at him, brandishing\
  \ a lance. She was beribboned and festooned with braids, and wore a terrifying mask\
  \ of tin and gold. Talc stopped in his tracks.\n\u201CI am the Captain of the Well.\u201D\
  \ she announced, \u201CThis lance is tipped with venom, so be very careful. What\
  \ business have you here?\u201D\n\u201CI have come from Finland,\u201D said Talc,\
  \ \u201CHave any other Finns been here recently?\u201D\n\u201CI ask the questions,\u201D\
  \ she rapped, and shook her lance.\n\u201CI have reason to believe that a Finn\u2014\
  a very tall Finn\u2014has secreted at the bottom of your well a little packet. I\
  \ have come to retrieve it.\u201D\n\u201CDo you wish to go to the toilet?\u201D\
  \ she asked.\n\u201CNot at the moment.\u201D\n\u201CI ask because our islet is blessed\
  \ with three toilets. One of them is just behind the post office over there.\u201D\
  \ She waved her lance appropriately. \u201CThat is the Big Toilet. It is the one\
  \ most popular with foreigners, perhaps because it is so close to the beach. The\
  \ proper Foreigners\u2019 Toilet is on the other side of the islet. Not far, it\
  \ takes only a few minutes to walk there. We prefer foreigners to use that one,\
  \ hence its name.\u201D\n\u201CAnd where is the third toilet?\u201D asked Lars Talc,\
  \ feigning interest.\n\u201CWait, wait. I told you, it is I who ask the questions.\
  \ If you are patient, I will tell you about the third toilet. But I have yet to\
  \ finish telling you about the Foreigners\u2019 Toilet. This poisoned lance belies\
  \ the fact that we are a welcoming people on this islet. So, we let visitors use\
  \ the Big Toilet if they wish to, even though we would prefer them to use the Foreigners\u2019\
  \ Toilet, outside which is a signboard on which the word TOILET is written in every\
  \ language used on earth, including some of the dead ones.\u201D\n\u201CIt must\
  \ be a big board.\u201D\n\u201CEveryone on this island has minuscule handwriting\
  \ but, yes, the board is gigantic. And now I will tell you about the third toilet.\
  \ It is at a mid-point between the other two toilets, surrounded by tungsten railings.\
  \ For that reason we call it the Tungsten Toilet, although there were a few recalcitrants\
  \ who called it the Pewter Toilet, because the toilet itself is made of pewter.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI see,\u201D said Talc.\n\u201CThey were summarily executed.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Who were?\u201D\n\u201CFor the umpteenth time, do not question me. I was about to\
  \ tell you. The recalcitrants were executed. By me. With my lance.\u201D\nThe Captain\
  \ of the Well held her lance to Talc's throat, reminding him of his peril.\n\u201C\
  Well,\u201D he mumbled, \u201CI don't want to go to the toilet at the moment, but\
  \ thank you for the information.\u201D\n\u201CI have not finished telling you about\
  \ the Tungsten Toilet. It may interest you to know why it is protected by railings.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI think I'd rather investigate the well.\u201D\n\u201CAs you wish. Here\
  \ is a little map showing you how to get to the Foreigners\u2019 Toilet should you\
  \ need to visit it during your stay. There is a little box outside for donations.\
  \ If you have any trinkets or gewgaws in your pockets the people of the islet would\
  \ be grateful.\u201D\nAnd with that, the Captain of the Well stole away, towards\
  \ the clump of bracken. She was soon out of sight.\nTalc sat down on a little bench\
  \ next to the well and studied Bewg's instructions. The clues were stupendously\
  \ complicated, written in a kind of ur-Finnish, replete with puns, acrostics, and\
  \ lipograms and accompanied by diagrams, charts, illustrations, and emblems, often\
  \ minuscule an all executed with Bewg's ferocious cross-hatching, for which he used\
  \ an especially scratchy nib.\nDuring those three days and nights a-train, Lars\
  \ Talc had pored over the first stage of the trail. Marseilles was obvious, once\
  \ you had gained some insight into the workings of Bewg's brain. But Talc was in\
  \ northern Italy before he had worked out where to go next. At last he had realised\
  \ that that little grid of chocolate-coloured letters, hemmed in by inky curlicues,\
  \ directed him to this islet, so tiny it was found in only the rarest of atlases.\
  \ The train was in the outskirts of Marseilles before Talc, his cranium fuming,\
  \ worked out that Bewg was leading him to a well upon the islet, at the bottom of\
  \ which he would find a packet, the packet itself containing further clues without\
  \ which the remainder of the trail would be forever unintelligible, the prize forever\
  \ out of his grasp.\nThe bucket was resting at the bottom of the well. He raised\
  \ it, with much clanking. The chain was rusty. The bucket came to the top, brimming\
  \ with water. On the underside of the bucket, Bewg, or one of his henchmen, had\
  \ taped a waterproof packet, emblazoned with a picture of a churn. Talc tore it\
  \ from the bucket and, without pausing to open it, hurried to the boat and motored\
  \ back to Marseilles at top speed, accidentally killing a stray moorhen in the process.\n\
  When he opened the packet, as he guzzled a flagon of grog in the bar of the French\
  \ seaport's most elegant dancehall, he found Bewg's clue to be uncharacteristically\
  \ simple.\n\u201CGo to the Foreigners\u2019 Toilet,\u201D it read, \u201CIn the\
  \ cistern you will find a packet containing the next clue.\u201D\nAch! You wretch,\
  \ Bewg, you cullion! Lars Talc lost a day recovering the second packet, and felt\
  \ duty bound to leave a bauble in the donation box. By the time he was back in Finland,\
  \ it was Wednesday evening, and he was exhausted, and according to a sinful little\
  \ footnote he had just managed to decipher, he had only two and a half days, until\
  \ noon on the following Saturday, to track down his prize.\n[2017-10-12]"
