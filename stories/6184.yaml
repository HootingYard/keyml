text: "A Brechtian sea-shanty, once sung in music halls:\nThere's a blighter eating\
  \ bloaters. He won't have no mayonnaise. He hates Continental sauces and Continental\
  \ ways. He never wears a beret, nor strings onions round his neck. He's a bloater-eating\
  \ blighter dancing a hornpipe on the deck. For he's a sailing blighter on the good\
  \ ship Marmaduke. He eats so many bloaters that soon he starts to puke. He vomits\
  \ on the orlop deck and again upon the poop. The other sailors pick him up and chuck\
  \ him in the soup. By soup of course I mean the sea, the churning broiling sea.\
  \ And the blighter eating bloaters, well in truth that man was me. I puked some\
  \ more and then I swam until I reached the shore. It was a Continental shore o lumme\
  \ guv, o lor\u2019. Now I must eat mayonnaise and Continental sauces. But now at\
  \ last I'm mindful of globalising forces. So give me sauce and condiments to accompany\
  \ my bloaters, and I will explain all about socioeconomic motors, the engines of\
  \ commerce and exchange and of all sorts of trades. Give me my breakfast bloaters\
  \ and don't stint on mayonnaise!\n[2011-03-10]"
