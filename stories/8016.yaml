text: 'On the tenth day of Christmas Old Halob gave to me

  Ten rusty nozzles,

  Nine paper sickbags,

  Eight tufts of bindweed,,

  Seven mordant herons,

  Six hideous bat gods,

  Ecto-oplasm!

  Four dead chaffinches,

  Three poptarts,

  Two cardboard pigs,

  And a viper, a shrew and a bee.
