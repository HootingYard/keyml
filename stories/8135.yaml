text: "A letter plops on to my desk from Tim Belp.\nDear Mr Key, I noticed, in yesterday's\
  \ essay on tin foil, that you ascribed authorship of the play The Man Who Came To\
  \ Dinner In A Shiny Pointy Hat to a certain Belper Frisson. Well, the name means\
  \ nothing to me, because I am just a simple country person and a stranger to the\
  \ sophisticated delights of theatreland. But I can tell you that in my neck of the\
  \ woods\u2014that is, Belper\u2014what we call a \u201CBelper frisson\u201D is that\
  \ little pang of excitement one gets when, having left our lovely Derbyshire town\
  \ to go elsewhere on an errand, one arrives back, on the train, and steps on to\
  \ the platform of Belper railway station, home at last. If you have never been to\
  \ Belper, may I recommend a visit? Not being a native, you will be unlikely to feel\
  \ a \u201CBelper frisson\u201D upon arrival, but you may nevertheless experience\
  \ a thrill when you learn that you are in the birthplace of swarfega, manufactured\
  \ by Deb Ltd in Belper since its invention by Audley Bowdler Williamson in 1947.\
  \ Passionately yours, Tim Belp.\n[2012-01-16]"
