text: "It is a simple enough matter to embed a galvanic battery in the graceful head\
  \ of a swan, provided, that is, you are a boffin with some training in the basic\
  \ techniques of veterinary surgery. The layperson or amateur is likely to face difficulties\
  \ not only with the bloody business of embedding, but also in telling the difference\
  \ between a galvanic battery and other types of battery, and indeed in knowing what\
  \ a swan looks like. The ornithological ignorance of some people is breathtaking,\
  \ and that includes boffins. For example, I once met a boffin, an acknowledged wizard\
  \ at home in the lab heating various substances in glass tubes over a Bunsen burner,\
  \ who mistook a heron for a cassowary, if you can imagine such bird-blindness. And\
  \ do not get me started on the story of the boffin who pointed at a flock of swooping\
  \ swifts in the sky and said \u201CAh, I love the sight of swooping pratincoles!\u201D\
  \nA boffin who has grasped the basics of veterinary surgery, however, should know\
  \ a swan when they see one and, depending on their field of boffinhood, ought to\
  \ be able to pick a galvanic battery out of a line-up of various types of battery.\
  \ There are cases where the name of the battery-type is etched or stamped on the\
  \ body of the battery itself, for ease of identification, and then no familiarity\
  \ with batteries is required. However, it is rare, o rare indeed!, to find a bird\
  \ so etched or stamped. One must learn at least a few basic identification skills,\
  \ to pick a swan out of a line-up.\nBut I ought not give the impression that the\
  \ putative embedder must first pick out a galvanic battery, and then select a swan,\
  \ from a pair of line-ups like identity parades such as are arranged by coppers\
  \ following an arrest connected to a heist. It is much more common to be called\
  \ in to perform the embedding and to find a galvanic battery and a swan already\
  \ provided, the one resting on a countertop and the other, stunned with anaesthetic,\
  \ fast asleep in a basket. Even the most stupid person will know which is the battery\
  \ and which is the bird, I hope, and to allay even the merest smidgen of doubt,\
  \ some form of signage can be installed, cheaply, using a couple of sheets of cardboard\
  \ and a magic marker pen. To make absolutely sure, the words \u201CGalvanic Battery\u201D\
  \ and \u201CSwan\u201D on the signs can be accompanied by simple pictograms for\
  \ the illiterate. Add to each sign an emboldened arrow pointing clearly towards\
  \ what a beardy French intellectual would call \u201Cthe referent\u201D, and Bob's\
  \ your uncle.\nNow, I mentioned that the embedding is a bloody business, and so\
  \ it is. There is no way of slicing an opening in the graceful head of the swan\
  \ without causing a flow of hot red swan-gore. It is helpful to have a gaggle of\
  \ eager unpaid interns to staunch this, and to mop up inevitable spillages, so the\
  \ embedder can get on with the task at hand, which is to embed the galvanic battery\
  \ into the swan's head by shoving it, o so delicately!, through the bloody slit\
  \ until it is lodged firmly next to the swan's brain. Note that the brain of a swan\
  \ will always be located in its head, rather than elsewhere in its anatomy. That\
  \ done, sew up the slit with butchers\u2019 string, and slap a bandage over it.\
  \ If the bandage is white, as is common, and the swan is white, as is common, the\
  \ casual observer may not even notice that the embedding has taken place. That may\
  \ or may not be important, depending upon the legal regulations obtaining in the\
  \ jurisdiction. Some authorities take a dim view of the embedding of galvanic batteries\
  \ in the graceful heads of swans, though for the life of me I cannot think why that\
  \ might be so. In any case, it is better to check the legal position beforehand.\n\
  Alert readers will have spotted that I omitted to mention perhaps the most crucial\
  \ part of the process, which is the bit where the galvanic battery is actually attached\
  \ to the brain of the swan by wires. In practice, of course, one would never miss\
  \ this out, otherwise the entire operation would be a waste of time and effort.\
  \ However, unlike the slicing and cutting and shoving and staunching and mopping\
  \ up, the wiring is a fiddly and complicated matter fraught with godawful difficulties,\
  \ and deserves a separate article, written in fiddly and complicated prose, to which\
  \ the reader must pay unflinching attention, while also being wide awake, and probably\
  \ half-crazed with stimulants. That article has yet to be written, and it will need\
  \ to be approved by experts in the fields of galvanic batteries, and of swans, and\
  \ of wiring, before it can appear here, for your instruction and edification.\n\
