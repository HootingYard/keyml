text: "A week or two after the inaugural parade for the Hooting Yard website, as long\
  \ ago as December 2003, I received a plea in the post from a concerned reader. Dear\
  \ Frank, my anonymous correspondent wrote, I have heard it said that Blodgett always\
  \ maintained an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag. Is this true, and if so,\
  \ can you give an example, drawn from a typical Blodgett day?\nI have not ignored\
  \ this question, but coming up with an answer has taken a lot of research, sometimes\
  \ perilous. If you have undertaken perilous research, on any topic, you will know\
  \ how it can make you a bit wobbly on your pins. Anyway, I did finally manage to\
  \ find out what Blodgett kept in his rucksack on a typical day, and now that I am\
  \ less wobbly on my pins, I can at last respond to that long-ago question.\nYes,\
  \ Blodgett did always maintain an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag. The twenty-sixth\
  \ of March 1965 was, for Blodgett, a pretty unremarkable day\u2014neither muckling\
  \ nor mickling, as Fisher would say. Here is a comprehensive list of the contents\
  \ of his duffel bag on that day:\nAniseed. Bl\xF6tzmann diagrams. Cake. Dust. Ectoplasm.\
  \ Flippers. Grease. Hinges. Incunabula. Jam doughnuts. Kaolin. Linctus. Marmalade.\
  \ Nothingness. Orpiment. Prunes. Queen Esmerelda's Toilet Water. Ransom money. Sandpaper.\
  \ Turps. Ullage. Vinegar. Wax. X-Ray Spectacles. Yeast. Zinc blobs.\n[2007-03-04]"
