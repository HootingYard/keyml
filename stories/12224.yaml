  \ compiling a reliable list of the works of Dobson. Once a year, at around this\
  \ time, he updates the list to include those pamphlets to which reference has been\
  \ made in these pages during the previous twelvemonth. And bang on time, here he\
  \ is with an additional eight titles. Each has appended to it one of those damnably\
  \ clever Bl\xF6tzmann numbers. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, these\
  \ titles are out of print.\nYou can find links to earlier lists here.\n161. Are\
  \ There Any Moles In Outer Space? No, There Are Not!\n162. On Not Toppling Into\
  \ Any Of The Many Canals Of Amsterdam\n163. How I Hid Under A Table During A Thunderstorm\
  \ And Ruined My Trousers By Kneeling In A Puddle Of Unaerated Potato Juice, And\
  \ What This Tells Us About The Human Spirit In Extremis\n164. Several Observations\
  \ On Kathy Kirby, Composed In A Cipher So Baffling That Centuries May Pass Before\
  \ Anybody Will Be Able To Wring Any Sense From It\n165. A Tally Of All The Breakfasts\
