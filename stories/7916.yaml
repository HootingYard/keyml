text: "Today's Hooting Yard Advent Calendar picture is of a homunculus, specifically\
  \ the mandrake-root homunculus.\n\nThere is a legend that when the mandrake-person\
  \ is pulled from the ground, it shrieks in pain, and this cry is able to madden,\
  \ deafen or even kill an unprotected human being. One way of pulling a mandrake\
  \ out of the ground safely is given as follows: \u201CA furrow must be dug around\
  \ the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which\
  \ the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavours to follow him,\
  \ and so easily pulls up the root, but dies suddenly instead of his master. After\
  \ this the root can be handled without fear.\u201D\n[2011-12-22]"
