  \ four days late. Just bear in mind that my health is pitiful and I have the eyesight\
  \ of a mole, and bear with me. What we are going to do is to jump-start the calendar\
  \ with four postages today, and you can pretend they have appeared with rigorous\
  \ regularity since the beginning of the month. I shall endeavour to post the rest\
  \ of them daily until Christmas or, as John and Yoko would have it, until war is\
  \ over.\nAll these birds come from the collection of Andy Martin, tyrannical leader\
  \ of UNIT, to whom many many thanks.\n\n[2016-12-04]"
