  This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I present a caption competition with a twist.
  Those of you who can barely think straight due to your excitement at the continuing
  wonders of the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar will be pleased to learn that, having
  printed and cut out and pasted with glue to a sheet of cardboard one of the pictures
  which appeared earlier in the week, you will have an advantage over common or garden
  Dabbler readers. You will already be familiar with the photograph, and indeed with
  the caption. So get thee hence and devise your entry for a chance to win untold
  riches in gold.
