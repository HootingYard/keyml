text: "\nIn her distant youth, the balletomane Nan Kew was a flapper. Not yet smitten\
  \ by the ballet, she liked to flap about in speakeasies, getting dizzy on illicit\
  \ cocktails and executing the latest dance crazes to the sound of boogie woogie\
  \ and similar musical woogies, as performed by hot jazz quintets led by rascals.\n\
  It was in one speakeasy, on 43,722nd Street, that Nan Kew encountered the lumbering\
  \ walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer Babinsky. In those days, of course,\
  \ the phrase \u201Cserial killer\u201D had not yet been coined, so Babinsky's modus\
  \ operandi remained sub rosa, and he did not have coppers on his trail.\nThe Helsingfors\
  \ poliisi may not have had their eyes on Babinsky that night but somebody else did.\
  \ Lurking in the speakeasy subfusc was the serial killer's long-lost idiot half-brother,\
  \ Babinsky 2. He was watching Babinsky's every move\u2014and what moves! Babinsky\
  \ was out on the dancefloor, essaying some new dance steps of his own invention,\
  \ which he called \u201Cthe lumbering psychopath\u201D. Those of you familiar with\
  \ the dances of the era will recall it from its abbreviated name, the lumberpsych,\
  \ which became wildly popular and spawned such hot jazz standards as Papa Done Gone\
  \ Lopped Off My Limbs Again and Polka Dots, Hair Oil, And Brutality.\nNow it so\
  \ happened that at this time, Babinsky 2 was Nan Kew's paramour. They seemed an\
  \ ill-matched couple, the flapper and the idiot, but there was a definite, if inexplicable,\
  \ chemistry between them. Thus it was that Nan Kew, dizzy on illicit cocktails and\
  \ slumped somewhat lopsidedly against Babinsky 2 in their booth in the speakeasy\
  \ gloom, knew without asking why her darling was transfixed by the lumbering brute\
  \ on the dancefloor. Babinsky 2 longed for a reconciliation with his long-lost brother,\
  \ from whom he had been parted ever since that catastrophic picnic on the edge of\
  \ the forest at the end of the war. Or had it been at the beginning of the war?\
  \ So fuddled was his brain that Babinsky 2 could no longer remember. All he knew\
  \ was that he had a burning desire to climb trees and play pin-the-antennae-on-the-locust\
  \ again with his brother, to relive their carefree childhood in the shadow of the\
  \ Big Formidable Mountains.\nBut idiot that he was, even Babinsky 2 knew that his\
  \ half-brother, being a psychopath, wanted nothing more than to drive an axe into\
  \ his, Babinsky 2's, skull, and then chop off his head and boil it in one of his\
  \ horrible grease-encrusted vats in his horrible grease-encrusted cellar beneath\
  \ his horrible grease-encrusted chalet. And so all he could do was sit in the darkened\
  \ booth, gazing at Babinsky with love and longing and terror.\nThen dizzy Nan Kew\
  \ had an idea.\n\u201CI am sure he won't recognise you if you don a disguise,\u201D\
  \ she slurred in her woozy way, \u201CWe could get you up as a Levantine toothbrush\
  \ salesman, or a crippled Dutch ski-lift operative, and Babinsky will never guess\
  \ your true identity. Then, if we persuade him there is a cuddly little hamster\
  \ or guinea pig trapped at the top of that sycamore tree in the street outside the\
  \ speakeasy, the two of you can climb it together, just as if you were carefree\
  \ tots before that picnic. Meanwhile, I will gather pencil and paper and a pin and\
  \ a blindfold, and when you come back in you can play that foolish game you were\
  \ both so fond of.\u201D\n\u201CWhat a fantastic idea!\u201D shouted Babinsky 2,\
  \ planting a kiss on Nan Kew's flushed cheek.\n\u201CYou will just have to convince\
  \ your half-brother that the hamster or guinea pig atop the tree is an invisible\
  \ one,\u201D added the flapper, \u201CBut that should not prove difficult. Just\
  \ tell him there has been a plague of invisible small cuddly mammals in Helsingfors\
  \ and you will show him the press clippings tomorrow. That will give me more than\
  \ enough time to make some counterfeits on a Gestetner machine.\u201D\nDizzy as\
  \ she was, Nan Kew was already displaying the resourcefulness which later stood\
  \ her in such good stead as a balletomane. (See her Memoirs for detailed clarification.)\n\
  That night, everything went according to plan. The flapper and the idiot managed\
  \ to pull the wool over Babinsky's eyes. The next day, however, it all went wrong.\
  \ The Gestetner machine was jammed. Mice nibbled at Babinsky 2's disguise. There\
  \ was a teeming downpour and thick fog. War broke out following skirmishes on the\
  \ border at daybreak.\nWhen they went to meet Babinsky at midday on Sawdust Bridge\
  \ as arranged, the serial killer was armed with his axe and his hatchet and his\
  \ slicer and god knows what other fearsome sharp implements. Above his walrus moustache,\
  \ his eyes burned with psychopathic psychopathology. Babinsky 2 and Nan Kew turned\
  \ tail and fled through the narrow Helsingfors streets.\nIt would be forty years\
  \ before the half-brothers met again. During all that time, Babinsky 2 treasured\
  \ his memories of that one evening. For a cherished hour, Babinsky and Babinsky\
  \ 2 had relived the idyll of their pre-picnic childhood, all thanks to the quick\
  \ wits of future balletomane Nan Kew!\nThis article first appeared in The Weekly\
