text: "Dobson went through a strange phase where he was consumed by a mania to have\
  \ an article published in the Reader's Digest. This obsession\u2014mercifully temporary\u2014\
  is thought to have been occasioned by water on the brain, following an incident\
  \ when the pamphleteer toppled off Sawdust Bridge and was submerged in the icy river\
  \ for over six minutes. His toppling may have been due to the fact that he was,\
  \ at the time, breaking in a secondhand pair of Tunisian Air Cadet boots, and was\
  \ unsteady on his feet. Hoisted by a crane from the madly gushing water some miles\
  \ downstream, Dobson was taken to a riverside crane-person's hut and plonked in\
  \ front of a radiator to dry off. There was a shelf stacked with untold copies of\
  \ the Reader's Digest in the hut, and the pamphleteer browsed through them as he\
  \ sat engulfed in steam.\nLater, back at home, Dobson set himself to write a piece\
  \ typical of the magazine's content. He was in such a flap that he dashed off not\
  \ one, but four articles, each entitled I Am John's Head. These are not versions\
  \ or rewritings of a single essay, but four discrete pieces of prose, and they could\
  \ not be more different from one another.\nIn one, John is a Jesuit priest, and\
  \ his head is the size and shape of a potato. He lives in Shoeburyness, and is wrestling\
  \ with doubts about his faith, which make his head throb. In the second piece, the\
  \ head is no longer attached to the body of John\u2014a different John in this case\u2014\
  but floating free, much like a hot air balloon, and subject to the same hazards\
  \ and imperilments as a balloon, except of course that a head has a much tougher\
  \ hide. The third piece treats John as a host upon which the head feeds as a parasite.\
  \ By general assent, this is the most unnerving of the four essays, and there have\
  \ been attempts to suppress it. In number four, John and his head barely rate a\
  \ mention, as Dobson seems to get carried away with a prolonged and rancorous piece\
  \ of invective about the ill-fitting Tunisian Air Cadet boots which caused his Sawdust\
  \ Bridge mishap.\nDobson seems to have got something out of his system by writing\
  \ what scholars now call \u201CThe Four I Am John's Head Essays\u201D. He never\
  \ submitted any of them for publication in the Reader's Digest, shoving them into\
  \ an old cardboard box and forgetting about them. In an interview late in life,\
  \ he was asked about the essays, and asked also why he had not written one called\
  \ I Am Jane's Head. Unfortunately, the questions were put to the pamphleteer during\
  \ the notorious Pointy Town Pavilion interview, in which no sensible, or even half\
  \ way sane, replies were given, the interviewer's legs were broken, the pavilion\
  \ burned to the ground, and a blithely oblivious Dobson sat there drooling into\
  \ a tin cup and babbling on about President Nixon's fondness for mashing potatoes\
  \ as a relaxation technique*, one he was minded to ape. We have no evidence that\
  \ he ever did so.\nThe I Am John's Head essays are due to be published for the first\
  \ time in a single volume, with notes and commentary by upstart young Dobsonist\
  \ Ted Cack, when he is released from a Swiss prison.\n* NOTE\_: This is true, of\
  \ course, but I cannot recall where I read it, and would be grateful to any reader\
  \ who can direct me to further information.\nUPDATE\_: Here is a reference to the\
  \ source of my Nixon / mashed potato information. I will try to find the exact quotation\
  \ during the coming days.\n[2009-08-06]"
