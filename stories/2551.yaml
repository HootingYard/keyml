text: "Rediscovered Urban Rituals, who helped to organise a May Day Jack in the Green\
  \ procession in Deptford in 2006, recreated the famous Charlton Horn Fair procession\
  \ today.\nThe Abbot of Bermondsey granted a charter in 1268 for an annual fair to\
  \ be held at Charlton, which was eventually banned in 1872 for \u2018licentious\
  \ conduct\u2019. The celebrants dressed up in drag and adorned themselves with horns\
  \ and masks, presumably evoking ancient ritual & fertility symbolism. The procession\
  \ of \u2018Hornified Fumblers\u2019 traditionally met at Cuckold's Point in Rotherhithe,\
  \ after crossing the Thames from the City. They paraded through Deptford and Greenwich\
  \ and on to the Fair.\nWhat better way for Mr Key to spend his Sunday morning than\
  \ to trail in the procession's wake, albeit dressed in mufti?\n\n\nSnapper\_: Pansy\

  \ available in the fullness of time.\n[2009-06-28]"
