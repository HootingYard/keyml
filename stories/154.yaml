text: "The front page of the online Guardian was recently redesigned, and there is\
  \ a piece in today's paper about readers\u2019 reactions. Some people like the new\
  \ look, some don't. \u201CEmily Bell [online editor\u2026 sorry, \u2018director\
  \ of digital content\u2019] has made it clear that there is no going back,\u201D\
  \ apparently, but the disgruntled among the readership can rest assured\u2014\u201C\
  she is listening to the feedback from users. Comments posted to her blog are being\
  \ reviewed and sorted into \u2018silos of concern\u2019 to be considered by editors,\
  \ web developers and designers.\u201D\nI think what is meant here is that she has\
  \ sorted out the comments, putting like with like. There are comments about fonts,\
  \ ease of navigation, arrangement of menus, and so on. What I want to know is why\
  \ a simple \u2018category\u2019 becomes a \u2018silo of concern\u2019? Do they think\
  \ this sounds clever? Does it make the job of the unpaid work experience trainee\
  \ doing the sorting out more exciting? \u201CPashmina, I want you to go through\
  \ all the comments we've received and place each one in its SILO OF CONCERN!\u201D\
  \ I expect there is a Hub around which all the Silos are arranged, and each Silo\
  \ will be dealt with in a series of Tranches.\nJohn Birt made a career out of this\
  \ kind of gobbledegook in his days at the BBC, where an \u2018arrow\u2019 became\
  \ a \u2018directional pointing device\u2019, for example. Why does no one ever take\
  \ these people aside and gently point out to them that they are embarrassing themselves?\
  \ Straightforward pomposity I could understand, but it's more like the bureaucratic\
  \ equivalent of teenage poetry, where the (mis)use of \u2018big words\u2019 is a\
  \ hapless attempt to confer profundity.\nAccording to the OED, which even the witless\
  \ twelve-year-olds at the Guardian must have heard of, there are four distinct meanings\
  \ of silo.\nSmooching With Istvan, the second Malice Aforethought Press anthology\
  \ of writings and drawings by Mr Key and Max D\xE9charn\xE9. Well do I remember\
  \ creating the covers by spraying sheets of card with seven or eight different colours\
  \ of car spray paint in a closed room. I should have opened the windows. Incidentally,\
  \ it is within the pages of Smooching With Istvan that the words \u201CHooting Yard\u201D\
  \ appeared in print for the very first time. I will shortly be auctioning an exceedingly\
  \ rare copy of this one hundred page collection of bran tub scrapings on eBay, but\
  \ before doing so I will accept bids here, until noon on Saturday 19th May. A full\
  \ eBay-style description of the book is added in the Comments. Taking advice from\
  \ the kinds of people who advise me on such things, the starting price is \xA3100.\n\
