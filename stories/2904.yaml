text: "Here are some of the topics I have considered writing about today, in no particular\
  \ order\u2026\nThe interior workings of the brain of a moose.\nThe delivery of a\
  \ brand new Snodgrass-Ponsonby Machine, to replace one sent for repair.\nTwo Mossad\
  \ agents playing pingpong in a dismal hangar.\nNelson Eddy, by a waterfall, calling\
  \ \u201Cyou-oo-oo-oo\u201D, to Jeanette Macdonald, because he has sprained his ankle\
  \ and wants her to call an air ambulance.\nA map of Vange, with all its unmarked\
  \ pathways marked.\nA discursive yet exhaustive history of the unbutton.\n\u2026\
  \ but each of these subjects has been done to death by Dobson, in a series of pamphlets.\
  \ It is true that the pamphlets are out of print, but it's old ground, old ground.\
  \ I think I shall instead turn my hand to a mashed potato waltz, and whistle down\
  \ the wind.\n[2009-08-20]"
