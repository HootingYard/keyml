text: "That pot or vase I think.\nI heard these words, given as the answer to a question,\
  \ but I did not hear the question due to the tremendous racket of a German improvising\
  \ oompah marching band which appeared from around the corner just as the question\
  \ was posed. At least, I assume a question was put and drowned out by the din. Otherwise\
  \ \u201Cthat pot or vase I think\u201D makes little or no sense.\nIn any case, I\
  \ looked wildly around to see what pot or vase was being spoken of. Granted, it\
  \ was none of my business, I had merely eavesdropped upon somebody else's conversation,\
  \ but my interest is always piqued by pottery. Well, not always. Sometimes I yawn\
  \ in the presence of ceramics, a yawn so wide and prolonged that I begin to drool.\
  \ Fortunately I always carry an embroidered napkin with which to mop any unseemly\
  \ dribbling from my chin.\nThe embroidery on my napkins\u2014that's right, napkins\
  \ plural, for I have quite a collection\u2014was stitched by a crone in a godawful\
  \ hamlet hidden somewhere in the Blue Forgotten Hills. I cannot recall the circumstances\
  \ in which I stumbled upon her noisome hut, other than that I was on an organised\
  \ walking tour at the time. The tour was arranged by an agency specialising in walking\
  \ tours of hilly areas, places with lots of humps and bumps to be negotiated.\n\
  This agency had its head office situated, inappropriately, on a very flat and level\
  \ high street in a market town. Immediately in front of its doorway, no more than\
  \ two or three paces as accomplished by average human adult leg-length, was a cement\
  \ horse trough. When I visited the agency, a horse was gobbling water from the trough.\
  \ It was a startlingly elegant horse. I patted its fetlocks, or what I supposed\
  \ were its fetlocks, though I ought to confess that my knowledge of equine anatomy\
  \ is skimpy. I paid little attention when we were taught this topic by Dr Gabbitas\
  \ in the village schoolroom all those years ago.\nDr Gabbitas claimed to be an expert\
  \ on the subject of horses, as well as astronomy, Latin, pig Latin, pudding recipes,\
  \ the higher mathematics, polar geography, the flight patterns of uncommon birds,\
  \ shove-ha'penny, dust, and many another topic. He was a curiously bloated figure,\
  \ who looked as if he had been dragged from the sea after drowning several months\
  \ ago. But the village where I grew up was nowhere near the sea. I did not see it\
  \ until I was the age of Christ at his crucifixon.\nI was stunned. There I stood,\
  \ on my thirty-third birthday, upon the beach at Imber, gazing at that vast wet\
  \ sloshing expanse. It would be no exaggeration to say that the sight of it befuddled\
  \ my brain, so much so that I quickly retreated to the dilapidated seaside boarding-house\
  \ where I had taken a room, and I shut myself in that room, and remained there for\
  \ weeks.\nThere was, on the windowsill of that room, a pot or vase I think, holding\
  \ a splurge of lupins, freshly cut when I arrived, and slowly shrivelling and dying,\
  \ as the days passed, as all of us do, as the years pass.\n[2017-01-23]"
