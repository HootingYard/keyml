text: "I was much taken with the title of a recent postage at the excellent Ptak Science\
  \ Books blog, to wit Visionaries, Ice People, And The Marriage Of Stupid And Brutal.\
  \ Indeed, fomenting within my pea-sized yet pulsating brain is a piece to which\
  \ I can apply this title, a piece which will bear no actual relation to John Ptak's\
  \ post, though that is well worth your attention. Now, on Channel Four News, I have\
  \ just heard an arresting reference to \u201Ca visionary cobbler\u201D.\nClearly\
  \ the ethereal spirits which reign within my brainpans are gently prodding me to\
  \ turn my attention to visionaries. Watch this space.\n[2009-09-21]"
