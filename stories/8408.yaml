text: "Let us consider the birds of the air, with their feathers and their wingspans\
  \ and their tiny little heads. It is an arresting thought that many of the birds\
  \ we know today are descended from the fierce and rapacious pterodactyl of prehistory.\
  \ Though we should not forget that many modern birds are themselves fierce and rapacious.\
  \ We need only think of the swan, for example, or dozens of different types of gull.\n\
  You can test the fierceness and rapaciousness of a seagull by placing a paper bag\
  \ full of breadcrumbs on the wall abutting the promenade at a seaside resort. Stand\
  \ well back, and wait. Sooner rather than later, a seagull, or seagulls, will swoop\
  \ upon the paper bag and frenziedly slash it to ribbons to gain access to the breadcrumbs\
  \ within, which it will gobble up so greedily that many of the crumbs will be scattered\
  \ upon the paving. Further birds\u2014other gulls, or pigeons\u2014will then descend\
  \ upon the leavings, and within seconds not a trace of breadcrumb will remain, and\
  \ the shreds of paper bag will be blown away on the winds.\nThis is an example of\
  \ the sort of violence Tennyson must have had in mind when he wrote of \u201CNature,\
  \ red in tooth and claw\u201D in In Memoriam A. H. H. (1849), even though no blood\
  \ has actually been spilled. The seagull is a scavenger rather than a bird of prey,\
  \ the chancer of the avian world. But what I wish to advert to here is, let us say,\
  \ attitude. A seagull may not slash at and tear to shreds something quick and alive,\
  \ say for an example a vole or a hamster or, indeed, you, standing there at the\
  \ seaside, but that is a mere accident of evolution. It is certainly imbued with\
  \ all the fierceness and rapacity of its prehistoric ancestor. Ask the paper bag.\n\
  Of course there are other birds, befeathered and bewinged and with tiny little heads,\
  \ which are more docile. One thinks of budgerigars. One does not think for too long\
  \ of budgerigars, because quite frankly their charms pall rather quickly, unless\
  \ one has a particular \u201Cthing\u201D for them. It was long thought that the\
  \ budgerigar's natural habitat was a cage plopped on a sideboard in an ornate parlour\
  \ or drawing-room crowded with knicknacks and gewgaws, lit by gas, which perhaps\
  \ tells you most of what you need to know about them. Their heads are particularly\
  \ tiny, in relation to their bodies.\nThe tininess of birds\u2019 heads in general\
  \ means that there is not much room inside them for the brain, which in itself is\
  \ therefore a tiny thing. We might wonder at how much, or how little, cognitive\
  \ ability resides in the average brain of the average bird. Not much at all, we\
  \ will conclude. As a life form, birds are pretty thick. Yet their lack of intelligence\
  \ has not prevented them being masters of the air, nest-builders, hunters and scavengers\
  \ and even\u2014in the case of Newfoundland crows\u2014skilful exploiters of the\
  \ possible uses of twigs. We should not be tempted to discount the powers of birds\
  \ simply because most of them are stupid.\nThe thing most types of birds can do\
  \ that we cannot is, of course, to fly. That is where their wings are so decisive\
  \ as appendages. Mankind has had to fashion wings out of balsa wood and straw and\
  \ string, and still he cannot fly. I think this may be to do with the fact that\
  \ we cannot flap our arms with sufficient rapidity. An interesting question to ask\
  \ is if you would accept a putative Faustian bargain, that you would be granted\
  \ the ability to fly in return for having your brain shrunk to the size of a budgerigar's,\
  \ with the commensurate diminution in mental capacity. To give your reply to that\
  \ question some import, we would have to predicate that the process be irreversible.\
  \ I think all of us would cry out an impassioned \u201CYes!\u201D if we thought\
  \ we could fly about for a couple of days, stupid as a bird, and then resume our\
  \ normal flightless daily lives with reswollen brains and our wits intact.\nLet\
  \ us further assume that we could choose not just to be granted the gift of flight\
  \ but actually to become a bird. Which bird would you pick? Most of us, I think,\
  \ would avoid the fate of becoming a budgerigar, or indeed an ostrich. Not only\
  \ is the ostrich particularly moronic, but it cannot fly. I suppose a very stupid\
  \ person, who did not know these things about ostriches, might accept the Faustian\
  \ bargain and then choose to be transformed into an ostrich, with the net result\
  \ of simply being turned into a life form even more stupid than he started out as,\
  \ without the compensation of being able to fly.\nIt occurs to me that there may\
  \ be a profitable opera or stage musical to be made from that notion. It would of\
  \ course be a tragedy. The part of the protagonist would have to be written with\
  \ exceeding care, for there is a risk that an audience would be resistant to identifying\
  \ closely with such an irredeemably thick hero. So perhaps a comedy would be more\
  \ appropriate. One can readily imagine packed theatres loud with laughter at the\
  \ antics of Ostrich Man. It would be cruel laughter.\nBirds, too can be cruel, but\
  \ they do not laugh. At least I am unaware of any birds that laugh, as opposed to\
  \ birds whose song can be interpreted as chuckling or guffawing. But such interpretations\
  \ are mere anthropomorphism, a besetting sin. Can birds commit sin? I am sure this\
  \ is a question theologians must have asked, over the centuries, but I am not familiar\
  \ with their arguments. I would assume that the answer must be \u201CNo, birds are\
  \ incapable of sin\u201D, for the simple reason that they are so damned stupid.\n\
  Another thing birds can do that we cannot is to lay eggs, but that is a topic so\
  \ plump with possibilities that it deserves an essay of its own.\n[2012-02-18]"
