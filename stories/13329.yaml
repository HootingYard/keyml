text: "Sometimes I find myself fretting about things which common sense tells me are\
  \ absolutely not worth fretting about. Yet still I fret. Think of it as idiotic\
  \ fretting.\nThe latest matter to consume my stupid attention is as follows. I was\
  \ struck, when watching Danish television dramas such as Borgen and The Killing,\
  \ by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever\
  \ saying \u201CTakk\u201D (\u201CThank you\u201D), certainly more so than the average\
  \ Brit or American would do. I am not familiar with real life in Denmark, but I\
  \ assume that the writers of these series are making every effort to reproduce the\
  \ actual speech of contemporary Danes.\nIn Game Of Thrones, by contrast, we are\
  \ told by Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) that \u201Cthere is no word for \u2018thank\
  \ you\u2019 in Dothraki\u201D. Given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric\
  \ race whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse-heart, raw, the absence\
  \ of an expression of gratitude is not surprising.\nBut what is bothering me is\
  \ this\_: when Danish dramas are shown on Dothraki television, how in heaven's name\
  \ will the subtitle-writers cope with all those \u201CTakk\u201Ds?\nIt is, to be\
  \ sure, a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.\n\nThe Khaleesi eating a raw horse-heart\
