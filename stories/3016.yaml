text: "Their first album pretty much defined the style we know as \u201Cbathtub reggae\u201D\
  , the follow up sounded like a swarm of hornets trapped in a funeral parlour, and\
  \ now top beat combo Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here\
  \ / Buckle! are storming the charts again with their new release. It's a box set\
  \ of cover versions of the seven Sibelius symphonies, recorded in what might best\
  \ be described as Ivesian pillow-talk progpunk doo-wop. Fatima Gilliblat talked\
  \ to the band outside a kiosk on a crumbling seaside pier.\nFatima\_: It's very\
  \ windy.\nBand\_: Yes. And have you noticed how the gulls seem tense, as if awaiting\
  \ orders from some sort of gull-god?\nFatima\_: I am holding tight to my choc ice,\
  \ for I fear it might be snatched by one of these rapacious scavenging birds.\n\
  Band\_: But that's the point\u2026 you see how they are just hovering, not swooping\
  \ down to the pier at all, despite that pile of discarded wafers and toffee apples\
  \ and seaside resort cocktail sausages in puff pastry?\nFatima\_: Yes, that is curious.\
  \ Perhaps they're not hungry.\nBand\_: [Hollow laughter.] Gulls are always hungry.\n\
  Fatima\_: Well, anyway, let's talk about this new album.\nBand\_: Wait! See, there\
  \ is broiling and tumult in the clouds over to the west.\nFatima\_: So there is.\n\
  Band\_: The gull-god is come! Put aside your choc ice, Ms Gilliblat, and clamber\
  \ on to this makeshift altar we have cobbled together from rotting pier-planks and\
  \ seaweed.\nFatima\_: OK, if you say so. But why?\nBand\_: Because we are going\
  \ to sacrifice you to the gull-god of course, and tape the\_ blood-curdling savagery,\
  \ and then pop back to the studio to incorporate the field recording into our next\
  \ album.\nFatima\_: How exciting to think that I shall give my life for the cause\
  \ of experimental sound art!\nBand\_: That's the spirit!\nUnfortunately, soon after\
  \ this interview, the band split due to \u201Cartistic differences\u201D. The latest\
  \ news is that they have called a truce and are getting it together in the country,\
  \ so we may yet hear Fatima Gilliblat's electronically-manipulated death throes.\n\
  UPDATE\_: Apparently, Fatima survived. She is in fact a descendant of mythical giant\
  \ crows, and tore the gull-god to pieces with the power of her corvine brain.\n\
