text: "With Osama Bin Laden dead, the position of figurehead for the global Al Qaeda\
  \ franchise is vacant. I would like to put myself forward to fill this important\
  \ role. It is true that I do not believe in Allah, have never handled a Kalashnikov,\
  \ and, indeed, have in the past scribbled a blasphemous cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed\
  \ (see here and below). No doubt these things will count against me in the initial\
  \ round of interviews, which I understand will be taking place in some remote mountain\
  \ fastness in the coming days. But I have every confidence that I will be able to\
  \ win over the wild-eyed nutters and gun-toting beardy persons with my unique vision\
  \ of the role. What Al Qaeda desperately needs, I will argue, is an injection of\
  \ woolly Church of England-style cardigan-wearing niceness. Instead of all that\
  \ chanting and suicide bombing and beheading, I see the waging of jihad as a matter\
  \ of cups of tea and arrowroot biscuits and seed cake, with a spot of choral evensong\
  \ and a sermon. And instead of all that shouty sermonising packed with threats against\
  \ Jews and infidels, the sermons under my dispensation will be abstruse and windy,\
  \ full of qualifying phrases and equivocation. This is the way forward, or backwards,\
  \ or even sideways, for all these directions are of course equally valid in the\
  \ eyes of Allah, who we should think of as a sort of benign uncle with an unruly\
  \ beard and fantastic hairy eyebrows, not unlike the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\
  \nBlasphemous portrayal of the \u201CProphet\u201D Mohammed\n[2011-05-05]"
