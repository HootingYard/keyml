text: "One of the more distressing verbal infelicities committed by young persons\
  \ nowadays is the strewing of their utterances with \u201Cinnit\u201D, as in \u201C\
  I was like oh my god innit\u201D. My chief objection is that it is almost always\
  \ ungrammatical. It used to be the case that \u201Cinnit\u201D was a truncation\
  \ of \u201Cisn't it?\u201D, but if you listen carefully to teen persons, their \u201C\
  innit\u201Ds can rarely be construed as such.\nThe changing fads and fashions of\
  \ teensprache are a mystery, at least to me, for I have not studied these matters\
  \ properly. But I think I have stumbled upon the reason why \u201Cinnit\u201D has\
  \ become so ubiquitous. Last night, I watched a snippet of BBC4's John Lennon Night,\
  \ an edition of Top Of The Pops 2 (recorded some years ago, I think) in which Yoko\
  \ Ono did little introductory pieces to camera for a selection of songs by her bespectacled\
  \ Liverpudlian husband. The programme began with Yoko saying:\n\u201CWe didn't think\
  \ [Give Peace A Chance] would be a big song, but it is, innit?\u201D\nYoko was,\
  \ of course, using \u201Cinnit\u201D in a grammatically correct manner, but I am\
  \ convinced that a generation of young persons heard this when it was originally\
  \ broadcast and, bowled over by the Beatle relict's verbal flourish, duly began\
  \ to imitate her on any and every occasion.\nI am thus forced to revise my view\
  \ of \u201Cinnit\u201D and will henceforth say a little prayer for world peace and\
  \ a wish for no possessions whenever I overhear it.\n[2010-07-10]"
