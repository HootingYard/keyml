text: "Reading P J O'Rourke's Holidays In Hell (1988), I learned that in Communist\
  \ Poland, during the mid-1980s, there was a postpunk band called Garaz w Leeds,\
  \ or, in English, Garage in Leeds. Had they actually hailed from Leeds, or indeed\
  \ from anywhere in the UK, this would have been a terrible, terrible name. But precisely\
  \ because they were languishing behind the Iron Curtain, playing their reportedly\
  \ very gloomy \u201CCold Wave\u201D music, I think this is one of the most fantastic\
  \ band names ever devised. Where are they now, I wonder?\nUPDATE\_: They're on YouTube!\n\
