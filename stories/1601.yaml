text: "The cherry-cheeked farmer's wife went to market, for to buy a cow. She already\
  \ had a goat and a hen and a lamb and a hog and a sow. She wanted a cow so she would\
  \ have a daily supply of milk, and she wanted some worms to provide her with a goodly\
  \ amount of silk. But the only worms for sale that day were those of the earth and\
  \ the tape, and the cow she paid good money for was not quite the usual shape. It\
  \ was a cow in the form of a bear and it stood on its hind legs, and rather than\
  \ providing her with milk it laid weird furry eggs. For the market to which the\
  \ farmer's wife went was a market exceeding odd, where all the beasts were blasphemous\
  \ offences against God. There were spiders with horns and three-legged crows and\
  \ giraffes from the gates of Hades, and owls spawned from mud and geese with ears\
  \ and basilisks to frighten the ladies. The gentlemen were terrified too by the\
  \ pig with ten million eyes, and the bloated sacs with razor wings which swooped\
  \ down from the skies. \u2018Twas market day in Scroonhoonpooge when the godly tremble\
  \ and pray, for the devil sells his monsters on Scroonhoonpooge Market Day.\n[2009-01-31]"
