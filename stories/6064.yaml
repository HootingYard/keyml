text: "A highlight of the Hooting Yard year is the annual jamboree jointly organised\
  \ by the Sawdust Bridge Community Pole-Vaulting Collective and the Pointy Town Avant-Colliery\
  \ Marching Band. Sebastian Coe may have described tickets for the 2012 Olympics\
  \ as \u201Cthe greatest tickets on earth\u201D, but clearly he has never seen a\
  \ jamboree ticket, a thing of unsurpassed beauty not just on earth, but on any other\
  \ planet or planetoid or flaming ball of gas in the known or unknown universe. Had\
  \ he done so, he would eat his hat, with knobs on. It may look like a mere slip\
  \ of thin beige cardboard with a few letters and numbers printed upon it in bold\
  \ black ink, but this year, as every year, the jamboree ticket was designed by the\
  \ noted ticketist Rex Tick, a man who knows more than Sebastian Coe could ever learn\
  \ about the design of tickets, had he but world enough and time. And he has not,\
  \ for all those naked wrestling bouts with William Hague in a basement gymnasium\
  \ at the Palace of Westminster have taken their toll, and now he is reduced to uttering\
  \ hyperbolic twaddle whene'er a broadcaster's microphone is thrust towards his gob.\n\
  The gob of noted ticketist Rex Tick, however, is taciturn. He is a taciturn fellow.\
  \ In fact, one wit dubbed Tick \u201Cthe taciturn ticketist\u201D on precisely that\
  \ account. The fruit of his taciturnity is the unparalleled beauty of his ticket\
  \ designs. Every year he comes up with something of such blinding glory that some\
  \ foppish aesthetes have been known to buy a ticket without any intention of attending\
  \ the annual jamboree, in that squelchy, squelchy mud-strewn field. No, the dandies\
  \ put their ticket in a frame and hang it on the wall of their boudoir or salon,\
  \ to impress their equally foppish pals with the exquisite delicacy of their sensibilities.\
  \ So I am told, at any rate, by Rex Tick's sister, the vamp Dot Tick, who has been\
  \ seen \u201Cstepping out\u201D with an art critic or two.\nBut the tickets are\
  \ not the only things of eye-popping splendour on show at the jamboree. When they\
  \ come vaulting into view from across Sawdust Bridge, the athletes of the Community\
  \ Pole-Vaulting Collective display, on their jerkins, insignia designed by the noted\
  \ heraldic emblemist Rex Blem. Consisting of three Bobnits rampant engrailed azure\
  \ on a field gules, with boisson gingembre lashant, sewn into place over their pounding\
  \ hearts, the emblem has thrice won the Top Pole-Vaulting Club Insignia Cup awarded\
  \ by the Academy Of Pole-Vaulting And Bird-Spotting And Shilly-Shallying (Sawdust\
  \ Bridge Branch). Rex Blem himself has never turned up to accept the cup, for he\
  \ is a recluse with a fear of cups. According to his sister, the flapper Dot Blem,\
  \ the great insigniaist drinks his tea from a flask, and has his boiled eggs balanced\
  \ in a contraption of wire and rubber bands and balsa wood.\nIt comes as something\
  \ of a surprise to learn that the avant-miners of the Avant-Colliery Marching Band\
  \ from Pointy Town have no insignia of their own. They seem happy enough to have\
  \ co-opted the generic Pointy Town badge, emblazoned on the backs of their helmets.\
  \ What they lack in visual zip, however, is more than made up for by their musical\
  \ prowess. With their tubas and xylophones and oompah-parpers, they march across\
  \ the bridge in the wake of the pole-vaulters, playing a repertoire including Scriabin,\
  \ Arnold Bax, transcriptions from field recordings of howler monkeys, and Kinnie\
  \ The Explorer.\nThe field in which the howler monkeys were recorded is, of course,\
  \ a very different field from the squelchy, squelchy mud-strewn one in which the\
  \ jamboree takes place when the Community Pole-Vaulting Collective and the Avant-Colliery\
  \ Marching Band have crossed the bridge and successfully negotiated their way past\
  \ the heavily-armed sentries. Drawn exclusively from the ranks of the most sociopathic\
  \ cadets, the sentries have their own insignia and their own music, buzzed directly\
  \ into their ears by transmitters which pick up signals from the netherworld. Ticketholders\
  \ have nothing to fear from the sentries, but woe betide the fool who tries to skulk\
  \ past their concrete huts ticketless. What do you think is the reason for that\
  \ line of heads impaled on spikes, stretching as far as the eye can see?\nThanks\
  \ to Roland for the Community Pole-Vaulting Collective (and insignia) and to Robin\
  \ for the Avant-Colliery Marching Band.\n[2011-02-16]"
