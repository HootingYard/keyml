text: "\nExtracts from the journal of M. de Sorr, a literary man from Paris:\n27 April\
  \ 1854. Faffing about aimlessly, wondering how to celebrate tomorrow's feast day\
  \ of Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673\u20131716). As luck would have\
  \ it I bumped into a vague acquaintance, M. Hardy, who said he was making a balloon\
  \ ascent tomorrow, and would I care to join him? I replied that I would very much\
  \ like to do so.\n28 April 1854. I met with M. Hardy as arranged, in a field on\
  \ the outskirts of Cannes. Beyond some palings, les vaches were mooing. We ignored\
  \ them and clambered into the basket, or \u201Ccar\u201D of the balloon. Shortly\
  \ afterwards, responding to a call from someone in the crowd of spectators who had\
  \ gathered, the chap holding the ropes let them go, and we began our ascent. I noted\
  \ that Hardy looked somewhat disconcerted, and asked him why.\n\u201CWe have begun\
  \ our ascent prematurely,\u201D he replied, \u201CThe aeronaut who was meant to\
  \ be with us had not yet clambered aboard. I myself am entirely ignorant of the\
  \ management of a balloon. What about you, is that something you know of?\u201D\n\
  \u201CNot a sausage,\u201D I replied, as we rose through the clouds. Below, the\
  \ earth disappeared from view.\nIt seemed we were in a proper pickle. But an aeronautical\
  \ pickle did not quite explain the expression on M. Hardy's countenance, where disconcertment\
  \ had now been replaced by abject terror. Deploying the interrogation techniques\
  \ I had learned as chef d'interrogateurs for the French postal service, I questioned\
  \ him closely. Hardy turned out to be a Muggletonian, and as such, he believed that\
  \ when we got six miles up we would crash into the sky. I shook him by the lapels\
  \ and slapped him round the chops in an attempt to knock some sense into him. He\
  \ curled up in a pitiable ball on the floor of the basket, weeping.\nConsidering\
  \ him a hopeless case, I busied myself by making an inventory of the basket. There\
  \ was a hand-held rudder, a fan, a packet of biscuits, five bottles of champagne,\
  \ a barometer, and an illustrated album of bird engravings. The air was growing\
  \ thinner as we continued our ascent. I said a prayer asking Saint Louis-Marie Grignion\
  \ de Montfort to intercede on our behalf, and then took a refreshing nap.\nWhen\
  \ I awoke, we were much much higher, and Hardy was no longer curled up on the floor.\
  \ He was standing, leaning against the side of the basket, gazing out at the boundless\
  \ firmament. I snapped my fingers in front of his face\u2014foof-la!\u2014but got\
  \ no response. Instantly, I realised that he had suffered a complete mental collapse.\
  \ We must have passed the six mile mark, I reasoned, and not crashed into a solid\
  \ sky, thus utterly destroying the Muggletonian concept of the cosmos. Hardy's brain\
  \ had lost its moorings, and he could not comprehend the inexplicable new world\
  \ he had entered.\nLuckily for both of us, I could. I cracked open a bottle of champagne.\n\
  \u201COnwards to the moon!\u201D I cried.\n29 April 1854. Hardy seemed a little\
  \ more composed today. I have been running through some of his theological difficulties\
  \ with him, and giving him the opportunity to use my rosary beads. I explained that\
  \ the Mariolatry of Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort knocks Muggletonianism\
  \ into a cocked hat. The air around us is thinner still, and no longer blue but\
  \ black, and shimmering with stars. To my surprise, there are still one or two birds\
  \ flitting around, though not ones I recognise, nor are they depicted in the album\
  \ of engravings. Indeed, the only reason I call them birds is because they have\
  \ wings. Come to think of it, they may be some form of high-flying insect. Hardy\
  \ suggests they are angels. He may be right. There is one bottle of champagne left,\
  \ and a couple of biscuits.\n30 April 1854. As I suspected, we are heading straight\
  \ for the moon. After two days of continuous ascent, it is a curious feeling to\
  \ be descending. Hardy has made a grand recovery, though he will not let go of the\
  \ rosary beads and thumped me on the windpipe when I foolishly attempted to retrieve\
  \ them from his grasp. When I was able to speak again, I told him to prepare himself\
  \ for our moon landing.\n\u201CHold on to your hat!\u201D I cried.\nTen minutes\
  \ later, we settled gently on the lunar surface. It was all very exciting. We both\
  \ peered into the distance, and were surprised to see a little trail of dust-clouds\
  \ heading towards us. On closer inspection, we saw the billows of dust were caused\
  \ by the footsteps of a man\u2014or, we supposed, an angel, or a moon-being. But\
  \ no, it was a man after all.\n\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D he said, as\
  \ he reached the basket. His accent was American. He was rather diminutive and weedy,\
  \ with a little moustache and a haunted look in his eyes.\n\u201CGreetings good\
  \ fellow,\u201D I said, \u201CI am M. de Sorr, a literary man from Paris, and this\
  \ is my vague acquaintance M. Hardy, a Muggletonian recently converted to Roman\
  \ Catholicism, who has developed a fanatical devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\
  \ As you can see, we arrived here by hot air balloon.\u201D\n\u201CAs did I,\u201D\
  \ said the American, \u201CFive years ago. And I too am a literary man. I am also\
  \ neurasthenic, and I do not wish to teeter over the edge into full-blown insanity\
  \ by having to deal with you two. Please leave me alone.\u201D\n\u201CYou are a\
  \ prickly little fellow to be sure,\u201D I said.\n\u201CPrickly I may be, but at\
  \ least when I have written of ascents by hot air balloon to the moon, and similar\
  \ tales of unlikely adventure, I have taken care to be as scientifically accurate\
  \ as the present state of knowledge makes possible. You strike me, if I may say\
  \ so, as the kind of literary gentleman who takes no such care with your narrative.\
  \ Even if you disguise it as a factual journal of events, it would not surprise\
  \ me if you roundly ignore all claims of credibility.\u201D\n\u201CI fear you are\
  \ correct, sir,\u201D I said, \u201CAnd M. Hardy and I will leave you to your own\
  \ devices. We shall once more ascend in our hot air balloon, though we are both\
  \ entirely ignorant of its management, and go forth, wherever it takes us.\u201D\
  \nAs an afterthought, I offered him our remaining bottle of champagne as a parting\
  \ gift.\n\u201CNo thank you,\u201D he said, \u201COne drop of the hard stuff and\
  \ I stagger around as if in the advanced stages of inebriation. It won me a rather\
  \ unseemly reputation by the time I left the planet Earth in 1849.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Well, good luck to you, sir,\u201D I said. And Hardy and I ascended once more, bound\
  \ for who knows where?\n[2012-07-28]"
