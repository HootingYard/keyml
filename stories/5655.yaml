text: "\u201CIn the dying hours of the year, in a foul and ill-lit alleyway, a raddled\
  \ rou\xE9, staggering out of a den of vice, was set upon by a ruffian. The ruffian\
  \ biffed the rou\xE9 upon the bonce, and kicked him on the shins, just above his\
  \ spats, and thumped him in the stomach, and the rou\xE9 crumpled to the ground,\
  \ winded and helpless in the noisome filth. Then the ruffian stamped his big black\
  \ boot upon the rou\xE9's biffed bonce, and spat upon his person, and stalked off\
  \ down the alleyway into the night. And soon thereafter came the pealing of bells,\
  \ ringing in the new year, and from a clump of dark trees in the park, the hooting\
  \ of an owl.\u201D\nThus begins Pebblehead's paperback potboiler The Ruffian Biffo,\
  \ His Book, surely the most relentlessly violent novel ever published. Its four\
  \ hundred pages consist of little more than descriptions of the ruffian Biffo biffing\
  \ and kicking and punching and thumping a series of victims, from the raddled rou\xE9\
  \ staggering from a den of vice to a preening fop on a roister doister, a dandy\
  \ in the doorway of a bordello, a macaroni on horseback and a pantalooned magnifico\
  \ on his way to un ballo en maschera.\nInterspersed with these almost identical\
  \ scenes, Pebblehead makes a few half-witted attempts to probe the interior life\
  \ of his ruffianly protagonist. Biffo, we are told, is variously \u201Ca card-carrying\
  \ communist\u201D, \u201Cdevoted to his dear old mum\u201D, and \u201Ca wizard at\
  \ the loom\u201D. To be fair, there is one lengthy and anomalous passage (pp. 103\u2013\
  149) where Biffo weaves a blanket for his mother, a blanket emblazoned with a hammer-and-sickle\
  \ and a daringly avant-garde portrait of Stalin.\nIn an interview, Pebblehead did\
  \ not claim, as one might have expected him to, that this scene\u2014beautifully\
  \ written and astonishing in its detail of blanket-weaving and communist ideology\u2014\
  is the \u201Cheart of the novel\u201D. In fact he was quite shameless in his insistence\
  \ that Biffo's biffings and kickings and punchings and thumpings are what the book\
  \ is \u201Cabout\u201D, adding that he only threw in the other material because\
  \ he had a head cold and drank too many beakers of Lemsip.\nIt is difficult to know\
  \ what to make of the book, but like all Pebblehead's paperback potboilers, it is\
  \ a bestseller. Apparently, he plans to follow it up with a spin-off about the raddled\
  \ rou\xE9, following his debauches in the weeks leading up to the fateful encounter\
  \ with Biffo. \u201CI am hoping,\u201D announced the writer from his chalet o\u2019\
  \ prose, \u201CThat the next book will prove to be the most relentlessly debauched\
  \ novel ever published. After that I shall move on to a mawkish and vapid heist\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 espionage romantic science fiction teenage detective blockbuster,\
  \ with vampires.\u201D\n[2010-12-06]"
