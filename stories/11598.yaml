text: "\nOver at The Dabbler this week I round up some amusements of the learned,\
  \ including Baruch Spinoza's pastime of setting spiders to fight each other and\
  \ then laughing immoderately at the result.\nThere is mention of James Boswell too,\
  \ which inspired Jonathan Law in the comments to note this intriguing passage from\
  \ The Life Of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791):\nIt seems [Johnson] had been frequently\
  \ observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had\
  \ squeezed the juice of them into the drink he made for himself. Beauclerk and Garrick\
  \ talked of it to me, and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to\
  \ be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold\
  \ question to be put.\nI saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some\
  \ fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. \u201CO, Sir, (said I) I now partly\
  \ see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the\
  \ Club.\u201D JOHNSON: \u201CI have a great love for them.\u201D BOSWELL: \u201C\
  And pray, Sir, what do you do with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly,\
  \ and what next?\u201D JOHNSON: \u201CI let them dry, Sir.\u201D BOSWELL: \u201C\
  And what next?\u201D JOHNSON: \u201CNay, Sir, you shall know their fate no further.\u201D\
  \ BOSWELL: \u201CThen the world must be left in the dark. It must be said (assuming\
  \ a mock solemnity) he scraped them, and let them dry, but what he did with them\
  \ next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell.\u201D JOHNSON: \u201CNay, Sir,\
  \ you should say it more emphatically:\u2014he could not be prevailed upon, even\
  \ by his dearest friends, to tell.\u201D\nIt seems to me that Sherlock Holmes, having\
  \ cleared up that business about The Five Orange Pips, ought to have turned his\
  \ attention to The Mysterious Case Of Dr Johnson And His Collection Of Orange Peel.\n\
