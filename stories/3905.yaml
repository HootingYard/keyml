text: "\u201CThe first volume in the series, The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol, was\
  \ necessarily confined to the activities of the young organization; but Rob and\
  \ his mates met and overcame many difficulties that are well worth reading about.\n\
  \u201CIn the second volume, The Boy Scouts on the Range, were recounted a series\
  \ of strange adventures that befell some of the Eagles during a visit to the Far\
  \ Southwest, where they took part in the wild life of a cattle ranch.\n\u201CThrough\
  \ the pages of The Boy Scouts and the Army Airship the reader will find that Rob\
  \ and his comrades always bore themselves manfully, no matter the emergency; and\
  \ that they scrupulously observed \u2018scout law\u2019 under any and every occasion,\
  \ as every true wearer of the khaki makes it a point to do.\n\u201CAfter this, followed\
  \ an account of many remarkable happenings that befell the Eagles when under canvas.\
  \ The Boy Scouts\u2019 Mountain Camp has deservedly been reckoned one of the very\
  \ best scout books ever published for boys, and those who own a copy are likely\
  \ to read it many times.\n\u201COnce more, chance allowed some of the leading characters\
  \ in the Hampton Troop to come in touch with Government officers who were experimenting\
  \ with a wonderfully designed submarine. It happened that Rob and his friends were\
  \ enabled to assist Uncle Sam's agents in defeating the plans of foreign spies who\
  \ tried to steal the design of the new invention. In the pages of The Boy Scouts\
  \ for Uncle Sam are recorded the adventures that accompanied their service, as well\
  \ as mention of the reward following their victory.\n\u201CIt was a happy chance\
  \ that allowed some of the boys to pay a visit to the then uncompleted Panama Canal.\
  \ While in the Canal Zone they again demonstrated that they were always wide-awake\
  \ and devoted to the service of their country. Much useful information will also\
  \ be found between the covers of this volume, called The Boy Scouts at the Panama\
  \ Canal.\n\u201COnce more, Rob and several of his close adherents were unexpectedly\
  \ allowed to take a trip. Andy Bowles, the bugler of the troop, had an uncle who\
  \ owned a cattle ranch down in Chihuahua, in Mexico. He was sick, and unable to\
  \ go down himself to dispose of the stock before the fighting forces of rebels and\
  \ Federals drove the herds away. Accordingly, he sent his nephew and several of\
  \ his chums to seek General Villa, whom he had once befriended, and gain his assistance\
  \ in selling the valuable stock. The wonderful things they saw, and the peculiar\
  \ adventures that came their way, have all been described in the seventh volume,\
  \ just preceding this, under the title of The Boy Scouts Under Fire in Mexico.\n\
  \u201CThat, telling briefly some of the remarkable things that happened in their\
  \ career as Boy Scouts, will have to suffice to introduce Rob and his two chums\
  \ to the reader.\u201D\nFrom The Boy Scouts On Belgian Battlefields by Lieutenant\
  \ Howard Payson (1915)\n[2010-02-13]"
