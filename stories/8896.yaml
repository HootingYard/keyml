text: "The title of this piece ought to be For Those In Peril On The Sea, but so caught\
  \ up am I in my series of \u201COn\u2026\u201D essay titles that it seemed a shame\
  \ to muck it up. Hence the somewhat forced rephrasing, which doesn't even pass muster\
  \ as an entry in an index, where it would be better put as Sea, The, For Those In\
  \ Peril On. I am sure there are other ways to rearrange the words, depending upon\
  \ which term one wished to give due prominence\u2014Those or Peril, for example\u2014\
  but I am not going to waste my time and yours by further shilly-shallying. We need\
  \ to get down to business, which today is to respond to the following letter, received\
  \ from reader Tim Thurn:\nNow look here, Mr Key, he hectors, I cannot be alone in\
  \ wondering why you seem never to mention the sinking of the RMS Titanic. You bang\
  \ on and on, to the point of tedium, about the Munich Air Disaster and the Hindenburg\
  \ and, though they are not disasters of the same kidney, notable twentieth century\
  \ events such as the Kennedy assassination and the Tet Offensive. Yet of the Titanic,\
  \ barely a word, though a brief search reveals that you use (or overuse) the word\
  \ titanic to describe the pamphleteer Dobson. This weekend we will mark the one\
  \ hundredth anniversary of the loss of the liner in the icy wastes of the north\
  \ Atlantic, so I think it is about bloody time you turned your attention to it,\
  \ if you can drag yourself away from peering myopically out of the window at crows\
  \ and at whatever else you peer at when you look out of the window. Get a grip.\
  \ Passionately yours, Tim Thurn.\nWell, that's me told. It might surprise Mr Thurn\
  \ to learn that I am something of a Titanic scholar, having at one point in my life\
  \ read many, many books on the subject. I think I may acquit myself fairly well\
  \ were I to take it as a quiz subject. To take a snippet at random, I know, for\
  \ example, that second mate Charles Lightoller, who survived the sinking, was later\
  \ decorated for various heroics during the First World War and played his part in\
  \ the Second by sailing one of the \u201Clittle ships\u201D across the channel in\
  \ the evacuation of Dunkirk. Also, if he had been reading these essays, Mr Thurn\
  \ would know that I grew up living not far away from Eva Hart, one of the longest-lived\
  \ survivors of the disaster, though it is true that I never went calling on her\
  \ to winkle out her memories, nor did I ever go the pub named after her to raise\
  \ a glass in memory of all those who drowned on that dreadful night in what Mr Thurn\
  \ likes to call \u201Cthe icy wastes of the north Atlantic\u201D.\nOf all the books\
  \ I read, my favourite was Titanic\_: Psychic Forewarnings Of A Tragedy by George\
  \ Behe (1989), which collects over one hundred accounts of premonitory dreams and\
  \ visions and so on. Amusingly, as far as I recall, every single one of these accounts\
  \ was recorded after the fifteenth of April 1912, so we have someone writing in,\
  \ say, 1920 about a dream they had in 1910. Interestingly, not one of the psychic\
  \ forewarnings features either Kate Winslet or Leonardo Di Caprio, who many young\
  \ persons today believe portrayed real historical characters in the 1997 James Cameron\
  \ blockbuster. Given the parlous state of history teaching in our self-esteem and\
  \ diversity hubs, it is a small mercy that I have yet to hear of a youngster exclaiming\
  \ with shock that the ship sinks at the end of the film.\nOn Sunday, I shall be\
  \ marking the anniversary as I always do. I corral a choir of tinies and take them\
  \ to Nameless Pond, my local duckpond. It is not the north Atlantic, nor at this\
  \ time of year is it icy, nor is it indeed the sea, but I live far from the sea,\
  \ and it is, after all, a body of water, and a better site for the commemoration\
  \ than, say, a bathtub or butler sink. We launch a paper boat upon the pond, and\
  \ then the tinies sing the Victorian hymn Eternal Father, Strong To Save by William\
  \ Whiting, which, of course, contains the couplet \u201COh, hear us when we cry\
  \ to Thee, / For those in peril on the sea!\u201D The hymn was also used by Benjamin\
  \ Britten in Noye's Fludde (1957), though not sung by the tinies. It was also the\
  \ final hymn sung at the Sunday service on the Titanic on Sunday the fourteenth\
  \ of April 1912, just hours before the sinking. If our paper boat has been folded\
  \ into shape with sufficient cack-handedness, it usually sinks under the weight\
  \ of its cargo of pebbles while the tinies are singing. If it does not, I get them\
  \ to repeat the hymn from the beginning, while chucking further pebbles at the paper\
  \ boat in hopes of scuppering it. We like to pretend that the various ducks disporting\
  \ themselves upon the pond are the Titanic's lifeboats. In order to compensate for\
  \ the disparities in scale\u2014some of the ducks are actually bigger than our paper\
  \ boat\u2014we squint or, in my case, remove our spectacles so the whole scene is\
  \ a blur.\nOne year, during this mournful little ceremony, a passing duckpond-circumnavigating\
  \ pedestrian buttonholed me to ask what we were doing. When I explained, he pointed\
  \ out that, though we had recreated the ship (a paper boat) and the lifeboats (the\
  \ ducks), there was nothing to represent the iceberg. Without this, he said, our\
  \ memorial singsong was a mere farrago. Sadly, I had to agree. It is thus pleasing\
  \ to note that, as the tone of Nameless Pond and its surroundings are dragged ever\
  \ further into barbarism by the local riffraff, some antisocial scalliwag has tossed\
  \ an abandoned fridge into the water.\nPerhaps Mr Thurn should come and join us\
  \ on Sunday, and bring his funerary violin.\n\n[2012-04-11]"
