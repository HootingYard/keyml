text: 'Ahoy there, Frank!, writes Tim Thurn, irritatingly, Are you sure you''re not
  confusing Dobson''s Cacodaemon with his Cocoademon? I recall reading somewhere that
  the titanic pamphleteer once unscrewed the lid from a jar of cocoa and unleashed
  a ferocious sprite which made his life a misery for about a week. Everywhere he
  went he found cocoa powder splattered in his path. Some of us wouldn''t be too bothered
  by that. If it were me, I''d avail myself of a little plastic scoop, and scoop up
  the cocoa powder, because I truly love cocoa, and drink seven or eight mugs of it
  a day. But apparently Dobson wasn''t so fond, and he was only unscrewing the lid
  from the jar as research for his pamphlet Notes Upon The Unscrewing Of Lids From
  Jars (out of print). He hadn''t even bought the jar of cocoa, he was just wandering
  through the aisles in Hubermann''s Food Hall hoping no one would spot what he was
  doing. I have never read that pamphlet, by the way, so is there any chance you could
  find a copy and transcribe it on your splendid website?

  Dear Tim, replies Mr Key, Making up titles of spurious Dobson pamphlets is no way
  for a grown man to behave. I suggest you do something more useful with your life,
  such as projectile vomiting in the direction of Andy Burnham.
