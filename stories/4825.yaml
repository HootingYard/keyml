text: 'It gurgled, then it swept away. What it was I could not say. I saw it in a
  looking-glass, just after a mesmeric pass. The medium''s hands passed down my spine,
  moving in a plumb straight line. I glanced into the mirror then and counted slowly
  up to ten. The thing appeared atop my head. Its talons tore. It slashed. I bled.
  Then it gurgled and swept away. I''m going to sell it on eBay if I can find out
  where it went. The medium, by the way, is bent. Bent and crooked, a charlatan. He
  said he''d summon the Grunty Man. Instead this thing attacked and fled, leaving
  a gash upon my head. I must apply a poultice now, then turn the medium into a cow
  by casting a fiendish spell on him, a spell so fiendish and so grim that he''ll
  regret he messed with me. I am the Grunty Man, you see.
