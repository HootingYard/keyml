text: "Songs For Strangled Puppies is a new album of sentimental ballads by tear-stained\
  \ balladeer Biff Chomsky, a follow-up to his smash hit bestseller Songs For Drowned\
  \ Kittens.\n\u201CI am particularly proud of this new waxing\u201D said Biff in\
  \ an interview with top dead-puppy-and-kitten magazine The Daily Small Slaughtered\
  \ Animals Digest, \u201CBecause the body count is slightly higher than on my previous\
  \ album. That had only one or two kittens drowned per song, whereas on the new one,\
  \ I sing several schmaltzy ballads in which upwards of a dozen puppies have the\
  \ life squeezed out of them, in one case by the lumbering walrus-moustached serial\
  \ killer Babinsky, turning his attention for once to the canine world.\u201D\nThis\
  \ is not the first time Babinsky has been celebrated in song, though earlier numbers\
  \ have eschewed the tear-stained ballad approach. More often they have been hideous\
  \ screechings and howlings composed by bearded grumpy avant garde German nitwits\
  \ such as Horst Gack and Horst Gack's familiar, a weird homunculus which perches\
  \ on his shoulder and hisses at passers-by.\n\u201CI was hoping to get Horst Gack's\
  \ homunculus to join me on a duet,\u201D said Biff Chomsky, \u201CBut when I approached\
  \ him, he bit me. I immediately had a tetanus jab, but it didn't do much good. Ever\
  \ since I have had a fever and an ague and fits and convulsions and to be honest\
  \ I'm not sure when I'll be able to get back in the studio to record my next album,\
  \ Songs For Garrotted Baby Koala Bears.\u201D\nEach copy of the new album comes\
  \ with a free tin pail in which weeping listeners can collect their tears.\n[2017-01-28]"
