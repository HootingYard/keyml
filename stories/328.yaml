text: "A curious tale attaches itself to the shortest pamphlet Dobson ever published.\
  \ Of a light-hearted, even frisky, disposition one foul winter's day, he wrote as\
  \ follows:\nObtain a large jug of paraffin. Remove the cap from the jug and slosh\
  \ the paraffin over a pile of something dry and brittle in a public place. Toss\
  \ a lighted match onto it, stand back, and watch the resulting blaze. This will\
  \ warm your cockles and provide a pleasing spectacle to pass the time of day.\n\
  Having nothing further to add, the pamphleteer persuaded Marigold Chew to set these\
  \ four sentences in a particularly decisive and heroic typeface, and issued it under\
  \ the unambiguous title Fun With Paraffin! For the cover, Marigold Chew chose a\
  \ mezzotint by the mezzotintist Rex Tint, depicting his sister Dot Tint hand-tinting\
  \ one of his mezzotints with a paraffin-based colourant. Before doing any typesetting\
  \ or production work on the pamphlet, however, Marigold Chew had a fractious to-do\
  \ with Dobson over his use of the word jug. She insisted that a jug was by definition\
  \ an open-necked container, and that he should prefer the word canister, for a canister\
  \ would have a cap, and be a more likely receptacle for paraffin, than would a jug,\
  \ which, though it may be fitted with a plug or stopper, would never have a cap.\n\
  Dobson never took kindly to having his errors pointed out to him, believing that\
  \ the sheer force of his prose, even in so short a pamphlet as this, ought to silence\
  \ his critics. He was fond of quoting Christopher Smart's line from Jubilate Agno,\
  \ where the poet says \u201CFor I pray God for the ostriches of Salisbury Plain,\
  \ the beavers of the Medway, and silver fish of Thames\u201D. Sorry, wrong line.\
  \ I was distracted there for a moment by a freshly-laundered dishcloth flapping\
  \ in the breeze. The line Dobson liked to use to defend himself against detractors\
  \ was \u201CFor my talent is to give an Impression upon words by punching, that\
  \ when the reader casts his eye upon \u2018em, he takes up the image from the mould\
  \ which I have made\u201D.\nMarigold Chew, though, was a stickler, and challenged\
  \ Dobson to produce, in the real world rather than from the skewed universe inside\
  \ his skull, a jug sealed with a cap. Characteristically, the pamphleteer tried\
  \ to shirk this by muttering some nonsense about his urgent need to examine a nest\
  \ of stints in a shrubbery over by the pond. Why on earth he persisted in his lifelong\
  \ delusion that ornithology could rescue him from any pickle he found himself in\
  \ is a question for wiser heads than mine. Marigold Chew made short shrift of his\
  \ stinty babblings, of course, and Dobson was left with no choice but to head off\
  \ to Hubermann's in the hope that somewhere on the shelves of that unutterably gorgeous\
  \ department store he might pounce upon a capped jug.\nAnd therein lies the strangeness\
  \ of this tale. For as he approached the plaza where Hubermann's loomed enormous,\
  \ he found the building enshrouded in a weird mauve mist, like the purple cloud\
  \ in M P Shiel's novel of that title, and he wandered into the mist, and through\
  \ the doors of Hubermann's, and there in the foyer he came upon a tottering tower\
  \ of jugs, all with screw-top caps, and all filled to the brim with paraffin, and\
  \ he was convulsed by a desire to toss a lighted match upon them, and to pass an\
  \ entertaining time watching the blaze, just as he had described in his yet-to-be-typeset\
  \ pamphlet. But as he reached into his pocket for a box of lucifers, he was felled\
  \ by an eagle-eyed Hubermann's security guard, a titanic monster of a man whose\
  \ epaulettes glistened in the mist and whose buttons glistened in the mist even\
  \ more than his epaulettes so glistened. And Dobson was kept under lock and key\
  \ in a broom cupboard in the basement of the department store until bailed by an\
  \ eerie, cadaverous magistrate who roved the land on horseback, following the mauve\
  \ mist wherever it settled.\nHome again, fuddled and with mysterious mauve stainage\
  \ upon his clothing, the pamphleteer told his tale to Marigold Chew, who, despite\
  \ raising a skeptical eyebrow, skipped at once to her shed and cranked out Dobson's\
  \ pamphlet with the text as Dobson wanted it, the world once again cast from the\
  \ mould his words had made.\n[2008-01-02]"
