  \ Brent Houghtaling has had the bright idea of applying Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies\
  \ in the kitchen. Here at Hooting Yard, of course, we do not need the assistance\
  \ of the man we know as Brain One (anag.) to inspire our culinary bagatelles. Here\
  \ is the latest recipe from occasional contributor Fatima Gilliblat.\nBoiled (or\
  \ Broiled) Conger Eel with Sandwich Paste and Brazil Nuts\nTake one fully-grown\
  \ adult conger eel of handsome parts. Rinse it thoroughly in freezing cold water,\
  \ then dab it dry with a large rectangular beach towel.\nFill an eel-shaped pan\
  \ with water, place on the hob! hob! hob! and bring to the boil (or broil). Plunge\
  \ the conger eel into the seething liquid in one easy, elegant, yet startling movement.\
  \ Add a dash of ground pepper. Leave to simmer for 45 minutes.\nTransfer the boiled\
  \ (or broiled) conger eel onto a platter. Open a medium-sized jar of sandwich paste\
  \ and spoon the entire contents onto the eel. Use a butter knife to spread the paste\
  \ so it coats pretty much the whole topside. Place under the grill and toast for\
  \ ten minutes, or until the colour of Turbinado sugar.\nToss a few brazil nuts onto\
  \ the platter, and serve. Best eaten with bare hands, tearing the conger eel to\
  \ shreds, in a sort of frenzy, while listening to the Missa Luba on your hi-fi.\n\
