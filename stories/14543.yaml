text: 'The plan for 2016 was to post a potsage [sic] here every day. In January, I
  succeeded, but come the first day of the second month and the plan was as dust and
  ashes in my mouth. Yesterday I felt decidedly uurrgghh and lay abed, with occasional
  visits to the Thunder Box, over which we shall draw a heavy black veil. Today I
  feel almost equally uurrgghh. However, quite fortuitously, I posted two potsages
  on Sunday. I think what we shall do is to pretend that the RIP for Jacques Rivette
  actually appeared yesterday, and prance on regardless. I hope to feel less uurrgghh
  tomorrow, Now, back to bed.
