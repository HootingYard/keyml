text: "I read in the paper today that the Archbishop of York's press officer is himself\
  \ being ordained as a priest. He has taken this step because, apparently, he \u201C\
  wants to be more like Jesus Christ\u201D. If we accept his belief system for a moment,\
  \ what he is saying is that he wants to be more like God. Such overweening ambition\
  \ is usually a worrying sign, and almost always delusional, and people who say things\
  \ like that are likely to get locked up, or at least be given an Asbo. When his\
  \ careers officer asked the teenage future press person what he wanted to be, did\
  \ he answer \u201CGod!\u201D, with a demented gleam in his eyes? His name, by the\
  \ way, is Arun Arora, rather than Caligula, but you know the type.\nSome may say\
  \ there's nothing wrong with setting your sights high, but if you're going to become\
  \ a god, Jesus Christ seems a poor choice. If it were me, I'd go for one of the\
  \ more belligerent Aztec or Ancient Egyptian gods, or perhaps something epic and\
  \ Nordic, like Odin, although I suppose the heavy metal associations would become\
  \ something of an embarrassment. In the end, I think I'd plump for the hideous bat-god\
  \ Fatso. There would be none of that nonsense with loaves and fishes, or getting\
  \ crucified, but lots and lots of cakes and pastries.\nAll of which is an excuse\
  \ to republish another item from the Archive, a piece entitled Cake And Pastry Person.\
  \ It originally appeared in July 2006.\n\nMany, many years ago, so long ago that\
  \ you were probably not yet born, there was a cake and pastry person who drove a\
  \ van around Pang Hill and Blister Lane, tooting a horn in the summer afternoons,\
  \ for it seemed the sun was always shining in those far away days. Those were times\
  \ when children still bought cakes and pastries from a van, a big pantechnicon painted\
  \ yellow and red and pink and mauve and black.\nIt was also, of course, the time\
  \ when people worshipped the hideous bat-god Fatso, and walked the earth in fear\
  \ of his flapping wings and his shrill squeaking that churned up the innards and\
  \ pierced the soul. Where, in other lands, the roads would be lined by milestones\
  \ telling the distance to an important town or port, here there were hundreds and\
  \ hundreds of huge stone carvings of Fatso, the visible reminder of his terrible,\
  \ and terribly haphazard, power. Children were protected from the worst of his wrath,\
  \ for Fatso the bat-god did not fully reveal himself until a person reached adulthood.\
  \ For tinies, the stone statues were simply part of the landscape, like trees or\
  \ kiosks or pneumatic power towers.\nAlthough the bat-god is forgotten today, everyone\
  \ remembers the resin hoops that were the favourite plaything of young and old alike.\
  \ I am sure you know the words to the old song. \u201CWe skip and frolic and loop\
  \ the loops / Along Pang Hill with our resin hoops / We skip and frolic on Blister\
  \ Lane / With our resin hoops we loop again.\u201D Sometimes children would play\
  \ at tossing their hoops over a Fatso statue, giving the bat-god a necklace. Everyone\
  \ knew that a hoop's resin, once resting around the stone neck of the god, would\
  \ begin immediately to rot, and that by the next morning nothing would remain but\
  \ a squelchy, foul-smelling string of glutinous goo, drippety-dripping on to the\
  \ ground, where soon vile prickly poisonous weeds would sprout.\nThese were the\
  \ roads up and down which the cake and pastry person's van would trundle, slowing\
  \ to a halt whenever a little crowd of tinies gathered, each child clutching a cake\
  \ and pastry token. In an excited gaggle, the children would exchange their tokens\
  \ for cakes and pastries, and the cake and pastry person would collect the tokens\
  \ in his token tin, which rattled when he shook it, and shake it he did, to hear\
  \ that pleasing rattle. He beamed at the children as he handed out his cakes and\
  \ pastries and took their tokens and rattled his token tin, but an acute observer\
  \ might see that the beam was a false, rictus grin, for the cake and pastry person\
  \ was plunged in melancholy. He remembered the innocent times when he, too, had\
  \ been able to eat cakes and pastries without a care. Now, like every adult in the\
  \ land, his days were consumed by a desperate need to placate Fatso the hideous\
  \ bat-god. It seemed that Fatso needed more and more tokens every day, and the cake\
  \ and pastry person was seldom satisfied until his tin was so crammed with tokens\
  \ that it no longer rattled. Only then could he cease driving his pantechnicon round\
  \ and round the roads, and park by the perimeter fence of the swan sanctuary, and\
  \ take his tin, on foot, along the lane to Fatso's cave, and wait, with all the\
  \ other supplicants, for night to fall and for the bat-god's lieutenants to shimmer\
  \ into view. When at last his turn came, he would empty the tin into the outstretched\
  \ paws of a greedy and grasping lieutenant, and plead for benediction, but benediction\
  \ rarely came. Tomorrow, a bigger tin, more tokens. Thus was he commanded, in the\
  \ horrible high-pitched squeals of Fatso's inhuman myrmidons. One by one, then,\
  \ they would flit away with their booty into the deepest, darkest recesses of the\
  \ cave, and the cake and pastry person and all the other hunched and sorry believers\
  \ would traipse away, back to their huts and shacks and cabins, and try to snatch\
  \ a few brief hours of sleep before dawn broke and they faced a new day with redoubled\
  \ effort. As they slept, the resin hoops rotted on the statues of their bat-god,\
  \ poisonous weeds crept and curled along the ground, and in the nurseries, under\
  \ cover of the night, tiny children giggled with delight, happy that they had bolstered\
  \ Fatso's power for another day, sure in the knowledge that tomorrow would bring\
  \ more looping the loop with their resin hoops, more sunshine, and more cakes and\
  \ pastries from the cake and pastry person's yellow and red and pink and mauve and\
  \ black cake and pastry van.\n[2007-06-29]"
