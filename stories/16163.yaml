text: "I was sprawled on the sofa, dozing off as I read the latest issue of The Truncheon\
  \ Of Truth, when I was startled by an urgent pounding at the door.\n\u201CCome in!\u201D\
  \ I shouted, for the door was not locked. As I tossed my magazine on to the floor\
  \ and prepared to rise to greet my visitor, whoever it was, the door crashed open\
  \ and a man wearing a frock coat and a bippety-boppety hat came striding in. I immediately\
  \ recognised him as Tarleton, the amateur's amateur.\n\u201CWhy, as I live and breathe,\
  \ it is you, Tarleton!\u201D I yelled. Strictly speaking, none of these words was\
  \ actually necessary.\n\u201CSpare me your unnecessary words,\u201D rapped Tarleton,\
  \ \u201CPut on your coat and hat and boots and follow me. There is not a moment\
  \ to lose!\u201D\nThus began one of the more thrilling adventures of my long and,\
  \ for the most part, undistinguished life. I had no idea, at the time, that I was\
  \ to play a significant part in what became known as the affair of the Mitteleuropean\
  \ Crown Prince, the missing jewellery box, the dachshund, the drainage ditch, and\
  \ the freckle-faced lighthouse keeper. On that sopping wet Sunday morning I was\
  \ preoccupied with the fact that Tarleton had interrupted my reading of an article\
  \ in The Truncheon Of Truth on the subject of Blunkett.\n\u201CI was in the middle\
  \ of reading a very interesting piece about David Blunkett,\u201D I protested to\
  \ Tarleton as I hastened after him along the rain-swept streets of my bailiwick.\n\
  \u201CSave your breath, man!\u201D rapped Tarleton, \u201CAnd keep up! There is\
  \ not a moment to lose!\u201D\nWe turned down an alleyway next to the ice-cream\
  \ kiosk, and then down another alleyway, and another, and yet another, until I realised\
  \ that I was no longer in my familiar surroundings and had no idea where I was.\
  \ In spite of the fact that each alleyway was narrower and darker and more foetid\
  \ than the last, Tarleton kept up a cracking pace.\n\u201CAt the point when you\
  \ knocked,\u201D I panted, \u201CBlunkett had just entered a field wherein a cow\
  \ awaited him\u2014a cow that, I think, was about to attack him, on his birthday\
  \ to boot.\u201D\n\u201CYou looked as if you were dozing off when I arrived,\u201D\
  \ said Tarleton, \u201CSo you cannot have found the article that interesting. Now\
  \ hush!\u201D he added, and he made a melodramatic gesture, placing one silk-begloved\
  \ finger vertically in front of his lips. We stood, soaked, in front of a doorway\
  \ on which the paint was peeling, the wood was rotting, and the number 49 had been\
  \ scratched as if by the claws of a maddened bear.\n\u201CI was dozing off because\
  \ the prose was leaden,\u201D I said, \u201CBut the content in itself was absolutely\
  \ fascinating.\u201D\n\u201CFor God's sake hush!\u201D hissed Tarleton, and as he\
  \ did so he pushed the door open gingerly. It creaked on its hinges nevertheless.\
  \ \u201CFollow me down this secret corridor,\u201D he whispered.\nThe secret corridor\
  \ was unlit, and when the door swung shut behind me, I was as blind as Blunkett\
  \ in the pitch blackness. Recalling the article in The Truncheon Of Truth, I apprehended\
  \ just how terrifying it would be to be attacked by a cow. I groped forward and\
  \ clutched at the tail of Tarleton's frock coat, and we stumbled forward in the\
  \ Stygian gloom.\n\u201CWe are not likely to meet with a cow, I take it?\u201D I\
  \ whispered.\nTarleton hushed me for the third time.\nIn blackness and silence,\
  \ like the message of Sylvia Plath's yew tree, we made our way along the secret\
  \ corridor for what seemed to me untold hours but was, when I looked later at my\
  \ wristwatch, only a few minutes. We emerged eventually into the large and imposing\
  \ pantry of a large and imposing hotel, and now I was Blunkett-blinded not by darkness\
  \ but by the glare of several Klieg lights. Tarleton, ever prepared, snapped on\
  \ a pair of sunglasses.\n\u201CWe are only just in time!\u201D he cried.\nThere,\
  \ chained to the pantry wall, gagged and dishevelled, was a Mitteleuropean Crown\
  \ Prince, and on the floor at his feet a missing jewellery box. With one swift and\
  \ decisive move, Tarleton smashed the chains with an axe. Then he helped the Crown\
  \ Prince to his feet, pocketed the jewellery box, dusted down his frock coat, straightened\
  \ the bippety-boppety hat on his head, and prepared to leave the pantry through\
  \ a connecting door to a second, equally large and equally imposing pantry, from\
  \ where we could make our way to the hotel lobby, and then out into daylight and\
  \ safety and a majestic boulevard. As I made to follow, Tarleton turned, wagged\
  \ a silk-begloved finger in my face, and said. \u201CWait here!\u201D\nI never saw\
  \ Tarleton or the Mitteleuropean Crown Prince again. I kept myself occupied in the\
  \ pantry, rearranging the pots and pans and packet soups on the shelves, and doing\
  \ a little light dusting, until one day, weakened by hunger, I saw a hallucinatory\
  \ cow intent on attacking me, and I realised it was time to leave. I made my way\
  \ back through the secret corridor and out into the alleyway and the other alleyway\
  \ and the other alleyway and the other alleyway until I got my bearings and made\
  \ my way home. Several weeks\u2019 copies of The Truncheon Of Truth were piled up\
  \ on the doormat. I made myself an infusion of boiled lettucewater and sprawled\
  \ on the sofa to catch up on my reading. There was an article recounting in great\
  \ detail the affair of the Mitteleuropean Crown Prince, the missing jewellery box,\
  \ the dachshund, the drainage ditch, and the freckle-faced lighthouse keeper. Tarleton\
  \ was not mentioned, and nor was I\u2014at least, not in the first few paragraphs.\
  \ The piece was written in prose so leaden that before I read any further I dozed\
  \ off.\nI was startled by an urgent pounding at the door. But I had taken the precaution\
  \ of locking it, and I ignored the pounding, and went back to sleep.\n[2017-12-24]"
