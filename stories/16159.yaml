text: "Tarleton, the amateur's amateur, was sat one evening in an armchair in his\
  \ consulting rooms, constructing a working scale model of a hydroelectric power\
  \ station out of matchsticks and cardboard and glue and fusewire and hydroelectric\
  \ power, when there came a sudden urgent knocking, the door crashed open, and into\
  \ the room came a man holding, at arm's length, an asp.\n\u201CAre you Tarleton?\u201D\
  \ gasped the man. It was his last gasp, for as soon as the words were out of his\
  \ mouth he collapsed upon the carpet. In death, his grip on the asp was necessarily\
  \ relaxed, but the manner in which he fell meant that the asp was trapped under\
  \ the weight of his corpse. Its head, however, poked free, and it hissed in an aspy\
  \ way at Tarleton.\nThis, then, was the famous mystery of the asp, some say Tarleton's\
  \ finest hour. The mystery may be thought to have inhered in the identity of the\
  \ man who had come carrying an asp into the consulting-rooms, his purpose in bringing\
  \ the asp, and indeed in the provenance of the asp. There were certain other matters,\
  \ too, to which Tarleton needed to turn the cranks of his powerful mind, but those\
  \ mentioned are considered the main three. We might mention here that the dead man\
  \ had a pudding-basin haircut.\nBefore solving the mystery, Tarleton determined\
  \ to put the finishing touches to his model. He was unruffled by the hissing of\
  \ the asp, for he had, years before, gained mastery of a mystic oriental technique\
  \ for remaining unruffled in the presence of hissing asps, and indeed of other things\
  \ that hiss. One inadvertent consequence of his mastery was that, on the one occasion\
  \ Tarleton met Alger Hiss, the communist spy, he remained utterly unruffled, when\
  \ a certain rufflement might have spurred him to action, and he could have taken\
  \ steps to gather evidence of Hiss's perfidy, and thus saved Whittaker Chambers\
  \ a great deal of pother. Chambers, with his rotten infected teeth and shabby stained\
  \ suit, never forgave Tarleton for his languid lack of concern, and sent the amateur's\
  \ amateur several poison pen letters in succeeding years. These have now been collected\
  \ in The Correspondence Of Whittaker Chambers And Tarleton, The Amateur's Amateur,\
  \ a somewhat misleading title in that the word \u2018correspondence\u2019 suggests\
  \ that Tarleton replied, which he did not. He could not bestir himself to do so,\
  \ preferring to muck about with matchsticks and cardboard and glue and fusewire\
  \ and hydroelectric power. Having made one working scale model of a hydroelectric\
  \ power station, putting the finishing touches to it under the watchful eyes of\
  \ a hissing asp, Tarleton was so delighted with it that he immediately set about\
  \ making another. It was a hobby that kept him profitably occupied for a number\
  \ of years.\nObviously, he had to take a break from his model-making from time to\
  \ time, for example to sleep, to eat, to go for long hikes, to solve cases that\
  \ perplexed the best minds of the police force, and not least, to do something about\
  \ the asp. But before he could address the matter of the asp, Tarleton had to arrange\
  \ for the disposal of the corpse of the man who had burst into his consulting rooms\
  \ carrying the asp at arm's length. He placed a call to the local rascally illegal\
  \ disposer of corpses. One might ask why he did not seek to have the corpse disposed\
  \ of in a manner commensurate with the law. One might ask, but to no avail, for\
  \ Tarleton was notoriously tight-lipped about such things. Let us say it was not\
  \ the first time he had had a corpse disposed of illegally, nor the first time said\
  \ corpse had a pudding-basin haircut. It was, however, the first time the removal\
  \ of the corpse from his consulting rooms would release, from under its dead weight,\
  \ a hissing asp.\nTo this end, after making arrangements with the rascal, Tarleton\
  \ placed a second call, this one to an asp expert at a zoo.\n\u201CTell me about\
  \ asps,\u201D he said.\nThe asp expert took the call at a busy time, when he was\
  \ engaged in tackling some kind of zoo asp mayhem. It is the kind of thing that\
  \ happens all the time even at the best regulated zoos, and it is best you know\
  \ nothing more. The upshot, however, was that the expert could not afford the time\
  \ to spout all he knew of asps to Tarleton, as that would have taken several hours,\
  \ hours he did not have as he strained every sinew to avert zoo asp mayhem. All\
  \ he managed to splutter was some nonsense about the first asps having been created\
  \ from the spilled blood of the head of Medusa, borne aloft by Perseus on his flight\
  \ to Mount Olympus. He then slammed the phone down, leaving Tarleton little wiser\
  \ than he was before.\nAll this while, the mystery of the asp remained unsolved.\
  \ Yet we know there are those who say it was Tarleton's finest hour. Why would they\
  \ say such a thing? He sat there, faffing with matchsticks and cardboard and glue\
  \ and fusewire and hydroelectric power, and placing a couple of calls, occasionally\
  \ glancing over at the trapped hissing asp, and hissing back at it. Perhaps that\
  \ in itself is the mystery.\nWhen, later in the evening, the rascal appeared, to\
  \ make illegal disposal of the corpse, he spotted the asp and licked his lips and\
  \ asked Tarleton if he might remove, not just the corpse, but the asp into the bargain.\
  \ Tarleton nodded.\n\u201CThankee kindly, sir,\u201D said the rascal, doffing his\
  \ cap, \u201CThere's nothing I like better for a nightcap than a tot of asp's blood.\u201D\
  \ and he whacked the asp on its head with a lead-weighted sap, and dragged it from\
  \ under the corpse, and popped it in his pocket. We might mention here that the\
  \ rascal had a pudding-basin haircut atop a countenance that was the spit and image\
  \ of Alger Hiss.\n[2017-12-22]"
