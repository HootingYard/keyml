text: "Kloppstock's Jugband Crumpled Baize Tarboosh, the latest bestselling paperback\
  \ by Pebblehead, is a wonderful evocation of those much lamented Sappensopp Days.\
  \ \u201CTipping, tapping, flimflam\u2026 goose grease and lavender and a tin of\
  \ polish for the porch\u2026 the light in the tunnels and the flap of the flaps\
  \ in the flappery out by the byre\u2026 those endless bowls of piping hot porridge\u2026\
  \ such were the joys of the Sappensopp Days\u201D, he writes, and if, like me, you\
  \ are an unreconstructed Sappensoppist, it all comes flooding back.\nThere was an\
  \ earlier book, of course, by Inspip, and I stand by my review when it first came\
  \ out in hardback, where I wrote \u201CThis book is shoddy and inadequate and inadequate!\
  \ It is thoroughly inadequate!\u201D Inspip had the temerity to write what he called\
  \ A Thorough And Adequate Account Of Those Sappensopp Days, despite being a secret\
  \ Soppensappist. When I revealed this gruesome truth Inspip was discredited and\
  \ his bones were thrown off a cliff into the churning ocean. Good riddance to him,\
  \ say I.\nPebblehead, by contrast, has the measure of those Sappensopp Days. It\
  \ seems he has listened to contemporary tape recordings of claimants and wardens\
  \ and tosspots, and although his tone is often desperate, when it is not twittering,\
  \ he nails it. By \u201Cit\u201D I mean a very concrete sense of urbane jugband\
  \ merriment. And the names you would expect are all here, though I cannot repeat\
  \ any of them for legal reasons. I don't want my bones to follow Inspip's off that\
  \ gaunt and mighty cliff.\nThe point about Pebblehead's prose in his examination\
  \ of Sappensoppism is that he chugs along, chug chug chug, in a way that is attractive\
  \ to those who like their prose to have that kind of locomotive trundling rhythm.\
  \ Pale poets may skip and prance, and paler poets may gambol \u2018cross verdant\
  \ sward, but generally such pale poetasters have a whiff of the Soppensapp about\
  \ them. I do not make the charge lightly. I would say the same were I standing on\
  \ the beach, at dusk, surrounded by gulls scavenging among the bleached bones of\
  \ Inspip. There are worse ways to end one's day. I have loafed and been bitter,\
  \ sometimes, when recalling those Sappensopp Days, the gleaming lanterns, the flint\
  \ hearts, the barbicans atop the tors. Some come to genuflect and some come to keen,\
  \ and those are their ways, and I shall not gainsay them, or, if I do, I shall crunch\
  \ across their own gravel, on my hands and knees, to prove my point. You will not\
  \ hear such claims from the Inspips of this world, this spinning globe, this dispensation.\n\
  Inspip was at Innsmouth when his horrible book came out, and he was betrayed by\
  \ a clairvoyant. That is often how these things turn out, how tangled skeins unravel.\
  \ The clairvoyant was unbridled, certainly, and mouthy, but that made a welcome\
  \ change. Guttural imprecations and gargling were her mode of speech, if speech\
  \ it can be called, and as soon as he heard what was being said about him the wretched\
  \ Inspip tried to flee. Typical, I may say, of those who observe the Soppensappist\
  \ debaucheries, for debaucheries they are. His fleeing, or rather his failed fleeing,\
  \ took him to places human beings ought better avoid, such as the wild hills and\
  \ the fiercest sea fronts, the most dismal of outcrops and the tinniest of fairground\
  \ arcades. Tinny it was and tacky and awash with tat, and there Inspip was cornered,\
  \ there he was revealed as a pooper whose cronies vanished, pfft!, gone, leaving\
  \ him alone in his poopery. He knew his book was but page after page of meretricious\
  \ squamoogle, yet he pressed on, writing hundreds and hundreds of pages, like a\
  \ Blunkett. I have said elsewhere that he never knew the first thing about the Sappensopp\
  \ Days, not because attempts had not been made, in his childhood, to bash a few\
  \ basic ideas into his curly-haired head, but because he wilfully let all that he\
  \ did once know evaporate, like a type of milk in a tin. It is a mystery why he\
  \ did so, why he allowed the Soppensappists to squish their boggling into him. He\
  \ was packed so tight with it he might have burst.\nThe service Pebblehead does\
  \ in his new book is fourfold, I think. He surprises us with little glimpses of\
  \ his chugging. He is aware that his readers know more than he does about cows and\
  \ birds and Stalinism and cashew nuts, for example, and he does not try to overreach\
  \ himself. (He does overreach himself on the mad clanging of bells in mad bell-towers\
  \ in a mad country, but he does so persuasively, and in spades.) Then there is his\
  \ almost grating acknowledgement of those who allowed him to listen to the tape\
  \ recordings. I confess I fought back tears, and the ducts still shed the odd drop\
  \ now and then as I recollect how fantastic an achievement it was to risk his bones\
  \ in circumstances where you or I would have hidden behind a nest of crates, panting,\
  \ heart hammering thump-a-thump-a-thump-a-thump. And fourthly, critically, he knows\
  \ his bales, and he says so, without apology, without rancour, without coming over\
  \ all twee and mimsy, like an Inspip would have done, had he known a bale from a\
  \ pile of pins and pencils or some other Soppensappist vulgarity.\nWhat we are left\
  \ with is something we can all be proud of, standing on a bridge, in blistering\
  \ sunlight, watching the sparkling river below us flowing relentlessly to a destination\
  \ we can never even imagine reaching, even if night crashes down around our ears\
  \ a thousand times, a thousand thousand times, in this land it would be bonkers\
  \ to disavow. It is on that bridge I stand. I do not think Pebblehead would recognise\
  \ me now, and I know for certain that Inspip, if by some miracle his bones leapt\
  \ up out of the deep and snapped themselves together into human form, and were enfleshed,\
  \ and quick with life, even then Inspip would know me not, for I have read the book,\
  \ and it is as if I were truly there, fluttering and bright, pitched past pitch\
  \ of grandeur in those jugband Sappensopp Days.\n[2007-03-16]"
