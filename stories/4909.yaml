  \ The Second Booke, Chap. 7. Of God in the 1634 English translation by Philomen\
  \ Holland\nOne person who was very familiar with the ancient idea that an egg might\
  \ serve as a childish toy, and that from the egg would hatch a god, was Tiny Enid.\
  \ On the day of her birth she was presented with an egg by her mysterious, unnamed\
  \ mentor, and as soon as she grew old enough for childish play it became her favoured\
  \ toy. It is easy to forget, given the plucky tot's many deeds of heroism and derring-do,\
  \ that she was still but a tot, and, when time allowed, she played as other tots\
  \ do. She played games such as Hide The Egg In The Pantry, Roll The Egg Down A Gentle\
  \ Incline, and Balance The Egg On A Precipice Over A Yawning Chasm.\nIt is not entirely\
  \ clear when Tiny Enid learned that her egg contained an as yet unhatched god. It\
  \ is also perfectly possible that it did not, and that the venturesome little fascist\
  \ simply invented the idea for purposes of self-dramatisation. Either way, we do\
  \ know that one hot summer's day she stopped treating the egg as a plaything, placed\
  \ it in a carton, put the carton on her mantelpiece, and spent many hours watching\
  \ over it, waiting for it to hatch.\nSeveral writers\u2014better to call them hacks\u2014\
  have devoted vast swathes of psychobabble to the suggestion that Tiny Enid was convinced,\
  \ or convinced herself, that by embarking on ever greater feats of infant heroism\
  \ she could somehow persuade the god to crack open its egg and burst forth into\
  \ the world, ushering in a new dispensation under the cope of heaven and, not incidentally,\
  \ installing the tot as its Archangel. In this reading, Tiny Enid is impelled to\
  \ acts and adventures of ever greater recklessness for purely selfish reasons. The\
  \ hacks who peddle this stuff never stop to consider two blindingly obvious facts.\
  \ One, it makes no sense whatsoever, and two, there is no evidence that, at the\
  \ end of each of her adventures, Tiny Enid dashed back to her mantelpiece to check\
  \ on the egg. On the contrary, she was notorious for sticking around to receive\
  \ plaudits and medals and cups and cash prizes and to watch parades pass by in her\
  \ honour, and on occasions when these things did not happen, she would bash a few\
  \ heads together, literally, until she considered due gratitude was displayed. These\
  \ are not the activities of one who hankers for the imminent intervention of the\
  \ divine, whether from an egg or from anywhere else.\nIndeed, a better case could\
  \ be made that a child as self-possessed and drunk on her own reputation as Tiny\
  \ Enid would consider the arrival of a new god as fatally stealing her thunder.\
  \ It is worth asking what sort of god she was expecting to hatch from the egg on\
  \ her mantelpiece. Although she was not a religious girl, it is a matter of record\
  \ that she had, like the Swiss skiing ace Woodcarver Steiner, great ecstasies. During\
  \ these entrancements, did she have visions of her egg-hatched god? It is a great\
  \ pity that she never left us an account of at least one of her great ecstasies\
  \ in her Memoirs. The egg itself is mentioned, over and over again, at first in\
  \ references to its status as a plaything, as here, on page 47:\nI passed many a\
  \ happy hour playing Carry The Egg Towards The Pond and other delightful pastimes\n\
  and then, from page 88 onwards, she constantly reminds us of its numinous presence:\n\
  Before revving up my jalopy to speed to the rescue of the stricken and the maimed\
  \ who had been attacked by the giant lobster being, I paused to look at the egg\
  \ in its carton on the mantelpiece. It had not yet hatched.\nfor example, and\n\
  The next Thursday was a particularly dull day without any opportunity for daring\
  \ rescues of those imperilled. I spent much of my time contemplating the egg in\
  \ its carton on the mantelpiece, from which no god had yet hatched.\nIn her lifetime,\
  \ no god ever did hatch from the egg, but I suppose it is not impossible that one\
  \ might still do so. For though Tiny Enid herself grew old and died, she always\
  \ kept the egg with her wherever she roamed in her long life, and at her death it\
  \ was found among her effects. Carefully catalogued by those who keep her flame\
  \ alive, the egg, in its carton, is now kept in the Tiny Enid Museum, recently established\
  \ in a cavernous hangar on a so-called \u201Crustic industrial estate\u201D on the\
  \ edge of the mephitic marshes on the outskirts of Pointy Town. If you visit, and\
  \ pay through the nose for an entrance ticket, seek out the egg in its refrigerated\
  \ chamber, and who knows?, perhaps while you are there you will see the shell crack,\
  \ and a god hatch out, come blind and trembling into the world.\n[2010-08-02]"
