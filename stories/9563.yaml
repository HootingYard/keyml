text: "Brrrr! Wrap up warm, because it's cold outside! Well, it would be, wouldn't\
  \ it, this being the Ice Age. There have been other Ages\u2014Stone and Iron, for\
  \ example, and Bronze\u2014but this one we have dubbed the Ice Age, because it is\
  \ so chilly. Sitting here next to my oil stove, wearing various furry animal pelts,\
  \ it is easy to forget just how cold it is outside. I can't see through the windows,\
  \ because they are all frosted up, but I suppose if I turned down the volume on\
  \ the cassette player I would be able to hear the howling winds of the blizzard,\
  \ and they would serve to remind me of the cold. But I would rather listen to the\
  \ cassette playing poptones, quite frankly. I am not in the right mood for howling.\n\
  The wind howls, and so do wolves. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish one kind\
  \ of howling from another. Wolves seem to thrive in the chilly chilly weather of\
  \ this Ice Age. They have furry coats of course, or at least hairy, bristly coats,\
  \ au naturelle, as it were. To obtain my furry pelt I have to slaughter apt creatures,\
  \ or at least pay someone to do so for me, to slaughter and skin and stitch. I am\
  \ somewhat weedy, and short-sighted, and I would much rather huddle by the oil stove\
  \ listening to poptones than be out there in the cold, hunting and stalking. In\
  \ any case, I do not have a pair of snow shoes, so I wouldn't get very far. Within\
  \ a few feet of my door I expect I would be up to my waist in snow, and helpless,\
  \ and I would have to make puny cries, in the hope that a tough wolf-hunter would\
  \ come to my rescue.\nAt least you know where you are with wolves. Those rampaging\
  \ wild boars are another matter entirely. Blimey. I have been woken from a nap by\
  \ the sound of them battering their tusks against the walls of my hut. I am pretty\
  \ sure it was a wild boar, covered in hoar frost, that chewed through the wiring\
  \ of my radio set. I thought the wiring was safe, submerged under snow, stretching\
  \ out across the tarputa, but those boars are relentless. Now I can only get some\
  \ of the channels, and none of the music ones, which is why I rely on the cassette\
  \ player.\nIce Age music is pretty grim, all told, but when the alternative is the\
  \ howling of wind and wolves and the bashing of boar-tusks against the walls, you\
  \ have to take what you can get. And it's not all bad. I grew quite fond of Chepstow's\
  \ Icicle Symphony, for example. But the tape was ruined when I left it too close\
  \ to the oil stove, and it partly melted. So now I make do with poptones, icy poptones,\
  \ with lots of synthesizer. At top volume, it drowns out the howling.\nI used to\
  \ have a pair of snow shoes. Of course I did, for how else would I have been able\
  \ to cross the tarputa and make it to my hut? It took me six weeks to get here,\
  \ plodding slowly. I meant to hang on to them, for emergencies, but the fibre they\
  \ were made from was highly flammable, and one evening the oil stove spat out a\
  \ stray spark which ignited them. I acted quickly, putting on a pair of mittens\
  \ and chucking the burning snow shoes out of the door, into a snowdrift. If I hadn't,\
  \ the whole hut would have burned down and I'd have been a goner. But it means that\
  \ now I have to rely on passing wolf-hunters for certain essentials. They can be\
  \ a difficult lot.\nI got so fed up with the rampaging wild boars battering their\
  \ tusks against the walls that I thought I'd fashion some kind of boar-trap. I asked\
  \ one of the wolf-hunters for help. In return for soup, I hoped he would dig a pit\
  \ outside, a few feet away from the door, into which the boars might topple, and\
  \ having toppled, perish. The rascal ate my soup but said he was a wolf-only hunter,\
  \ and couldn't be distracted in his career by digging a pit for boars. He was huge\
  \ and violent, so I didn't argue.\nI may no longer have the Icicle Symphony to listen\
  \ to, but I have plenty of icicles. They hang from the ceiling, in their hundreds,\
  \ and occasionally I pluck one off, to suck, or to use as a little spear. Sometimes\
  \ I will use the same icicle for both spearing and sucking, turn and turn about,\
  \ until my sucking has made it useless for spearing. The icicles are a bit too big\
  \ to use as pins, and funnily enough I have discovered I have absolutely no need\
  \ of pins, here in my hut. I have got along quite well without a single pin. That\
  \ surprised me, but there it is.\nApart from the fiendish cold, the reason I don't\
  \ go out much is fear. Call me namby-pamby, but I am terrified of the twin perils\
  \ of snow-blindness and piblokto. The wolves and the rampaging wild boars I think\
  \ I could handle, using a combination of mesmerism and gibberish, but neither of\
  \ those is of much use where the ruination of one's eyes and one's mind is at stake.\
  \ I have noticed that the wolf-hunters all seem to be equipped with very natty sunglasses,\
  \ which presumably protect them against snow-blindness. Whether they have something\
  \ similar to guard their brains I do not know. They are not a talkative lot. Oh,\
  \ they will gobble down the soup you proffer them, but that's as far as it goes.\n\
  On one of the radio stations I am still able to pick up, I heard the other day that\
  \ the Ice Age might be coming to an end. Some pundit in the studio was wittering\
  \ on about all the snow melting, across the tarputa, for as far as the eye could\
  \ see, revealing a buried landscape, a vista of salt flats. It sounded to me as\
  \ if his vision was little different from the snowbound land of the Ice Age. But\
  \ I suppose if it does get warmer I might go out from time to time, though I am\
  \ not sure to what purpose. I don't put salt in my soup, never have.\n[2012-07-02]"
