text: "One wintertime, in a period when he was watching far too many action films,\
  \ Dobson decided that he wanted to have his own SWAT team, to deploy as the fancy\
  \ took him. Marigold Chew pointed out to the pamphleteer that this latest notion\
  \ of his was particularly demented. She asked him where he expected to billet his\
  \ team, how he proposed to pay them, in what delusional circumstances he might order\
  \ them out on a mission, and, crucially, what resources he had to ensure they were\
  \ given a thorough debriefing, with access if necessary to post-traumatic stress\
  \ disorder counselling. Dobson replied with a series of low grunting noises, before\
  \ clambering into his new oversized Uruguayan fair trade kagoul and crashing out\
  \ into the downpour. The kagoul was second-hand, stained and rent in many places,\
  \ but it was new to Dobson and he thought he cut a dash in it, though of course\
  \ he did not, for Dobson rarely if ever cut a dash, and then only by accident.\n\
  As he trudged along the canal towpath into town, Dobson composed in his fuming brain\
  \ the advertisement he planned to place in the \u201CSituations Vacant\u201D column\
  \ of the Evening Sofa & Last Trump. It duly appeared, remarkably free of misprints,\
  \ a few hours later.\nWanted. SWAT team to carry out engagements on behalf of out\
  \ of print pamphleteer. Some of the missions may be perilous. Applicants should\
  \ be armed to the teeth and preferably dressed from head to foot in black, with\
  \ big black boots and shiny black helmets with visors. You will be able to give\
  \ a full account of the vitality of your pneuma, in the ancient Greek sense of the\
  \ fiery essence in the air, the creative and animating spirit drawn into the body\
  \ through the lungs and generating your innate heat. Benefits include free pamphlets\
  \ and lots of smoking breaks.\nIt did not escape Marigold Chew's notice that the\
  \ advertisement failed to address any of the questions she had raised with Dobson\
  \ earlier. That evening, on the way to a peasant theatre adaptation of Airport Chaplain,\
  \ she tried a different tack.\n\u201CAssuming for a moment that a sufficient tally\
  \ of persons with vibrant pneuma apply to be on your SWAT team, Dobson,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201CWhat sort of missions do you intend to send them on?\u201D\n\u201C\
  SWAT team missions!\u201D replied Dobson, excitedly, as their tram ploughed through\
  \ a puddle of ice, \u201CMissions that will test their valour and grit as well as\
  \ their pneuma!\u201D\nPressed to supply just one tiny example before they arrived\
  \ at the dilapidated barn that had been converted by goateed trust fund gits into\
  \ a \u201Cperformance space\u201D, Dobson suggested that he would deploy his SWAT\
  \ team in the event of a calamitous tram collision resulting in dozens of dead and\
  \ injured tram passengers. Marigold Chew pointed out that as there was but a single\
  \ tram that plied the tram tracks of the town, no such collision could take place.\
  \ Dobson countered that the tram might collide with a bus. Marigold Chew pointed\
  \ out that the timetables and routes of the tram and the bus had been designed with\
  \ just such a calamity in mind, and so clever had the planning been that a collision\
  \ of bus and tram was both theoretically and physically impossible. Dobson thought\
  \ she said \u201Cimplausible\u201D and clutched at that straw for a few seconds\
  \ until corrected. He then aired the idea that the tram might collide with wild\
  \ roaming cows. Marigold Chew was forced to admit that wild roaming cows did sometimes\
  \ roam wildly through the town, and could conceivably roam wildly into the path\
  \ of the oncoming tram. Dobson looked smug. Marigold Chew then landed the killer\
  \ punch by asking Dobson pointedly what his pneuma-inspired SWAT team would do if\
  \ sent to intervene in a scene of smashed-up tram and the tangled and bloody bodies\
  \ of tram passengers and wild roaming cows dead, dying, wounded, scarred, fractured,\
  \ and hysterical. Dobson had not thought beyond the excitement of his SWAT team\
  \ descending on cables from their whirring helicopter, and had no ready reply. But\
  \ at the very moment that he was going to improvise some unconvincing flimflam,\
  \ the tram clanked to a halt next to the dilapidated barn, and the conversation\
  \ was forgotten as both Dobson and Marigold Chew alighted in the snow and rummaged\
  \ in their pippy bags for their Airport Chaplain tickets.\nRemarkably, in the ensuing\
  \ weeks, Dobson received several applications from SWAT team wannabes. It is to\
  \ his credit that he granted each one a lengthy interview, less so that irrespective\
  \ of what they said he rejected them all on the grounds that their pneuma was deficient.\
  \ One hopeful felt crushed by Dobson's decision, called on him armed with documentary\
  \ evidence of absolutely fantastic pneuma, and became belligerent. Marigold Chew\
  \ set the crows on him and he fled. The following spring, he and Dobson passed each\
  \ other in the street. They spat at each other.\n[2007-10-24]"
