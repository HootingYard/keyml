text: "Word of the day\_: Boggle.\nI am afraid that before we move on to boggle, we\
  \ have unfinished business with yesterday's word of the day, parp. Reader Wlad Onanugu\
  \ writes\_:\nDear Wordmaestro, I am confused by your maunderings on the word parp.\
  \ You say it is pretty much identical to toot, but then proceed, in your illustrative\
  \ sentence, to refer to a hooter, rather than, as I might have expected, a tooter\
  \ or parper. My mental chaos is compounded by the fact that you also make mention\
  \ of tots, virtually the same word as toots, though entirely different in meaning.\
  \ I looked forward to improving my word power with your new series. Instead I find\
  \ myself quite dreadfully unhinged.\nMr Onanugu will find it helpful to consult\
  \ Dobson's pamphlet Parp. Toot, Hooter, Tooters, Parpers And Tots\_: A Complete\
  \ Guide For The Bewildered (out of print). I have not read it myself, but am told\
  \ it is almost, but not quite, \u201Cthe greatest pamphlet ever written\u201D.\n\
