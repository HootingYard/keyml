text: "Oi, you lot. This is a plea for money, and for once it is not an unseemly begging\
  \ letter asking you to plop a few groats into the coffers of Mr Key's Fund For Distressed\
  \ Out Of Print Pamphleteers, though of course you can do that too. On this occasion,\
  \ however, honour, duty, and sheer common sense calls you to send money, or indeed\
  \ monies, to the world's finest radio station. Here is what the powers that be at\
  \ ResonanceFM have to say:\nDear Friends of Hooting Yard,\nResonance is currently\
  \ trying to raise money to bolster its imminent application to Arts Council England.\
  \ To this end, the radio station wants to build reserves\u2014savings which indicate\
  \ its financial resilience and which it can draw upon in exceptional circumstances.\n\
  If you enjoy Hooting Yard On The Air, please help us by donating to Resonance today.\
  \ You can do this here on our website, or here via JustGiving.\nAnd if you are a\
  \ UK tax payer you can add value to your donation to our registered charity (number\
  \ 290236) through GiftAid. All it takes is fifty listeners of Hooting Yard donating\
  \ \xA310 each for us to reach this year's target. Please mention Hooting Yard in\
  \ your communication.\nResonance does not own a building, so has few material assets;\
  \ nor does it charge for its service, so it very much relies on the generosity of\
  \ you, its listeners. Please take a moment to show your appreciation of our broadcasts\
  \ and secure the station's future. Thank you!\n[2014-01-09]"
