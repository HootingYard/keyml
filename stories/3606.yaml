text: "\nI must thank my son Ed for drawing to my attention the band Dirty Projectors,\
  \ which appears to be a nominal vehicle for the musical outpourings of one Dave\
  \ Longstreth. (It may well be that some readers are already familiar with them/him,\
  \ but I was not, until this year.) I have been particularly taken with The Getty\
  \ Address. Here is a description of it: \u201D Inspired by Aztec mythology, the\
  \ Eagles, and the 9/11 aftermath, it is a sprawling, layered glitch opera about\
  \ Don Henley, leader of the aforementioned country/soft-rock group, and it was recorded\
  \ over the course of almost two years, in three different states, with more than\
  \ twenty-five people. Dave Longstreth, the principal Dirty Projector, wrote and\
  \ recorded arrangements for wind septet, women's choir, and cello octet, digitally\
  \ deconstructed them, and then sang over the reconstituted parts in order to make\
  \ these songs.\u201D If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, consider this\
  \ further note, from the Wikipedia: \u201CAlthough the lyrics have been described\
  \ as gibberish, the words actually do tell a narrative beginning with Don Henley\
  \ contemplating suicide, and ending with a new installment of Longstreth's songs\
  \ involving brown finches.\u201D I need hardly point out that anybody who writes\
  \ a series of songs \u201Cinvolving brown finches\u201D is almost certainly a genius.\n\
