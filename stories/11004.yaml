text: "Yesterday I came upon two phrases, the one spoken and the other written. I\
  \ overheard a reference to \u201Ca small nice pig\u201D, and I read the words \u201C\
  mysterious East German sausages\u201D. Given that the pig was \u201Cnice\u201D,\
  \ I can only hope that it did not end up as a constituent part of the sausages.\n\
  The contexts of both phrases need not concern us, and in any case I shall soon forget\
  \ them, given the parlous state of my memory. Ideally, I would construct texts around\
  \ both the small nice pig and the mysterious East German sausages, use them as springboards\
  \ for flights of invention, embed them within sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose.\
  \ One day, one day . . .\nFor the time being, rather than scribbling them in a jotting\
  \ pad, I decided to share them with you lot, by giving them a postage of their own,\
  \ which will also act as an aide memoire. You will encounter them both again, of\
  \ that there is little doubt.\n[2013-02-12]"
