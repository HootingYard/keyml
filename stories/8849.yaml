text: "Next month, or the month after, or possibly the month after that, at any rate\
  \ before the year's end, fingers crossed, there will be a rare chance to see the\
  \ early films of the fanatical Teutonic auteur Horst Gack. The Pointy Town Film\
  \ Festival is devoting a fortnight to little-seen but legendary works including\
  \ Lolloping Around A Pond, Prancing Around A Lake, and Mincing Around A Reservoir.\
  \ With their bright, gaudy colour photography, lurching camera movements, and deafening\
  \ soundtracks of oompah band power ballad cover versions, these are the films that\
  \ put Horst Gack on the map. At the time, he was alone on that map, a tiny, isolated\
  \ speck in a vast wilderness, much of which remained blank. It still does, save\
  \ for a few tentative scratches and blots where previously there was an awful void.\n\
  The critic Gilbert Dot contends that \u201CHorst Gack brought to the filmic circumnavigation\
  \ of inland bodies of water a brutal, even murderous, intensity never before seen\
  \ in the cinema, or indeed in the real world\u201D. Certainly there is something\
  \ hallucinatory about these films, which feature some of the great stars of the\
  \ time dressed in costumes designed by some of the great costume designers of the\
  \ time. The director's use of state of the art night-vision technology, developed\
  \ by the military, in bright and battering sunlight, with vaseline smeared on the\
  \ camera lens, only adds to the unprecedented visual feast.\nThe Pointy Town season\
  \ also allows us to track the development of Horst Gack's aesthetic, with the first\
  \ ever screening of the previously presumed lost Gadding Towards A Bog. Here, he\
  \ casts aside the motif of circumnavigation and has his star approach the inland\
  \ body of water\u2014but, importantly, it is an adulterated body of water, a vile\
  \ bog, O vile! vile!, the vilest bog his location scouts were able to find. We,\
  \ the audience, are only granted a glimpse of it, after much gadding, in the final\
  \ nanoseconds of the film. It is a revelation, of a peculiarly Gackesque kind.\n\
  Gilbert Dot, when asked to define the term Gackesque, burst into tears. Pressed\
  \ for an answer, his sobbing and weeping became more convulsive, his breathing grew\
  \ laboured, he shook, he broke out in a cold sweat, he gnashed his false teeth,\
  \ he rent his garments, he palpitated, there was the appearance of a ball in his\
  \ throat, he gave signs of suffocating, his legs gave way, and he collapsed onto\
  \ the street, from where he was scooped up by a passing film buff who cradled him\
  \ in her arms as he lapsed into a coma. I was reminded, tintum tantum, of Bellini's\
  \ Pieta (1472).\n\nI was reminded, too, of Horst Gack's theoretical essay The Collapsed\
  \ Film Critic, a cri de coeur which galvanised a small and indeed negligible band\
  \ of artists, poets, film makers, and chancers when it appeared in the journal Intemperate\
  \ Ravings By Horst Gack. Early in his career, the director had carved out a niche\
  \ for himself from which he could not be dislodged. Was it a blessing or a curse,\
  \ that niche, that resistance to dislodgement?\nThe Pointy Town season will give\
  \ us an opportunity to judge, if we so wish. But there are many cineastes who will\
  \ stay away, in a huff. For them, Horst Gack can never be forgiven for the volte\
  \ face he performed with the release of his middle period extravaganza Can Hieronymus\
  \ Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe And Find True Happiness? Redux, a shot-for-shot\
  \ remake of Anthony Newley's 1969 musical starring Anthony Newley, Connie Kreski,\
  \ Joan Collins, Milton Berle, George Jessel, Patricia Hayes, Stubby Kaye, Victor\
  \ Spinetti and Bruce Forsyth. So close is it to the original that, when the films\
  \ were shown back to back, only one critic out of twenty was able to say which was\
  \ which. Gilbert Dot was that critic, and I would dearly like to ask him how he\
  \ perceived what nineteen others could not, but he remains comatose and cradled\
  \ in the street. Apparently, he is contractually bound to remain in situ, along\
  \ with his cradler, until such time as Horst Gack has flown in and set up his cameras\
  \ and filmed the unconscious critic in extremis. Industry gossip has it that the\
  \ director has embarked on a series of film adaptations of his early critical essays.\
  \ Some will denounce this as self-referential navel-gazing of the worst kind, but\
  \ they are unlikely to say so to Horst Gack's face.\nThat face! It was the subject\
  \ of his next feature after the Newley remake, a four-and-a-half-hour musical entitled\
  \ Horst Gack's Face\_: A Hootenanny. Much of the music was recycled from Hieronymus\
  \ Merkin, adapted for frantic and deranged Appalachian barn dance arrangements.\
  \ The camera lingers on Horst Gack's face, filmed using state of the art night-vision\
  \ technology, developed by the military, in bright and battering sunlight, with\
  \ vaseline smeared on the lens. Several critics, Gilbert Dot among them, have called\
  \ it the most frightening film in the history of cinema. It is perhaps pertinent\
  \ that it was produced by Hammer Studios.\nThere are rumours, so far unconfirmed,\
  \ that Horst Gack himself will attend the Festival for a Q and A session after the\
  \ showing of the final film in the season. This is his foray into what he called\
  \ \u201Ccinematic terrorism\u201D, the notorious, and notoriously lengthy, Hitchcock\
  \ With Eggs. With not a jot of permission from Alfred Hitchcock's estate, in fact\
  \ quite the opposite, Horst Gack joined together into a single film the director's\
  \ entire canon, and inserted an egg into every single scene. Technically brilliant\
  \ and absolutely terrifying, it was condemned, by Gilbert Dot among others, as \u201C\
  pointless, tasteless, and a thumping great insult to the Master of Suspense\u201D\
  . The response of the Hitchcock estate is not suitable for family reading.\nAlthough\
  \ the precise date of the Pointy Town Film Festival is still up in the air, I understand\
  \ that queues are already forming outside the ticket booth in the Pointy Town Zippety\
  \ Doo Dah Dance Hall, Scout Hut & Cinema. Whether those queuing have the faintest\
  \ idea of what they are letting themselves in for is not for me to say.\n[2012-04-05]"
