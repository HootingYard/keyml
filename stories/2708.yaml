text: "\u201CIt was the first time, I realised, that I had ever clearly seen a jazz-band.\
  \ The spectacle was positively frightening\u2026\n\u201COh, those mammy-songs, those\
  \ love-longings, those loud hilarities! How was it possible that human emotions\
  \ intrinsically decent could be so ignobly parodied? I felt like a man who, having\
  \ asked for wine, is offered a brimming bowl of hog-wash. And not even fresh hog-wash.\
  \ Rancid hog-wash, decaying hog-wash. For there was a horrible tang of putrefaction\
  \ in all that music. Those yearnings for Mammy of Mine and My Baby, for Dixie and\
  \ the Land where Skies are Blue and Dreams come True, for Granny and Tennessee and\
  \ You\u2014they were all a necrophily. The Mammy after whom the black young Hebrews\
  \ and the blond young muffin-faces so retchingly yearned was an ancient Gorgonzola\
  \ ; the Baby of their tremulously gargled desire was a leg of mutton after a month\
  \ in warm storage ; Granny had been dead for weeks ; and as for Dixie and Tennessee\
  \ and Dream Land\u2014they were odoriferous with the least artificial of manures.\u201D\
