  \ a fearsome creature I had never previously heard of\u2014the Goliath bird-eating\
  \ spider. Eek! Unfamiliar with this beast, I was able to work out the answer from\
  \ the clue, the ingenious anagram \u201CBig horrid giant's ideal pet\u201D. Wishing\
  \ to know more, I took a trip to the Wikipedia and found that the spider was given\
  \ its name by intrepid Victorian explorers who saw one devouring a hummingbird.\
  \ I am going to have to investigate this more thoroughly, using proper tools, i.e.\
  \ books.\nThe Wikipedia does not explicitly state that the Victorian explorers were\
  \ intrepid, but in my innards I feel sure they were. I can picture them, wearing\
  \ pith helmets, with Bibles stuck in their pockets, stalking through alien terrain.\
  \ Within weeks or months, of course, they would go to pieces in the tropics, as\
  \ so many doughty Empire-builders did before them, but for now, they could watch\
  \ a hummingbird being eaten by a spider and make careful notes in their sweat-stained\
  \ jotting pads.\nHad the crossword appeared yesterday, I would not have been able\
  \ to look up the Goliath bird-eating spider in the Wikipedia, because it shut down\
  \ for twenty-four hours. Though this blackout left many bereft, it did not worry\
  \ me, as I was able to funnel all my enquiries towards the Nigipedia, which I suspect\
  \ will henceforth be my main online source of reference. Indeed, so inspiring do\
  \ I find the Nigipedia that I am toying with the idea of setting up a rival, to\
  \ be called either the Hootingpedia or the Keyipedia. There is a sense in which\
  \ the accumulated material splurged forth here over the past eight years already\
  \ constitutes an encyclopaedic body of knowledge. Try tapping a word or phrase into\
  \ the Hooting Yard Search pane over to your left and there is a distinct possibility\
  \ you will be enlightened, or, if not enlightened, kept swaddled in ignorance. Frustrated\
  \ searchers may wish to let me know of topics not yet covered, and I will do my\
  \ best to add to the databases.\nOne of the other answers in today's crossword was\
  \ Henry Fonda. I then thought of a parallel universe, or alternative past, where\
  \ Jane and Peter's papa had starred in The Incredible Shrinking Man (Jack Arnold,\
  \ 1957) in place of Grant Williams. It was Williams, you will recall, who played\
  \ Scott Carey, the yachting businessman who is engulfed in a mysterious cloud\u2014\
  not unlike M P Shiel's The Purple Cloud\u2014after which he becomes gradually tinier\
  \ and tinier. (There are scenes in the film where his predicament causes him to\
  \ have outbursts of helpless anger, which we could call a Tinie Tempah, but let\
  \ us draw a veil over that thought.) In my imagined version starring Fonda rather\
  \ than Williams, I pictured a terrifying scene where Scott Carey is menaced by a\
  \ Goliath bird-eating spider. Of course, Carey/Fonda is not a bird, but the spider\
  \ might mistake him for one, and come scuttling towards him across a dolls\u2019\
  \ house floor, as the music swells and screeches and we put our hands over our eyes\
  \ and whimper with fear. Come to think of it, there is something a little birdlike\
  \ about Henry Fonda's countenance, from a certain angle, in a certain light, and\
  \ I suspect if one were able for a moment to imagine oneself as a Goliath bird-eating\
  \ spider then a tiny Henry Fonda could present himself as a rather toothsome snack.\n\
  Among the other answers in today's crossword are Oscar (Henry Fonda won two Best\
  \ Actor Oscars, plus a Lifetime Achievement award), Vinegary, Nonsuch, Gnostic,\
  \ Dossier, and Motion, this last in reference to the Lemsip-swigging ex-Poet Laureate.\
  \ If Andrew Motion is reading this, which is unlikely, but possible, I think it\
  \ is about time he took my advice and wrote a poem or two about Goliath bird-eating\
  \ spiders. Let me get him started.\nInstead of my Lemsip I was swigging some cider\n\
  When I was attacked by a bird-eating spider\nIts name was Goliath and it was quite\
  \ hairy\nI am a milksop so I found it scary\n[2012-01-19]"
