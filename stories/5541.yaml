  I\nI was sitting on a bench in a bower on a bright summer's day. It was a Wednesday,\
  \ or possibly a Thursday, in August, in the year after the Kennedy assassination,\
  \ far far away in Dallas, and the air was heady with verbena, and hollyhock. I was\
  \ eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial\
  \ hideousness began oozing from my marmalade and fish-head sandwich, and I swooned.\
  \ When I came to, I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I\
  \ remained unaware of it for the rest of my sordid and sorry life.\nII\nThey called\
  \ him Blomqvist, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above the post\
  \ office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day Blomqvist\
  \ died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no\
  \ doubt that he was dead, for hovering above his chest was a baleful phantom, emitting\
  \ gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial hideousness which it poured\
  \ into a funnel inserted into Blomqvist's right ear. They closed up the room and\
  \ nailed the door shut. It remained unopened for the next hundred years.\nIII\n\
  The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis,\
  \ the bird scientist.\n\u201CLook, there is a bird on the bell tower,\u201D he said\
  \ to his pneumonia-racked assistant Cubbit, who was doing something foolish with\
  \ a pair of bicycle clips.\nJarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look,\
  \ but the spindly youth was distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with\
  \ pots and pans. It was the neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds, and spookily,\
  \ sitting next to him in the passenger seat, was a hideous extraterrestrial being,\
  \ suppurating, greasy and malevolent.\nIV\n\u201CHand me that chaffinch, Cubbit,\u201D\
  \ said Jarvis to his lantern-jawed assistant. Jarvis was a bird scientist, devoted\
  \ to the study of chaffinches. Wandering the hills, he had spotted one. As Cubbit\
  \ picked up the chaffinch, he heard a scream. Spinning round, he saw Jarvis being\
  \ engulfed by a gruesome suppurating monster. The poor lad scampered back to the\
  \ lab and told what had happened to Mrs Purgative.\n\u201CWell! I never heard of\
  \ such a thing!\u201D she exclaimed. She hoisted her mop on her shoulder, took Cubbit\
  \ by his withered hand, and led him far away, all the way to Gondwanaland.\n[2010-11-08]"
