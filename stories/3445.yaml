text: "There are times when one leaps out of bed and feels impelled to gather thirty-nine\
  \ pals or passers-by together to execute a faultless rendition of Spem in alium\
  \ by Thomas Tallis. To assist in this enterprise, here are the words, from the Sarum\
  \ Rite:\nSpem in alium numquam habui praeter in te Deus Israel qui irasceris et\
  \ propitius eris\_et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione dimittis. Domine Deus,\
  \ Creator coeli et terrae respice humilitatem nostram.\nEnglished, thus:\nI have\
  \ never put my hope in any other but in you, O God of Israel, who can show both\
  \ anger and graciousness, and who absolves all the sins of suffering man. Lord God,\
  \ Creator of Heaven and Earth, be mindful of our lowliness.\nHowever mindful we\
  \ are of our lowliness, it may be that in our post-Christian, diverse and vibrant\
  \ community hubs, trendy groovers will want to sing a more inclusive version suitable\
  \ for all faiths and none. To wit:\nSpem in alium numquam habui praeter in te Dobsonius\
  \ Tractator qui irasceris et propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione\
  \ dimittis. O Dobsonius, Creator tractati superbus respice humilitatem nostram.\n\
