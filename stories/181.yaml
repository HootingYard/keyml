text: "What better way to spend a wet Bank Holiday afternoon than to curl up in front\
  \ of the television to watch a trilogy of films by one of the great unsung auteurs\
  \ of the silent screen? The cable channel UK Golden Pap is to be congratulated for\
  \ screening the masterworks of the great\u2014and greatly misunderstood\u2014Pabstus\
  \ Tack. When Tack's films are mentioned, which is rarely, they are dismissed as\
  \ fey, twee confections for children, in an age when childhood was seen as a time\
  \ of purity and innocence. Thus the damning rebuke of a cravat-wearing, pipe-smoking,\
  \ goatee-bearded critic like Jean-Luc Boff, who wrote: \u201CWith these insipid\
  \ pieces of froth, Tack not only drains his films of sound and colour, but also\
  \ of plot, tension, engagement, disturbance, of life and death and sex.\u201D\n\
  What Boff says is true, yet he fails to understand just how radical an approach\
  \ Tack took. Yes, these films are indeed fey and twee, yet at the same time they\
  \ are cloying and saccharine, miraculously inoffensive, whimsical in the most nauseating\
  \ sense of the word.\nThe first in the trilogy is Pippi The Pony Goes To The Paddling\
  \ Pool. The part of Pippi was played by Tack's own pony, Poopy, a placid, well-groomed\
  \ little darling with gossamer ribbons flowing from its mane. In silent black and\
  \ white, we watch as Pippi canters towards a paddling pool and splashes about, gently\
  \ and charmingly. There are no fancy camera angles, no clever-clever montage. \u201C\
  Look,\u201D Tack is saying, \u201CA pony in a paddling pool.\u201D\nHe followed\
  \ this up with Biffy The Africanised Killer Bee Joins A Swarm. In this, possibly\
  \ the finest of the three films, Biffy\u2014played by Tack's pet Africanised killer\
  \ bee, Letitia\u2014is shown buzzing around a municipal flowerbed, then going off\
  \ to join a swarm of her fellows. Tack's camera is static except at the very end,\
  \ where it pans to show Biffy's journey from solitude to companionship.\nThe last\
  \ film is the one where Tack takes the greatest risk with his creative vision. With\
  \ Schmoopy The Vampire Bat Sucks The Life-Blood From A Consumptive Orphan the task\
  \ of retaining a quintessentially Tackesque tweeness must at times have seemed impossible.\
  \ But once again, the auteur in Tack pulls it off, in a magnificently sugar-coated\
  \ fairy cake of a film. Schmoopy, by the way, was played by Tack's own vampire bat,\
  \ Flopsy, while the part of the consumptive orphan went to a doe-eyed\u2014and consumptive\u2014\
  orphan the director found swooning and crumpled, clutching weakly at the railings\
  \ of Pang Hill Orphanage during a blizzard.\nIf there is a better way to spend eleven\
  \ hours on a wet Bank Holiday than watching these films, I for one am at a loss\
  \ to think what it might be.\n[2007-05-28]"
