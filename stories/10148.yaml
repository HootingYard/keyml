text: "The left lung of the tyrant collapsed on the morning of the fourth. At midday,\
  \ a satrap in gorgeous uniform sparkling with embedded gems appeared on the balcony\
  \ to make an announcement. It was imperative, he said, reading from a hastily drafted\
  \ statement, that tyrannical human pneumatics become the proper study of every citizen.\
  \ By the evening, fat textbooks had been printed and bound and consignments ferried\
  \ to every city and town and village and hamlet in the land.\nSo rapid was the response\
  \ of the satraps that the textbooks were not proofread. A number of errors, many\
  \ trivial but some calamitous, were thus allowed to stand. But the book bore the\
  \ tyrant's imprimatur and could not be questioned. As a result, every citizen gained\
  \ a flawed understanding of tyrannical human pneumatics.\nThe tyrant, meanwhile,\
  \ had been placed inside a nylon tent. A wheezing pump imitated the action of a\
  \ working tyrannical human lung. The pump was operated by hand, in case of a loss\
  \ of electrical power caused by the evil machinations of revolutionary scum. Pumpers\
  \ were drawn from lists maintained by one of the satraps. They worked one hour shifts,\
  \ and during their rest periods were penned in an anteroom.\nBy the morning of the\
  \ fifth, embroidered lapel accoutrements bearing a three-coloured image of the collapsed\
  \ tyrannical lung had been issued to all citizens, to be displayed on their outer\
  \ tunics. In certain hotbeds, several persons were shot for failure to wear them.\
  \ After execution, the left lungs were torn out of the corpses and hung on gibbets\
  \ in the town squares. This had a salutary effect on the populace, even in the hotbeds.\n\
  The first public examination on tyrannical human pneumatics took place at midday\
  \ on the fifth in the remote town of Sand. It was conducted orally, and tape recorded.\
  \ Those gaining top marks were taken by sealed train to the capital. A gang of revolutionaries\
  \ attempted a derailment of the train on the outskirts of Gorse. Brave conduct by\
  \ the train conductor, and foolish felled log deployment by the scum, brought their\
  \ nefarious schemes to nought. They were hanged in a barn and their left lungs torn\
  \ from their corpses and burned on a bonfire by the loyal peasants of Gorse.\nThe\
  \ tyrant was told of the narrowly averted derailment. He was as yet unable to speak,\
  \ but he blinked significantly. The blinks were interpreted and converted into text\
  \ by a satrap. Plans to have the text declaimed from the balcony were put on hold.\
  \ It was considered best to wait until after the next day, the sixth, which was\
  \ Flag Day.\nOn arrival in the capital, the top scoring tyrannical human pneumatics\
  \ examinees were taken from the sealed train in sealed trams to the National Archives.\
  \ Here they stood behind glass to watch as the tape recordings of the examinations\
  \ were placed on the register and locked in a special bomb-proof cabinet. They were\
  \ then given a snack in the canteen.\nLate in the afternoon of the fifth, Grimes\
  \ \u201Cthe Wolfman\u201D, leader of the revolutionaries, was arrested in a jungle\
  \ clearing. He was spirited to the capital by way of the subterranean pulley-car\
  \ system. Intelligence reports hinted that he had unparalleled expertise in human\
  \ pneumatics, a field closely related to tyrannical human pneumatics. Bound in chains,\
  \ he was taken to a sealed room in the palace, to where the examinees from Sand\
  \ were also brought once they had digested their snacks in the National Archives\
  \ canteen.\nThe sixth was Flag Day. The weather was such that artificial winds were\
  \ needed to make the flags and standards and pennants billow. Further pumpers had\
  \ to be recruited from the satrap's list to ensure sufficient numbers for both the\
  \ tyrant's lung pump and the artificial wind contraptions. For a while it was touch\
  \ and go, until a keen-eyed under-satrap found a supplementary list which had been\
  \ misfiled in a filing cabinet. He was given a medal, a gorgeous disc of brass embedded\
  \ with gems that sparkled in the sunshine.\nGrimes \u201Cthe Wolfman\u201D was undergoing\
  \ a tormented moral struggle between his revolutionary principles and his professional\
  \ pride as an expert in human pneumatics. The examinees from Sand stood gazing at\
  \ him with the imploring moon-eyes of calves. Some let tears roll slowly down their\
  \ cheeks, but did not overdo the sobbing lest Grimes thought they were making use\
  \ of freshly chopped onions behind his back. Behind a panel, certain satraps discussed\
  \ the pros and cons of an amnesty for Grimes. It was a heated discussion.\nOn the\
  \ morning of the seventh a puncture in the left lung of the tyrant was repaired\
  \ and the lung was reinflated. He was fed from a bowl of slops. Several satraps\
  \ were executed and their left lungs torn out and kicked through the broad boulevards\
  \ of the capital by cheering citizens. Grimes shaved off his beard and was given\
  \ a satrapage and a gorgeous uniform sparkling with embedded gems. A fleet of aeroplanes\
  \ sprayed the jungle with defoliant. The area was then covered with cement as far\
  \ as the eye could see. The examinees from Sand were appointed as tyrannical human\
  \ pneumatics emergency pumping supervisors and given vouchers and bungalows. A second\
  \ edition of the fat textbook was issued, with corrections. The tyrant appeared\
  \ on the balcony, propped up by a concealed prop, and waved to the teeming masses.\n\
  On the morning of the eighth, the right lung of the tyrant collapsed.\n[2012-09-16]"
