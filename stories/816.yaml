text: "On the Guardian's online books pages the other day there was a piece asking\
  \ Which are the best books that never existed? I am grateful to the eagle-eyed Hooting\
  \ Yard reader who alerted me to the fact that someone going by the name of \u201C\
  boiledonions\u201D nominated How To Knit Knots While Remaining Invisible To Hurrying\
  \ Brutes by Dobson. Much as I applaud the wisdom of the choice, I feel I should\
  \ point out that this is, of course, a pamphlet rather than a book, and an out of\
  \ print one to boot. I should also express my dismay that \u201Cboiledonions\u201D\
  \ seems to be claiming that it does not exist.\nThose cavils aside, there is a wider\
  \ point here, and one all readers should note, and note well, in your little Daily\
  \ Hooting Yard Devotional Observations notebooks, and it is this: Dobson may be\
  \ a figure of the last century, and he may be out of print, but wherever and whenever\
  \ you can, as you roam the highways and byways of the interweb, you should take\
  \ whatever opportunities as present themselves to sing his praises, and to make\
  \ his work more widely known.\nSo well done, \u201Cboiledonions\u201D. You may even\
  \ have won a prize.\n[2008-10-22]"
