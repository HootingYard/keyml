text: "There is an old countryside saying, \u201CAs ye reap, so shall ye sow / Especially\
  \ in Fingringhoe\u201D. Now, I have never been to Fingringhoe, not even to explore\
  \ its salt marshes, and I cannot attest to the truth or otherwise of that piece\
  \ of rustic wisdom. All I will say, for the time being, pending an excursion to\
  \ the salt marshes, and perhaps to the village itself, is that the saying seems\
  \ on the face of it to turn standard agricultural practice on its head. Surely,\
  \ before we reap, we must sow? And, bearing in mind the startling efficiencies of\
  \ crop rotation, it is not necessarily the case that we must sow what we have just\
  \ reaped. We can sow something else. As another countryside saying has it, \u201C\
  Where once I had cauliflowers, now I have peas / \_In that field beyond the trees\u201D\
  , although that may not actually be a bit of rustic lore. I may have just made it\
  \ up, whimsically, to no apparent purpose. That is one of the quandaries one faces,\
  \ when striding around the salt marshes and encountering a peasant given to intoning\
  \ countryside sayings. You can never be sure whether he is repeating something that\
  \ has stood him and his ancestors in good stead for generation unto generation,\
  \ from before even Fingringhoe appeared on the map, gosh even from before there\
  \ were any maps to speak of, or whether he is just babbling inconsequentialities\
  \ due to ergot poisoning or simple mischief. Would that there were some kind of\
  \ test one could carry out, to ascertain whether what one was listening to was genuine\
  \ rustic wisdom or no! Perhaps, if I made that excursion to Fingringhoe, and to\
  \ its salt marshes, and put up in a boarding house, and stayed there for years and\
  \ years, and kept my eyes and ears keenly alert, from dawn to dusk, I might be in\
  \ a position to sort hard-won truth from hare-brained twaddle. Meanwhile, I can\
  \ gaze at an old photograph of the village, in case it holds any clues. I suspect\
  \ it does not.\n\n[2010-09-09]"
