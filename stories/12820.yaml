text: "Word of the day\_: Parp.\nParp is a verb, pretty much identical to toot. Here\
  \ is an illustrative sentence: In an apoplexy of rage, he parped his hooter. To\
  \ act out this sentence, for example in a classroom full of tots, you will need\
  \ a hooter. You should also smear your face with beetroot juice to give it that\
  \ \u201Cpurple with rage\u201D look, and be able to boggle your eyes convincingly.\
  \ Tomorrow we will consider the word Boggle.\n[2014-07-23]"
