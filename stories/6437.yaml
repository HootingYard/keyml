  a Diogenesian recluse\u201D are two that spring to mind\u2014but the one I particularly\
  \ treasure is \u201Cthe anti-Capitalist Music journalist\u201D. Alas, the tiny speck\
  \ of Interwebshire where these words appeared has vanished. Let us hope it pops\
  \ up again somewhere one day.\nCapitalist Music were an endearingly preposterous\
  \ band, based in Norwich, in those heady post-punk days circa 1979\u20131982. Their\
  \ chief characteristic, as I recall, was an almost boundless self-importance. For\
  \ the crime of having given them a so-so review in a local rag, I earned my immortal\
  \ epithet. Not \u201Can\u201D anti-Capitalist Music journalist, note, but \u201C\
  the\u201D (as if they were otherwise universally adored), and the implication that\
  \ my opinion of them was the defining fact about me. I may have been scribbling\
  \ reviews of other bands, and of films, and bashing out a cartoon strip, but what\
  \ did that matter? Surely everybody knew me as \u201Cthe anti-Capitalist Music journalist\u201D\
  .\nBut was I, truly? After all, here I am writing about them thirty years later.\
  \ The reason for doing so is basically a plea for help. For me, the band's finest\
  \ work was the ludicrous \u201CJane's Gone To France\u201D, with its rousing lines\
  \ \u201CIt's the land of cheese and wine / It's the land of Marshal Petain!\u201D\
  \ Yet no matter how efficiently I sluice out my ears with Dr Baxter's Ear-Sluicing\
  \ Preparation, I have never, ever been able to work out what on earth the great\
  \ Steve Bloch is singing in the next line. So in a desperate attempt to solve this\
  \ puzzle that has haunted me for three long decades, I am posting the song here.\
  \ Have a listen, and when you have calmed down sufficiently, and stopped giggling,\
  \ do let me know what you think that line is.\nJane's gone to France\nIt's the land\
  \ of cheese and wine\nAnd it's the land of Marshal Petain\nAnd it's the land of\
  \ [what, for God's sake?]\nShe was a good girl\nBut now she's gone for good\nCapitalist\
