  \ told us about the squirrel, the one squirrel which has appeared on the island;\
  \ and it slept under her neck and tried to collect food there. As the relationship\
  \ between artist and squirrel developed, the squirrel came to expect a game at four\
  \ o\u2019 clock in the morning. Tove Jansson had to get out of bed and pretend to\
  \ be a tree. The squirrel would run up and down her frozen limbs.\nOswell Blakeston,\
