  \ what to do with the servants):\nPIG-FRY\u2014This is a Collop Monday dish, and\
  \ is a necessary appendage to \u201Ccracklings\u201D. It consists of the fattest\
  \ parts of the entrails of the pig, broiled in an oven. Numerous herbs, spices,\
  \ &c. are added to it ; and upon the whole, it is a more sightly \u201Ccourse\u201D\
  \ at table than fat cracklings. Sometimes the good wife indulges her house with\
  \ a pancake, as an assurance that she has not forgotten to provide for Shrove Tuesday.\
  \ The servants are also treated with \u201Ca drop of something good\u201D on this\
  \ occasion; and are allowed (if they have nothing of importance to require their\
  \ immediate attention) to spend the afternoon in conviviality.\nfrom The Mirror\
