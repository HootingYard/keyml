text: "It was just as well that the Lemane plan had been abandoned, as Richard Bradley's\
  \ efforts to buy the island for the crown had descended into farce. Stopping to\
  \ purchase some goods to take upriver as \u2018dashes\u2019\u2014that is, gifts\
  \ or bribes\u2014he had been blackmailed by a local trader into buying far more\
  \ merchandise than he had intended. Then he had been made to pay a large number\
  \ of \u2018barrs\u2019, or small iron bars worth five shillings each, to local figures.\
  \ Bradley paid barrs not only to such dignitaries as the \u2018King of Barra\u2019\
  \ and the \u2018master of Gillifree\u2019 but to two \u2018Key Keepers\u2019, the\
  \ \u2018Tobabmanser of Jancacunda\u2019 and to the latter's retinue of fifty servants.\
  \ The Tobabmanser was unable to conduct any negotiations without his \u2018singing\
  \ Man\u2019 (who also required payment in barrs of course), and when the \u2018\
  King of Lemain\u2019 arrived he also brought a large retinue of servants, including\
  \ the requisite key keeper, singing man and principal marabout. The whole negotiations\
  \ cost much more than Bradley had anticipated, and during the palaver, wilting in\
  \ the West African rainforest, he sickened and died. Later, his brother Henry would\
  \ proudly announce to Sydney that the island had been purchased, only to discover\
  \ that he had laboured in vain as the government had abandoned the plan.\nfrom Emma\
