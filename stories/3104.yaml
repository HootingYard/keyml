text: "Time to catch up with some of the expected fallout from last Thursday's Impugned\
  \ By A Peasant. Over at Think Of England, Brit provided a link to what he called\
  \ \_\u201Ca terrifying tale\u201D, prompting this response from Peter Burnet:\n\
  Bah! Bloody Euros! No wonder you're in terminal decline. You get impugned by a peasant\
  \ and you go all artsy-fartsy and spin it into an meandering tale of cravats, bouffants\
  \ and existential turmoil. Want to know how we in the New World handle that kind\
  \ of stuff? Just check out the economical prologue to Dan Brown's new novel:\n\u201C\
  I was once impugned by a peasant, so I shot him. It haunted me until dinnertime.\u201D\
  \nMeanwhile, at the weekend, I had a dream in which I was impugned by a sort of\
  \ seaside variety of peasant. I was sitting in a dockside cafeteria, drinking coffee\
  \ with a couple of friends I have not actually seen for a decade or so. We watched\
  \ as various animals disembarked from a steamship. I pointed to one, and said excitedly:\n\
  \u201CLook, half a cow with no head!\u201D\nThat is indeed what I saw. Sitting alongside\
  \ us in the cafeteria was a bunch of seaside-type peasants, one of whom chortled\
  \ and shouted:\n\u201CIt's a big chicken, you fool!\u201D\nThus was I impugned,\
  \ in my dream.\n[2009-09-15]"
