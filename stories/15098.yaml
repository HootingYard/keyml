text: "By popular demand, here is another verse by a sulky Bulgarian poet, written\
  \ circa 1982. This one is entitled O, Little Radish and purports to be by Fratsin\
  \ K Yecebit. (My poets\u2019 names sound Turkish rather than Bulgarian, but I was\
  \ young, so young \u2026)\nTomorrow morning we will\n  Drink vinegar\n  Here in\
  \ this trench.\n  I haven't paid\n  Any of my debts\n  And I don't intend to.\n\
  \  They can brandish guns at me\n  Or twigs.\n  I'll make my peace\n  And whip it\
  \ up with a whisk.\n  Send me your cash now.\n  Send me the lot.\n  I'm the man\
  \ you ought to\n  Shove in the vat.\n[2017-01-02]"
