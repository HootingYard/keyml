text: "\u201CThen next, take canal life as a form of \u2018university\u2019 education.\
  \ Your present system of education is to get a rascal of an architect to order a\
  \ rascal of a clerk-of-the-works to order a parcel of rascally bricklayers to build\
  \ you a bestially stupid building in the middle of the town, poisoned with gas,\
  \ and with an iron floor which will drop you all through it some frosty evening;\
  \ wherein you will bring a puppet of a cockney lecturer in a dress coat and a white\
  \ tie, to tell you smugly there's no God, and how many messes he can make of a lump\
  \ of sugar. Much the better you are for all that, when you get home again, aren't\
  \ you?\u201D\nJohn Ruskin, Fors Clavigera, Letter LXXV \u201CStar Law\u201D (1877)\n\
