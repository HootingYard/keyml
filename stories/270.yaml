text: "It is twenty years since \u201CHooting Yard\u201D first appeared in print.\
  \ The words were tucked away in a squib of verse included in the 100-page pamphlet\
  \ Smooching With Istvan, half of which was written by Mr Key and half by the estimable\
  \ Max D\xE9charn\xE9. Alas, like the complete oeuvre of Dobson, this Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press publication is now decisively out of print.\nOn page 96, we find the squib\
  \ in question, entitled \u201CSlab's Song\u201D, the first verse of which is:\n\
  The man with the hammers is Traitor Bill\nHis flag is made of shoes\nHe shut up\
  \ shop in Hooting Yard\nAnd drowned himself in booze\nThis was actually written\
  \ a few years before 1987, but I can't recall when that might have been with any\
  \ precision.\n[2007-10-28]"
