text: "I very rarely engage in social or political comment at Hooting Yard, partly\
  \ because that is not what you lot come here for and partly because there are teeming\
  \ thousands of other bloggers, of all shades of opinion, who engage in that sort\
  \ of thing. On occasion, however, I am minded to comment on current affairs, and\
  \ readers can always ignore this postage if they so wish.\nYesterday a bunch of\
  \ \u201Canti-capitalists\u201D took to the West End of London to protest. I noted\
  \ that anti-capitalists always seem to be armed with the latest mobile phones\u2014\
  I don't have one myself, so I must be more anti-capitalist than them\u2014and are\
  \ generally well-fed and clothed. But let that pass. What struck me was a placard\
  \ wielded by one of the protesters, which read \u201CMake Excessive Wealth History\u201D\
  . (Clearly a play on the \u201CMake Poverty History\u201D campaign of a few years\
  \ ago.)\nNow let me first of all point out that I am as poor as a church mouse,\
  \ and scrape by on very little. So I am in no way personally threatened by the sorts\
  \ of people who wish to end excessive wealth. At the same time, I would echo the\
  \ Prince of Darkness, Peter Mandelson, in saying that I am \u201Cintensely comfortable\
  \ with people getting filthy rich\u201D. Being uncomfortable about it is a bit like\
  \ being uncomfortable about the air, or the motion of the planets. Throughout history,\
  \ in all times and all places, some people have been filthy rich compared to the\
  \ mass of others.\nIt is worth stressing the comparative. A tenth century king was\
  \ much, much wealthier than any of his wretched subjects, but, in the western world\
  \ at least, the poorest sod today is materially richer and more comfortable than\
  \ that king. (That this state of affairs is due to capitalism need not detain us.)\n\
  Apart from the sheer inevitability of excessive wealth, it makes little difference\
  \ to me, in terms of my daily life, that there are a few people out there in possession\
  \ of billions. If all that money was taken away from them, would my life be happier?\
  \ And it is precisely the \u201Ctaking away\u201D that I find myself wondering about.\n\
  That person with his placard\u2014how does he envisage making excessive wealth history?\
  \ First, he has to draw a line to define \u201Cexcessive\u201D. Presumably, any\
  \ wealth above that line has to be confiscated, presumably by the government. Ideally,\
  \ I suppose, this government would be run by enlightened persons such as our protester,\
  \ and they would spend the money on things they thought fit. But a different government\
  \ would spend it differently, in ways that our protester might not approve of. So\
  \ there's a snag, unless of course the protester and his enlightened pals could\
  \ remain in government in perpetuity. That might make elections problematic.\nThere\
  \ is also the point about who these excessively wealthy people are. The favoured\
  \ targets are of course bankers and fatcats and plutocrats, hedge fund managers\
  \ and oligarchs, a sort of amorphous mass of fiends who we can picture cackling\
  \ evilly as they grind the faces of the poor into the dirt. What about excessively\
  \ wealthy pop stars and film stars and footballers? (I was amused to learn that\
  \ right on excessively wealthy people such as Sean Penn put in an appearance at\
  \ the Occupy protests to show solidarity, parking their cars a few blocks away and\
  \ arriving at the scene after a short ride on public transport.)\nTo take a single\
  \ example. God knows how rich J K Rowling is. But this is a woman who has earned\
  \ every penny, from the days when she was on the dole and sat in caf\xE9s writing\
  \ her first book. No inherited wealth, no family connections, no evil cackling.\
  \ She gives the impression of being as right on as the protesters and Sean Penn.\
  \ Is it \u201Cfair\u201D to say to her, \u201CI'm sorry, your wealth exceeds the\
  \ precise amount we have deemed acceptable, so we are taking it away from you\u201D\
  ?\nI do wish the iPhone-wielding \u201Canti-capitalists\u201D would think more clearly\
  \ about their proposals. Or maybe they are just self-evidently right, and we should\
  \ bow down to their superior morals?\n[2013-06-12]"
