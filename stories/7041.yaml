text: "[Thomas Carlyle's] aversion for the \u2018fixed smile\u2019 of Greek statuary\
  \ was equal to that of Ruskin, and his way of expressing it no less individual.\
  \ Carlyle sat to G F Watts for his portrait, and Watts, as he often did in conversation\
  \ with his sitters, began to talk of Pheidias. Carlyle advanced a criticism which\
  \ no one else seems to have thought of. He contended that among all the sculptured\
  \ beings which the genius of Pheidias had produced there was \u2018not one clever\
  \ man\u2019. With the long upper lip of Ecclefechan obstinately tightened he declared\
  \ that a short upper lip showed an absence of intellect. He stuck to his point even\
  \ when Watts cited Napoleon, Byron, and Goethe as evidence against him. He added\
  \ that the jaw of the Greek was not sufficiently prominent. \u2018Depend upon it,\u2019\
  \ said Carlyle, \u2018neither God nor man can get on without a jaw.\u2019 \u2018\
  There's not a clever man amongst them all,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018and I would\
  \ away with them\u2014into space.\u2019\nfrom William Gaunt, Victorian Olympus (1952)\n\
