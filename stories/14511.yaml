text: "The Oxford University Press recently published Volume VIII of its majestic\
  \ Collected Works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. The latest book\u2014a snip at \xA3\
  110\u2014is devoted to the Diaries, Journals, and Notebooks. As a good Catholic,\
  \ Hopkins kept a record of the sins he committed, and this new edition includes\
  \ the previously suppressed details. We learn, for example, of frequent bouts of\
  \ \u201DO.H.\u201D (\u201Cold habits\u201D\u2014I think we can guess what that means)\
  \ and of occasions when unseemly thoughts are prompted by the sight of choristers,\
  \ \u201Ccart-boys\u201D, and other young men.\nBut several other entries are suggestive\
  \ of the fathomless depths of the poet's sickening depravity and moral turpitude.\
  \ He confesses in the privacy of his diary to \u201Clooking at and thinking of stallions\u201D\
  \ and worse, much worse, \u201Cself-indulgence at Croydon in fruit\u201D.\nHow Hopkins\
  \ escaped prison is one of the enduring mysteries of Victorian Jesuit literature.\n\
