text: "Last week we looked at self-tidying swans, and we can now extend our ornithological\
  \ researches courtesy of Johnny Seven. Mr Seven, incidentally, is a man to whom\
  \ you should be profoundly thankful. Not only does he present the excellent \u201C\
  Pull The Plug\u201D show on ResonanceFM, but he is currently the sound engineer\
  \ charged with making sure Mr Key's dulcet tones are transmitted into your ears\
  \ every week.\nLong, long ago, in the last century, Johnny snapped a gang of self-tidying\
  \ seagulls. He writes: \u201CTaken on Tuesday 10th December 1984 (I know this since\
  \ it's written on the back of the photographs), I was interested in the slate-grey\
  \ blanket of fog shrouding the trees on the embankment in Putney. No sooner had\
  \ I set up the tripod than the hungry birds came (picture no.1). See their expectant\
  \ little faces. Imagine their disappointment when croutons were not scattered. I\
  \ moved further back to get a wider (and, to be honest, less pleasingly composed)\
  \ view, and the gulls moved further up the railing toward me, increasing in number\
  \ (picture no.2, and detail).\u201D\n\n\n\nYou will note that, unlike the self-tidying\
  \ swans, these self-tidying gulls are not accompanied by an equal number of water\
  \ gulls. This is due to their choice of emperchment, upon railings, if, indeed,\
  \ it was a conscious choice. Who can say what weird shenanigans occur in the tiny\
  \ brains of birds? One thing we can be sure of is that they know how to line up\
  \ very neatly, with the precision for which self-tidying gulls are applauded, in\
  \ some circles.\n[2010-11-10]"
