  I've half a dozen weasels in my sack,\nThree for Jill and three for Jack.\n  Are\
  \ you sure they're weasels and not stoats?\n  Or even little baby goats?\nNo, they're\
  \ weasels, of that I'm sure\nNow get in the barn and lock the door.\n  And Old Farmer\
  \ Frack burns the barn to the ground\n  And swings his sack o\u2019 weasels round\
  \ and round\n  Then he climbs up to the top of Polkadot Hill\n  And gives the sack\
  \ o\u2019 weasels to Jack and Jill\nOh thank you, thank you, Old Farmer Frack!\n\
  We've always wanted weasels in a sack!\n[2018-04-06]"
