  forwards this intriguing email he received:

  josiah diesel, hitch afire flagging josiah rubric sac. anion horehound hitch sac
  walden tint? scotch, tactile ardency. samoa ardency.

  Alasdair thinks this is spam, but I am not so sure. I think the sender is trying
  to tell him something, of great import, of world-shuddering significance.
