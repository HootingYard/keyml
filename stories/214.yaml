text: "A generation ago, the aeroplane pilot and sage Numan asked \u201CAre friends\
  \ electric?\u201D It was pertinent then, and is perhaps more so now. Over the years,\
  \ many thinkers have grappled with Numan's question, but it is fair to say that\
  \ none has been able to give a satisfactory answer. Much publicity was generated\
  \ when Pilbrow published his big fat Symposium on the problem. The garlanded laureate\
  \ of pseudo-sci fi hermeneutic psychobabble persuaded over a hundred movers, shakers,\
  \ and hysterics to respond to the poser put by Numan, and then toured the radio\
  \ and television studios giving inaccurate summaries of their replies. Few who saw\
  \ it will forget the Newsnight appearance when Pilbrow's pretensions were comprehensively\
  \ demolished by weatherman Daniel Corbett, who strode across the set from his meteorological\
  \ map and literally tore a copy of the Symposium to shreds before Pilbrow's\u2014\
  and Jeremy Paxman's\u2014eyes. It was a cheaply-produced paperback edition of the\
  \ book, with weakly-glued binding, but Corbett's feat was no less impressive for\
  \ that.\nSince that watershed, there have been other, muted responses to Numan,\
  \ appearing for the most part tucked away in little-read specialist journals or\
  \ inserted at the tail-end of lectures delivered in draughty, half-empty civic halls\
  \ in the depths of winter. The question remains cogent. The responses have, almost\
  \ invariably, shirked its implicit challenge.\nUntil now. For last week, Blodgett\
  \ commandeered space in all the major newspapers to announce his answer. \u201C\
  Are friends electric? No!\u201D it read, in big bold letters, and then, in smaller\
  \ type, continued \u201CNot my friends, at any rate. My friends are made of gas.\u201D\
  \nBlodgett went on to describe the small band of his pals who appear to him in the\
  \ form of clouds of luminous, and sometimes volatile, gas. Anticipating the charge\
  \ that he is subject to hallucinations, he refutes it with aplomb. Blodgett's gas\
  \ friends shimmer around him, he says, ethereal, mercurial, and insubstantial, but\
  \ boon companions still. He gives the example of his friend Abu Qatooba, a friend\
  \ composed of particularly volatile gas, an Islamic fundamentalist gas-form forever\
  \ railing against the iniquities of pretty much everything he disagrees with and\
  \ threatening to behead sinners and apostates and infidels. Blodgett is himself\
  \ an infidel, of course, and this has led some critics to claim that he is making\
  \ up all this stuff about a gang of friends made out of gas who hover around him.\
  \ He is keen to dispel the impression that his chums are ghosts or wraiths. \u201C\
  They are as real as you or I,\u201D he writes, \u201CCompletely human, with human\
  \ virtues and vices. But they are formed of gas clouds. Abu Qatooba and I disagree\
  \ on many points, but I count him as my friend because I admire his striking beard,\
  \ also of course made out of gas, and his amusing tendency to fly off the handle\
  \ at tiny provocations.\u201D\nBlodgett gives fewer details of his other gas-pals,\
  \ although he finds room to mention Daisy Blunkett, a blind widow-woman with a gas\
  \ guide dog, and Anhopetep, an ancient Egyptian gas pharaoh. He explains that when\
  \ they are not by his side, his friends flit from place to place, sometimes together\
  \ in a gang and sometimes apart, and try to strike up friendships with others. They\
  \ have met with little success in doing so, and Blodgett puts the blame firmly at\
  \ Numan's door.\n\u201CIntentionally or not, Numan planted the idea in people's\
  \ heads that in future their friends would be electric,\u201D he writes, \u201C\
  Thus today's citizens are less open to the idea that they may have friends made\
  \ out of gas. This is a great pity. I have found companionship and joy with my little\
  \ band of gas pals. They have much to offer in the hurly burly of contemporary life,\
  \ and I urge each and every one of you to put out the hand of friendship to members\
  \ of the gas community. Next time you are waiting at the bus stop and notice a cloud\
  \ of luminous gas approaching you, take that bold step. Shed your Numanoid prejudices\
  \ and greet that gas-cloud as a compadre. You can make a difference.\u201D\nBlodgett\
  \ has been hoping to appear on Newsnight to further his cause, but the producers\
  \ are somewhat wary after the Pilbrow incident, and have no plans to invite him\
  \ on to the programme.\n[2007-06-22]"
