text: "The scene is the deck of a warship. The crew, doughty sailors all, are on battle\
  \ stations. Klaxons are blaring and bells are clanging. Above, in a clear blue sky,\
  \ a fleet of enemy dive-bombers comes sweeping into view. The ship is under attack\
  \ from the air! There is shouting and panic and uproar. In the midst of it all,\
  \ the captain on the bridge is laughing his head off, telling jokes, being generally\
  \ puckish and amusing and, perhaps, suggesting they set up the ping pong table for\
  \ a quick game of whiff whaff.\nThis, I surmise, is broadly speaking what prompted\
  \ Captain Hugh Corbett, DSC, DSO, to be mentioned in dispatches for his \u201Cconspicuous\
  \ cheerfulness under air attack\u201D. Not bravery, nor presence of mind, nor true\
  \ grit, but cheerfulness. There is somehow a hint that, when not under attack, he\
  \ was a bit mopey and miserable. Then the enemy planes come roaring and swooping\
  \ and he brightens up.\nCaptain Corbett has died at the age of 95, and his obituary\
  \ appeared in the\_Grauniad in the Other Lives section where readers commemorate\
  \ the otherwise unknown, uncelebrated and unsung who have passed away. Though the\
  \ good captain may still be with us, in some ethereal realm, for after his retirement\
  \ from the Royal Navy, we are told, he became the vice-chairman of the Churches\
  \ Fellowship for Psychical and Spiritual Studies. He might use any psychic powers\
  \ gained in the post to send eerie messages from beyond the grave. Given his warship\
  \ experience, however, it is possible that any such messages might be rather disturbing.\n\
  \u201CFeeling a bit down in the dumps being dead,\u201D his psychic essence might\
  \ communicate, \u201CCould do with cheering up. Please arrange to have my grave\
  \ subjected to aerial bombardment.\u201D\nI think it worth noting that Captain Corbett\
  \ was cited not just for being cheerful but for being conspicuously cheerful. I\
  \ wonder quite what this means. Perhaps it was simply that he laughed loudly and\
  \ went around slapping other crew members on the back. Or maybe he dressed up as\
  \ a clown, in the fashion of Bluebottle (see below). If his ethereal shade is reading\
  \ this, should there be access to Het Internet in the Elysian Fields, it would be\
  \ nice if he could psychically communicate with me to give me a bit more detail.\n\
  I can imagine that conspicuous cheerfulness could be somewhat irritating, particularly\
  \ when one is being strafed by a Stuka. A fit of the giggles could also be construed\
  \ as the verge of hysteria. It would be interesting to learn if any wartime ship's\
  \ captains were ever mentioned in dispatches for \u201Cconspicuous hysteria under\
  \ air attack\u201D. Or, indeed, a gamut of other emotions and reactions. Conspicuous\
  \ grumpiness. Conspicuous irksomeness. Conspicuous desire to listen to Frippertronics.\
  \ Conspicuous inconspicuousness.\nThat last would be a difficult one to pull off,\
  \ but not, I would think, if one displayed psychic powers like Captain Corbett.\
  \ Using eldritch manipulations of the space time continuum, it would surely be possible\
  \ to be very much there, on the spot, conspicuous, and yet not there at all, hidden,\
  \ occult, inconspicuous. In the midst of battle, while being attacked by machine-gun-rattling\
  \ Stukas and dive-bombers, this could be a highly-prized quality. It would surely\
  \ confuse the enemy, though of course it might equally confuse one's own crew. And\
  \ if one's own crew became confused, skittering about the decks in haphazard fashion,\
  \ not knowing their keels from their false keels, their gripes from their strakes,\
  \ their garboard from their larboard, their bulwark from their cathead, or their\
  \ orlop from their poop, then soon enough one is going to find oneself the captain\
  \ of a ship of fools.\nAt which point I should confess that it has long been my\
  \ desire to sail aboard a ship of fools. There are plenty of fools on land, of course,\
  \ but the prospect of being aboard a ship on which every single person is an irredeemable\
  \ fool has a peculiar attraction. Would my presence on such a ship make a fool of\
  \ me, too? Well it might, but it is a risk I am willing to take, should any fool-ship\
  \ see fit to invite me on board and give me a berth in a cabin of fools. Think of\
  \ the jollity, the hysteria, and indeed the conspicuous cheerfulness to be found\
  \ on a fool-ship! It would be a Dionysian bacchanal, afloat on the ocean wave.\n\
  The only drawback I can think of is that, as we well know, because we have had it\
  \ drummed into us, worse things happen at sea. But they would only be mildly worse\
  \ if we remained determinedly and conspicuously cheerful. To that end, it would\
  \ be a good idea, to have among our complement of fools, a clown or two. Whatever\
  \ else you might say about clowns, you could never accuse them of being inconspicuous.\
  \ Take, for example, Bluebottle The Clown, pictured here at a gathering to commemorate\
  \ Joseph Grimaldi on the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of his death.\
  \ (And my thanks to Spitalfields Life for the snap.) Bluebottle is both cheerful\
  \ and conspicuous. But unlike Captain Corbett, I do not think he would have been\
  \ best pleased had the grave of the legendary clown come under aerial attack. I\
  \ think we can assume from his cheerful grin that bombardment of the grave did not\
  \ occur.\n\n[2012-06-02]"
