text: "Looking back on my life, I believe one of the greatest challenges I ever had\
  \ to face was when I found myself in possession of a glut of leeks. It was the first\u2014\
  so far the only\u2014time fate brought me to such a pass, so it is no wonder that\
  \ I was at sixes and sevens. And let me assure you that I had many, many more leeks\
  \ than six or seven. I had a glut of them, and I did not know what to do.\nWith\
  \ hindsight, I can see clearly that I was wholly unprepared. But that was not something\
  \ I wished to admit to myself, in my vigorous youth. Living as I did in a fool's\
  \ paradise, I thought there was nothing I could not achieve. In spite of my perplexity,\
  \ I was confident I could find some use for a glut of leeks before they began, as\
  \ cruel nature demanded, to rot.\nI tried out various schemes, some seemingly sensible,\
  \ others wild and unhinged. No matter what I did, I was making no serious depredations\
  \ to the glut. The leeks I had were countless, so I did not attempt to count them.\
  \ The glut remained a glut.\nThen, one day, I received news of an impending visit\
  \ from my spiritual adviser, lifestyle coach, and tobogganing partner, the dwarf\
  \ Crepusco. Heaven forfend, I thought, that he should have to fight his way through\
  \ a glut of leeks simply to reach the armchair I reserved for him anent the radiator.\
  \ (Crepusco suffered dreadfully from the cold.) Thus it was that I cobbled together\
  \ a sort of pulley system and hoisted each and every leek in the glut up from the\
  \ floor so it dangled from the ceiling.\nUnfortunately, so low was my ceiling in\
  \ that place at that time, that I, being taller than a dwarf, found myself, when\
  \ standing, in the midst of dangling vertical leeks. My vision was occluded, and\
  \ I had to jostle my way through them blindly. No such terrors for the dwarf Crepusco,\
  \ who sailed past me, sat himself in the armchair, and, as I had hoped he would,\
  \ dispensed advice.\n\u201CAs your spiritual adviser,\u201D he said, \u201CI have\
  \ nothing to say. As your tobogganing partner, I note we are due to make a run down\
  \ a mighty crevasse next Thursday. And as your lifestyle coach, let me just say\
  \ that I am deeply impressed by your innovative interior design initiative. A room\
  \ with hanging leeks in profusion is both piquant and leeky, and is that not a combination\
  \ anyone sensitive to interior design would kill for?\u201D\nI blundered against\
  \ the dado rail, doing myself a mischief, but I had to acknowledge his wisdom.\n\
  Some while later, of course, the leeks did rot, but by then I had made a name for\
  \ myself as a piquant and leeky interior designer, and I never looked back.\n\n\
