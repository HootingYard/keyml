text: "\nFor my cupboard in The Dabbler this week I have exhumed, dusted down, and\
  \ spruced up a short piece that appeared on Hooting Yard long long ago. It occurs\
  \ to me that it serves as a first variation on a theme by Gerard Manley Hopkins,\
  \ the \u201Ctheme\u201D in this case being the tall nun from The Wreck Of The Deutschland.\
  \ Her name, incidentally, was Henrica Fassbender, her last words were reported as\
  \ \u201COh Christ, Christ, come quickly!\u201D, and her body was never found. But\
  \ she is commemorated on the headstone in St Patrick's Cemetery, Leytonstone, where\
  \ the other four drowned Franciscan nuns were buried. Go here for a photograph of\
  \ the headstone and an amusing anecdote.\nSister Hortense, the even taller nun in\
  \ my little tale, is not actually based on Henrica Fassbender. All they have in\
  \ common is nundom, tallness, and of course a predilection for ships, in Hortense's\
  \ case a barquentine, in Henrica's a German steamship.\n[2011-08-05]"
