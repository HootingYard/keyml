text: "A thing which had a different, a horror-like beauty like a mad Goya etching,\
  \ occurred when the black priestess did her death dance with the huge white turkey.\
  \ Though far from feeble, possessed of great vitality, she was a slender woman,\
  \ slightly formed, whose nervous strength lay not in muscular weight. When the turkey's\
  \ wings spread wide and began to flap frantically above her head as she whirled,\
  \ the great bird seemed larger and more powerful than she; it seemed that she would\
  \ be dragged from her feet, hurled to the ground, or flown away with fabulously\
  \ into the sky. And as she sought finally to tear off its head, sought to clutch\
  \ its body between her knees, it attacked her savagely, beating her face and breasts,\
  \ beating at her so that she was at moments enfolded by the great white wings, so\
  \ that bird and woman seemed to mingle struggling in a monstrous, mythical embrace.\
  \ But her fatal hands were still upon its throat, and in that swanlike simulacre\
  \ of the deed which for the male is always like a little death, it died.\nSo savage\
  \ had this scene been that it was almost like an anticlimax when the sacrificial\
  \ goat was now led through the doorway to the altar\u2026\nW B Seabrook describes\
  \ his voodoo blood baptism in Haiti in The Magic Island (1929)\n[2011-03-21]"
