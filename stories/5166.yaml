text: "\nThis week at The Dabbler my cupboard features the well-loved Hooting Yard\
  \ Pontiff Mnemonic. When declaimed aloud it is always a crowd-pleaser, so I should\
  \ take this opportunity to remind readers that, for an appropriate fee, I will be\
  \ happy to come and shout it aloud at your community social cohesion hub or neighbourhood\
  \ frolic \u2018n\u2019 learning zone. I was hoping I might get an invitation to\
  \ boom it out at one of the official events during the imminent Papal visit, but\
  \ as yet no Vatican nuncio has beaten a path to my door, alas.\nADDENDUM\_: In the\
  \ comments at The Dabbler, Barendina Smedley asks \u201CSo, who's going to set this\
  \ as plainsong?\u201D and imagines it being chanted lugubriously. Perhaps a musically\
  \ inclined reader might wish to take up her suggestion\u2026\n[2010-09-03]"
