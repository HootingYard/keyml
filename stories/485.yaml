text: "If, like me, you are unreasonably obsessed with the weird goings-on in the\
  \ Anglican church, you might have discovered the blog being tapped out by Bishop\
  \ Gene Robinson*. I am certainly pleased that I stumbled upon it, for I have learned\
  \ about Saint Rumwold.\nSaint Rumwold was born at King's Sutton in AD 662, the son\
  \ of Saint Cyneburga and King Alchfrid. His first words, on the day he was born,\
  \ were \u201CI am a Christian\u201D. He then asked to be baptised, and to receive\
  \ Holy Communion. The next day he preached a sermon, quoting freely from Scripture.\
  \ On the third day he addressed another sermon, to his parents, and then he keeled\
  \ over and died. A pious infant indeed.\nPossibly even more pious than Edward Gorey's\
  \ Henry Clump\u2026\n\n*NOTE\_: Pansy Cradledew has asked me to point out that Bishop\
  \ Gene Robinson, a gay bishop, should not be confused with Gay Bishop, the TV newsreader\
  \ who sometimes presents news items about gay bishops.\n[2008-07-19]"
