text: "One la-la-la morning, Tiny Enid was limping along the cliffs at the edge of\
  \ the Big Frightening Sea when, across the sky, zooming directly at her, came a\
  \ gigantic colourful bewinged flying insect of unknown provenance. Most infants\
  \ would have screeched in terror and cried for Ma or Pa to rescue them, but of course\
  \ the plucky fascist tot was not most infants. She raised her arms, as if in terror,\
  \ to pull the wool over the huge airborne being's eyes, if it actually had any,\
  \ and screech she did, but it was a screech not of fright but of blood-curdling\
  \ menace. It was so terrific a screech that the enormous brightly-coloured mothish\
  \ type of thing was immediately deafened, playing havoc with its complicated navigational\
  \ head integuments, and it plummeted forthwith into the broiling waters where, unable\
  \ to swim, it drowned.\nTiny Enid let fall her arms and patted the pocket wherein\
  \ she carried her tiny toy Mannlicher-Carcano sniper's rifle which, in spite of\
  \ being tiny, and a toy, was a devastatingly effective firearm.\n\u201CI am glad\
  \ I did not have to use my trusty sniper's rifle to slaughter that curious wing-flapping\
  \ monster,\u201D she thought, \u201CFor it remains fully loaded and I can put the\
  \ bullets to better use, should I happen later this morning to come upon malefactors\
  \ and ne'er-do-wells roaming the cliffs.\u201D\nAs indeed she did, but that is another\
  \ story for another, more gruesome, time.\n\nIllustration by Vladimir Konashevich,\
