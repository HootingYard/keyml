text: "The splendid Wartime Housewife has a potsage* about her reading life, in which\
  \ she notes that \u201Cif I stopped reading, I would feel that I had completely\
  \ lost control of my life and my sense of self\u201D, a sentiment with which I'd\
  \ concur. (\u201CMelodramatic, I know\u201D she adds, but, ah!, where would we be\
  \ without a leavening of melodrama?)\nWhat surprised me was for one so bookish to\
  \ state that it was only in the last couple of years she began to keep a record\
  \ of the books she reads. From the time I began reading books\u2014as opposed to\
  \ The Beano and Wham!\u2014it never occurred to me not to keep a list. Alas, somewhere\
  \ along the line the first few years\u2019 of my records were lost, but I have a\
  \ note of every book I have read since 1982. (Which year began, since you ask, with\
  \ The Annotated Snark by Martin Gardner.)\nIt is not often I browse back over the\
  \ list\u2014now maintained, of course, on what Dr Alan Statham at one point calls\
  \ a \u201Ccompyoodah\u201D\u2014but when I do I am struck by two things in particular.\
  \ There are the books of which I retain no memory whatsoever, and could thus reread\
  \ as if for the first time, and there are the ones which, even if ill-remembered,\
  \ summon for me the time and the place they were read with astonishing clarity.\
  \ (Why do I recall so vividly, for example, that I read the bulk of The Tax Inspector\
  \ by Peter Carey sitting by a lake, to the sound of birdsong? I remember the setting,\
  \ but almost nothing of the novel.)\nOf late, visitors to Hooting Yard could probably\
  \ piece together what I've been reading, day by day and week by week. There's something\
  \ to keep you occupied when you find yourselves at a loose end.\n*NOTE\_: This is\
  \ a deliberate error. It is a clue to a book which appears more than once on my\
  \ twenty-eight-year reading list. But which book?\n[2010-08-03]"
