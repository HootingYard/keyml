text: 'Oh look, shifting sands! If you stand quite still, and shut your eyes, and
  wait for, say, five minutes before opening them, when you do you will find yourself
  in an utterly different terrain. When you were not looking, the sands shifted, and
  now all is strange and bewildering.

  On the beach at Shifting, a lovely little seaside town in Hoonshire, it is common
  to see people standing stock still with their eyes shut. It is common, too, to see
  looks of disappointment, even devastation, cross their faces, when they open their
  eyes to find the beach unchanged from how it was five minutes before. This is because
  the sands at Shifting Sands are not shifting sands. They are what are known as inert
  sands, roughly speaking. What shifting occurs, occasioned by the wind and the tides,
  is slow and imperceptible.

  What they do have at Shifting Sands are perilous pockets of quicksand. Beware! Best
  not even to think about those pockets, for if you do, you will sink into the quicksand
  of your thought, and you won''t have the power anymore.
