text: "Another snippet from Richard O'Connor's 1967 biography of Ambrose Bierce:\n\
  \u201CThe book-reviewing end of his chores, predictably, loosed [Bierce's] most\
  \ savage energies\u2026 He once composed what may be the shortest, nastiest book\
  \ review on the record by listing its title, author and publisher and adding the\
  \ one-line comment, \u2018The covers of this book are too far apart\u2019.\n\u201C\
  Occasionally, like an eagle swooping down on the carrion-littered plains of literature,\
  \ he would quote one paragraph of a current novel as an example of hopelessly bad\
  \ writing. Such as\_: \u2018She remained inactive in his embrace for a considerable\
  \ period, then modestly disengaging herself looked him full in the countenance and\
  \ signified a desire for self-communion. By love's instinct he divined her purpose\u2014\
  she wanted to consider his proposal apart from the influence of the glamour of his\
  \ personal presence. With the innate tact of a truly genteel nature he bade her\
  \ good evening in French, and with measured tread paced away into the gathering\
  \ gloom\u2019.\u201D\nAlas, we are not told the titles of the two books under review.\n\
