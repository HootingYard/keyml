text: "\u201CWoolworth's is no more,\u201D said a headline I spotted in a newspaper.\
  \ I did not quite grasp what it meant\u2014that apostrophe s seemed misplaced\u2014\
  so I ruminated, as I do whenever I encounter something perplexing. My usual method\
  \ is to stare out of the window awaiting enlightenment, so that is what I did. I\
  \ felt it would have been of immense help if the view from my window was of a hillside\
  \ with a lot of sheep on it, but I am afraid to say that all I could see was the\
  \ perimeter fence of a derelict shopping precinct. Had I been able to see some sheep\
  \ I could have grabbed a pair of binoculars and examined closely the fleeces of\
  \ the sheep, assuming they were unsheared, to ascertain why their wool no longer\
  \ had any worth. In the absence of any useful visual prompt, I was forced to rely\
  \ upon the cerebral activity buzzing within the confines of my skull\u2014a skull,\
  \ I should add, that has won plaudits from a number of highly competent phrenologists.\
  \ Dr Bramblegack described it as \u201Cimpeccably cranial, with lovely dents\u201D\
  .\nAfter gazing at the collapsing retail hub for a few hours, I reached some preliminary\
  \ conclusions about wool having no worth. I shall present them to you now, with\
  \ the proviso that you keep them under your hat until I give the all clear. There\
  \ is no pressing reason for secrecy, but I find it adds a frisson of excitement\
  \ to the daily round. For example, when I pop out to buy a pint of milk or a packet\
  \ of surprisingly delicious vegan pork-style scrapings, I will sometimes pretend\
  \ that I have been sent on a mission by SMERSH, and loiter outside the shop muttering\
  \ into a concealed walkie-talkie for an hour or so.\nMy first provisional conclusion\
  \ is that wool has gone bad, or become contaminated in some way, and is therefore\
  \ to be shunned on health grounds. It follows from this that sheep are carriers\
  \ of bad wool, and must be culled. Few save for the bloodthirsty would willingly\
  \ slaughter innumerable sheep, so quarantine may be preferred to a cull, if a secure\
  \ area of sufficient acreage can be found. Helicopters could hover over the site,\
  \ ensuring no sheep made a run for it after bounding over the barbed wire fence.\n\
  My second provisional conclusion is that wool has lost its worth due to a glut.\
  \ This would not be the first wool glut in history, but perhaps the most severe\
  \ one. The best way to address the glut is to identify new uses for wool, to stimulate\
  \ demand. Coupled with an authoritarian approach, the surplus wool would soon get\
  \ used up. So, step one is to issue a decree that anyone not making conspicuous\
  \ daily use of the new wool-based products, such as woolly satnav, woolly catnip,\
  \ woolly bubblebath and woolly fireworks, would be shot on sight.\nMy third provisional\
  \ conclusion is a simple one. Wool has had its time, and that time has passed, and\
  \ we must stride onward to a bright new utopia under the benevolent gaze of the\
  \ Great Helmswoman, be she Hazel Blears or, at a push, Agnetha\_F\xE4ltskog.\nAlthough\
  \ I would not wish to prod you towards one or other of my conclusions, it ought\
  \ to be noted that this piece was typed entirely with a \u201Cwoolboard\u201D, a\
  \ thrilling new computer-style keyboard made out of one hundred percent uncontaminated\
  \ wool.\n[2009-01-07]"
