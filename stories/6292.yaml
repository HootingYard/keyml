text: "My ascent into heaven was, I am sorry to say, something of a disappointment.\
  \ To begin with, the angels who bore me aloft, away from mortal clay, were a shabby\
  \ bunch. Their wings were threadbare and caked in dust, their golden locks were\
  \ greasy and unwashed, and as for their faces! As pockmarked as Stalin's, and as\
  \ charmless!\nThings got no better when, after much puff, we eventually fetched\
  \ up at the pearly gates. The pearls themselves were tarnished, and I suspected\
  \ they had been eked from infected oysters, ones with the bivalve mollusc equivalent\
  \ of human scrofula. They were stuck to the gates with some kind of heavenly gum\
  \ or paste which had an unbearable stink and further discoloured the pearls. Whatever\
  \ this stuff was\u2014a sort of sticky ectoplasm?\u2014it lacked adhesive heft,\
  \ for quite a few pearls were either loose or had fallen from the gates and were\
  \ scattered in the gutter. I had not expected gutters in heaven, nor drains, nor\
  \ sewers, which is I suppose a mark of my naivet\xE9.\nI cannot bring myself to\
  \ go into detail about St Peter. Suffice to say that his resemblance to Stalin was\
  \ starker than that of the angels. The appraisal interview in which my time on earth\
  \ was picked over in forensic detail was a sore trial unto me, not because I had\
  \ wallowed in moral squalor, but rather because it acted as a reminder of the tedium\
  \ and waste and sheer futility of my life. Also, I was kept standing throughout,\
  \ when all I wanted was to rest my weary bones\u2014my weary dead bones, remember\u2014\
  sprawled on a sofa or divan. And not only was I kept standing, but kept standing\
  \ in a puddle, because the nearest drain was blocked, clogged up with heavenmuck.\n\
  At long last Stalin\u2014sorry, St Peter\u2014waved me through the gates. I thought\
  \ I would be escorted by the tatty angels, or at least one of them, but they were\
  \ sent back down to the terrestrial plane to gather up another poor dead sod. So,\
  \ all alone, I stumbled into the light. The cloudy clumps beneath my feet were treacherous.\
  \ It was like walking through a marsh where all the water had turned to gas. Here\
  \ and there I spotted harps, abandoned, rust-covered and with broken strings. Clearly\
  \ they had not been played in living memory.\nBut I realised of course there could\
  \ be no such thing as living memory here in heaven, where we were all dead. At least,\
  \ I was. I couldn't see another soul in the entire expanse of misty light which\
  \ stretched as far as I could see. Hey-ho. I picked a cloudy clump at random and\
  \ lay down upon it, and I waited for trumpets and hosannahs. Then it started to\
  \ rain.\nTwenty-five billion years later, fully rested, I sat up and peered into\
  \ the mist. The torrential rain had slowed to a drizzle. Off in the distance, I\
  \ saw a wall had been erected. I heaved myself to my feet and squished through the\
  \ milky clumps towards it. As I approached, an angel of the Lord appeared, carrying\
  \ a step-ladder and a bucket of gum or paste and a brush and a large roll of paper.\
  \ I watched the angel erect the step ladder and clamber up it and spread paste upon\
  \ the wall and unroll the paper and stick it up and brush it smooth and descend\
  \ the step ladder and pick it up and carry it and the bucket and the brush away,\
  \ vanishing into the mist. When I got closer, I saw it was a gigantic poster of\
  \ Stalin. Not St Peter, but Stalin himself. Under his grim yet avuncular countenance,\
  \ there was a slogan. Unfortunately I cannot read Russian. I felt sure the words\
  \ were egging me on in the valiant struggle for a Utopian workers\u2019 future,\
  \ with tractors and electrification and rallies. I struck a determined pose, staring\
  \ forward, pointing at nothing. For there was nothing, just the poster on the wall\
  \ and the endless expanse of white misty milky light, in heaven.\n[2011-03-29]"
