  \ throne. The light pours out of him. Enter Sir Cleothgard, the King's Chamberlain.\n\
  Chamberlain\_: May I be ushered into your dazzling presence, O mighty King?\nKing\_\
  : Yes, yes, come in, Sir Cleothgard. Execute the necessary fawning and scraping,\
  \ prostrate yourself in the muck, then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking\
  \ for'ard, but not too close.\nSir Cleothgard does as he is commanded.\nChamberlain\_\
  : I bring grave news from the frontier, Sire.\nKing\_: Really? What have you been\
  \ doing, galumphing around the frontier, when your duties lie here in the chamber?\n\
  Chamberlain : I thought I would get a bit of fresh air, O lord of light.\nKing\_\
  : Did you indeed? Are you suggesting that the chamber is a fug of stale air enmixed\
  \ with noisome pongs?\nChamberlain\_: Not for a moment, Sire. Truly, it is bliss\
  \ to breathe the merest atom of air in the vicinity of your regal presence. And\
  \ rest assured that all the while I was gallivanting I was in constant contact with\
  \ the underchamberlain via my cordless metal tapping machine, ready to rush! rush!\
  \ rush! to your side should my services be required.\nKing\_: And now you have come\
  \ rush! rush! rushing!, so what is afoot?\nChamberlain : As I said, Sire, grave\
  \ news, grave news indeed. You know that those who dwell beyond the frontier are,\
  \ by definition, strangers? But of course you do! You are the King, and therefore\
  \ omniscient. Be that as it may, while I was out and about, mincing around the frontier\
  \ lands, I had the opportunity to study the eyes of the strangers. I carried with\
  \ me, as I always do, an oculoscope, crafted for me by the court wizardy man, Ulg.\n\
  King : Ulg is indeed a great servant of the crown, and the maker of many a bewildering\
  \ instrument. Go on.\nChamberlain\_: It pains me to say it, Sire, but when I peered\
  \ through Ulg's oculoscope into the eyes of the strangers, I was begraunt a vision,\
  \ reflected back at me, of your puissance.\nKing : Ah! My puissance! How I treasure\
  \ it! You know, Sir Cleothgard, that few kings in all history have had puissance\
  \ as puissant as mine?\nChamberlain\_: Indeed, Your Magnificence. But the puissance\
  \ I saw in the eyes of those strangers was ruin'd, quite, quite ruin'd!\nKing\_\
  : Bloody hell! Really?\nChamberlain : I am afraid so, Sire.\nKing : You realise\
  \ what this means, Sir Cleothgard? War! It means war!\nChamberlain\_: I am well\
  \ aware of that, Sire.\nKing : You must immediately prepare my army and my navy\
  \ and my air force and my special forces and my black ops unit for battle.\nChamberlain\_\
  : I have already taken the liberty of doing just that, Sire. They are fully provisioned\
  \ and victualled and marching or sailing or ballooning off to the frontier to do\
  \ battle with your foes.\nKing\_: Excellent, Sir Cleothgard. I will pin a medal\
  \ on your chest in recognition of your brio. But not before you have flown to the\
  \ United Nations headquarters to present our case to the Security Council. I wish\
  \ to get their blessing that this is a just war, in the terms laid down by the great\
  \ French writer Racine.\nChamberlain\_: If I might be so bold, O majestic one, why\
  \ bother with those jumped-up bureaucrats and paper-pushers?\nKing\_: For the very\
  \ simple reason that once I have prosecuted this war, and defeated the enemy, and\
  \ my puissance is once again restored to fantasticness, I do not wish to be haunted,\
  \ where'er I go, by gaggles of unruly placard-waving wankers protesting that it\
  \ was an unjust or illegal war, as happened with Tony Blair.\nChamberlain\_: Of\
  \ course, Sire, I ought to have thought of that and got Security Council clearance\
  \ already.\nKing\_: Yes, Sir Cleothgard, you should. Perhaps I may not give you\
  \ a medal after all, but instead have your head lopped off and stuck upon a spike.\n\
  Chamberlain\_: Oo-er!\nKing\_: Ho ho ho. I was only joking. Now, off you go to the\
  \ United Nations.\nChamberlain\_: At once, Sire!\nExit Chamberlain.\nScene Two\_\
  : The King's Chamber. The King is seated in effulgent glory on his throne. The light\
  \ pours out of him. Enter Sir Potipharge, the King's Underchamberlain.\nUnderchamberlain\_\
  : May I be ushered into your dazzling presence, O mighty King?\nKing\_: Yes, yes,\
  \ come in, Sir Potipharge. Execute the necessary fawning and scraping, prostrate\
  \ yourself in the muck, then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking for'ard,\
  \ but not too close.\nSir Potipharge does as he is commanded.\nUnderchamberlain\_\
  : I bring grave news from the United Nations, Sire.\nKing : What now?\nUnderchamberlain\_\
  : Your Chamberlain, Sir Cleothgard, was mistaken for the diplomat Lester Townsend\
  \ and stabbed in the back by a knife hurled with expert dexterity by a dour grim\
  \ agent in the pay of Phillip Vandamm, Sire.\nKing\_: Crikey! What does this mean\
  \ for my puissance?\nUnderchamberlain\_: I fear it is ruin'd, Your Effulgence, quite,\
  \ quite ruin'd.\nThey sob. Bats swoop from down from the rafters and darkness falls.\n\
