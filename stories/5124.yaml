text: "Instruct the tinies in your charge to read carefully the passage about Thomas\
  \ Babington Macaulay's great-grandfather. Allow sufficient time so that even the\
  \ dimwits and the ones who drool will be able to complete the task. Standing imperiously\
  \ at your lectern, your arms folded in the manner of the Reverend J C M Bellew,\
  \ roar at the top of your voice the following set of questions designed to test\
  \ the tinies\u2019 comprehension. They should scrape their answers on their slates.\
  \ Model answers are given below, just in case you yourself have failed to comprehend\
  \ the passage because your brain is fuming with visions of sprites and monsters.\n\

  \ his stipend.\nQ. In the jaws of utter destitution, what was the Minister's admirable\

  Q. Describe the air.\nA. The air was unwholesome and fetid and murky and rank and\
  \ corrupt and mephitic and damp and vile and foul.\nADDENDUM : I was going to suggest\
  \ that in the next part of the lesson you get the tinies to deconstruct the passage,\
  \ but having read the following, I suspect that would not be such a good idea:\n\
  \u201CAsked to characterise the deconstructionists he has known, an exasperated\
  \ professor who specialises in modern British literature delivered this tirade:\
  \ \u2018Arrogant, smug, snotty, meretricious, addicted to straw-man arguments, horrible\
  \ writers who demand to be of the company of Jane Austen and Chaucer, appallingly\
  \ ingrown and cliquish at the same time that they talk about expansiveness and new\
  \ frontiers of discourse, unbelievably wooden and mechanical at the same time that\
  \ they make their wooden and mechanical obeisances to jouissance and free-play,\
  \ like all perpetual adolescents contemptuous of the past and convinced that by\
  \ great good fortune the truth happened to be discovered just as they were hitting\
  \ puberty, a daisy-chain of brown-nosers declaring their high-flown independence\
  \ from the normal irksome constraints of community and continuity, who without the\
  \ peculiar heads-I-win-tails-you-lose rationale of their arguments\u2014if evidence\
  \ and logic bear me out, fine, if not, we can always deconstruct them\u2014would\
  \ almost none of them have written an essay that could stand up in a decent senior\
  \ seminar.'\u201D\nQuoted in David Lehamn, Signs Of The Times\_: Deconstruction\
  \ And The Fall Of Paul De Man (1991). Sadly, Lehman does not\_ reveal the identity\
  \ of this prize ranter.\n[2010-08-26]"
