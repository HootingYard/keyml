text: "The new logo for the 2012 London Olympics has caused a flap. Sorry, it's not\
  \ a logo, it's a brand, a brand which, according to diminutive Culture Secretary\
  \ Tessa Jowell, \u201Ctakes our values to the world beyond our shores, acting both\
  \ as an invitation and an inspiration\u201D. I agree, and I know that Hooting Yard's\
  \ values are exactly the same in every last detail as Tessa's. In fact, at an editorial\
  \ conclave the other day, loveable octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins looked up from\
  \ her knitting and said \u201CWhen in doubt, just ask \u2018What would Tessa Jowell\
  \ do?\u2019\u201D and we all nodded in recognition of the deep wisdom of those words.\
  \ (All except the bloated janitor, of course, who still swears by Blunkett, but\
  \ that's another story.)\nCertain people seem to think that the logo\u2014the brand,\
  \ the brand!\u2014is devoid of content and meaning, and make the same charge against\
  \ Tessa's words. Such carping is only to be expected. For my money, anything Tessa\
  \ Jowell says ought to be carved in stone and studied, much as one would study the\
  \ work of a great literary giant. The rewards are immense.\nTo show that I know\
  \ what I'm talking about, we commissioned a new Hooting Yard brand, the better to\
  \ embody our values. It cost slightly more than the \xA3400,000 price tag of the\
  \ Olympic thing of beauty, but I'm sure you will agree that it was money well spent.\
  \ At a meeting to identify funding, the vitamin-deficient inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage\
  \ insisted that they can cope with severely reduced gruel rations for the next forty\
  \ years. Indeed, they have never looked so blissful.\n\n[2007-06-05]"
