text: "Last week, Mrs Gubbins suffered some sort of mental collapse and called in\
  \ a team of consultants to overhaul the Hooting Yard \u201Cbrand image\u201D. The\
  \ octogenarian crone put aside her knitting and got it into her head that what was\
  \ needed was a brand new logo. \u201CIt has to be punchy and zippy and bangy and\
  \ crashy,\u201D she drivelled, adding that she wanted something that a half-blind\
  \ orphan child could reproduce with a crumbling crayon. I have no idea how much\
  \ the consultants charged for their work, but knowing these charlatans it was probably\
  \ thousands and thousands of pounds. When the invoice turns up I shall cast it into\
  \ a waste disposal chute. Anyway, here is the new logo, based I am told on an illustration\
  \ from an alchemical treatise of long, long ago.\n\n\_\n[2009-02-27]"
