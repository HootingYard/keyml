text: "In 1871, T. H. Huxley was invited to join a committee for the investigation\
  \ of Spiritualist phenomena. He declined, writing:\nsupposing the phenomena to be\
  \ genuine\u2014they do not interest me. If anybody would endow me with the faculty\
  \ of listening to the chatter of old women and curates in the nearest cathedral\
  \ town, I should decline the privilege, having better things to do.\nAnd if the\
  \ folk in the spiritual world do not talk more wisely and sensibly than their friends\
  \ report them to do, I put them in the same category.\nThe only good that I can\
  \ see in a demonstration of the truth of \u2018Spiritualism\u2019 is to furnish\
  \ an additional argument against suicide. Better live a crossing-sweeper than die\
  \ and be made to talk twaddle by a \u2018medium\u2019 hired at a guinea a s\xE9\
  ance.\nQuoted in The Founders Of Psychical Research by Alan Gauld (Routledge & Kegan\
