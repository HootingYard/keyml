  \ Bookshop Dog. This is a fairly blatant piece of advertising for Woolfson & Tay,\
  \ the independent bookshop\u2014now moved from Bermondsey Square to Bankside\u2014\
  which, in 2011, hosted that memorable, indeed imperishable, Evening Of Lugubrious\
  \ Music & Lopsided Prose. I urge those of you who live within a thousand-mile radius\
  \ to visit the shop regularly, and buy books, and drink tea, and eat cake.\n[2013-06-07]"
