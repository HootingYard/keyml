text: "Yesterday I remarked that you've got to search for the hero inside yourself,\
  \ particularly if you are a weed and a milksop. But clearly, you need not do any\
  \ such thing. It is simply an example of the worst kind of aspirational pap peddled\
  \ by pop singers and television programmes and so-called \u201Clifestyle\u201D magazines\
  \ which besmirch the cultural landscape like so many contaminated puddles in which\
  \ mutant aquatic beings slither and squirm and squirt toxic gack.\nYou might argue\
  \ that I am over-egging my metaphor, but to do so would suggest that there is such\
  \ a concept as \u201Ctoo many eggs\u201D which, unless you are Alfred Hitchcock,\
  \ is absolute nonsense. How in the name of heaven could one ever have too many eggs?\
  \ Surplus ones can be placed in storage and used as and when they are required,\
  \ whether you are whipping up a tasty egg-based recipe or deploying a metaphor when\
  \ wishing to execrate the twaddle that threatens to engulf us all. Or one can distribute\
  \ one's spare eggs to paupers. A pauper with an egg is no less a pauper, of course,\
  \ but better an egg in his hand than a bowl for begging.\nIf you are really becoming\
  \ overwhelmed with eggs, and your chosen pauper looks halfway capable of poultry\
  \ husbandry, you could even give one of your hens to him. At a stroke, you will\
  \ have reduced the pauper population by one, for a hen-owning person cannot properly\
  \ be considered a pauper as such. He has risen to the status of a property owner.\
  \ Though his property may be only a single scraggy hen, it is still property. Some\
  \ are dismayed at the idea of treating even the least of God's creatures as objects\
  \ of ownership, but that is the kind of sentimental drivel expounded by scruffy\
  \ wastrels who would have us living in the dark ages, without antibiotics, or indeed\
  \ industry, surviving on berries and nuts and rainwater.\nSuch a prescription can\
  \ appear attractive when under the onslaught of contemporary pap. It is easy to\
  \ imagine that one might live a more fulfilling life huddled in a cave snacking\
  \ on almonds instead of being bombarded by visions of cavorting popstrels demanding\
  \ that we search for the hero inside ourselves, or insisting that our hearts will\
  \ go on. But remember, we can tread a more lustrous path, one with the benefits\
  \ of poultry ownership and antibiotics, and much, much else besides, and as we make\
  \ our way along that path, a basket of surplus eggs in one hand and a hen in the\
  \ other, we should keep our eyes peeled for paupers crumpled in ditches along the\
  \ way, paupers we shall raise out of pauperdom with gifts of eggs and a hen, and\
  \ also of any berries and nuts and bottles of saved rainwater we may be carrying\
  \ in our capacious pockets.\n[2008-11-03]"
