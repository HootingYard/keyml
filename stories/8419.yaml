text: "I have not read Geoff Dyer's new book Zona\_: A Book About A Film About A Journey\
  \ To A Room. As the title indicates, it is devoted to a film, Andrei Tarkovsky's\
  \ Stalker (1979) and to Dyer's obsession with it. I vaguely recall seeing Stalker,\
  \ probably around the time of its release, and have not seen it since. Clearly it\
  \ did not make a great impression on me, unlike the same director's Andrei Rublev\
  \ (1966), which I saw in the mid-seventies and from which I can still remember certain\
  \ scenes. Reading a couple of reviews of Dyer's book led me to wondering which film\
  \ I would choose to write an obsessional book about.\nIt then struck me that, much\
  \ as I might be given to enthusiastic ravings about, say, Celine And Julie Go Boating\
  \ (Jacques Rivette, 1974) or The Falls (Peter Greenaway, 1980), or Random Harvest\
  \ (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942), or Even Dwarfs Started Small (Werner Herzog, 1970), or pretty\
  \ much anything directed by Guy Maddin, it is unlikely I will ever sit down and\
  \ concentrate and write about them at length.\nDyer's Zona is, apparently, \u201C\
  one long movie summary, a shot-by-shot rewrite\u201D of Stalker, which I assume\
  \ indicates that he gives us a detailed account of the film and wanders off into\
  \ discursive byways. (At one point he provides us with the useful information that,\
  \ after the completion of Sympathy For The Devil / One Plus One (1968), Mick Jagger\
  \ said of Jean Luc Godard \u201CHe's such a fucking twat\u201D.)\nTaking a similar\
  \ approach, might it not be interesting to consider not just one of my favourite\
  \ films but, say, three of them, and construct a narrative that intermingled them,\
  \ had elements from each colliding, happily or otherwise, stirred them together\
  \ in a pot and made something new and strange? I think this is what young persons\
  \ call a \u201Cmash up\u201D. What would happen were I to sprinkle together, in\
  \ chronological order, Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945),\_Noro\xEEt (Jacques Rivette,\
  \ 1976), and Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988)?\nCertain choices, or strategies, seem\
  \ compellingly obvious. Hans Gruber and his criminal gang could invade and hold\
  \ hostage the occupants, not of the Nakatomi building but of the coastal castle\
  \ which is the setting for Noro\xEEt. Ah, but the castle is home to a pirate gang\
  \ rather than a law-abiding Japanese corporation. So Giulia, the pirate leader,\
  \ could be replaced by Laura Jesson's well-meaning but exasperating friend Dolly\
  \ Messiter. Ruthless German criminals pitted against Francophone female pirates,\
  \ both perhaps to be outwitted by New York cop John McClane, who is attempting to\
  \ rescue Laura, aided by Erika and Morag, the avengers. Dr Alec Harvey can sit in\
  \ a police car with Sergeant Al Powell, parked close to the castle, perhaps in the\
  \ lee of the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing.\nNoro\xEE\
  t is partly based on The Revenger's Tragedy (1606), long attributed to Cyril Tourneur\
  \ but now thought to be the work of Thomas Middleton. These echoes of dark brooding\
  \ Jacobean tragedy should serve to remind us that in Brief Encounter, the part of\
  \ Dr Stephen Lynn, Alec's colleague from whom he borrows the flat for his unseemly\
  \ and sordid\u2014and ultimately abortive\u2014assignation with Laura, was played\
  \ by an uncredited Valentine Dyall (1908\u20131985), an actor whose sepulchral tones\
  \ made him famous as the Man In Black, host of the long-running BBC radio series\
  \ Appointment With Fear. I do not know if Valentine Dyall ever acted in any Jacobean\
  \ tragedies, but if he did not, he should have. He did do some Shakespeare.\nWe\
  \ would have to find a role for Dr Stephen Lynn, perhaps applying his professional\
  \ medical knowledge in the closing scenes of Noro\xEEt, where at a torchlit nocturnal\
  \ masked ball Morag and Erika and Giulia, oops, I forgot, Dolly Messiter, get a\
  \ bit carried away with the stabbings. I suppose John McClane should be wandering\
  \ about in the dark somewhere, too, bloodied and in his vest.\nI realise that I\
  \ have not yet managed to insert any steam trains, nor Albert Godby nor Myrtle Bagot\
  \ from the Milford Junction tea room, nor Holly Gennaro-McClane, nor the pirate\
  \ castle musicians. But fear not, space will be found in my narrative for all of\
  \ them.\nI am in something of a quandary about the title, for though one can cobble\
  \ together various combinations of, here given in alphabetical order, Brief and\
  \ Die and Encounter and Hard and Noro\xEEt, no one admixture springs out as obviously\
  \ preferable. For the time being, while I continue to worry away at it, like a dog\
  \ with a bone, I shall refer to it as My Own Zona, echoing Geoff Dyer.\nCast, in\
