text: "It must be forty years, I think, since last I saw a duck. It is not that I\
  \ have consciously avoided them, though I am willing to admit that I may have done\
  \ so subconsciously. But nothing is more dull than the subconscious, particularly\
  \ one's own, don't you find? Thus I shall pass on the notion that there may have\
  \ been an element of subconscious duck avoidance. The only thing worth saying in\
  \ this connection is that Vladimir Nabokov liked to call Sigmund Freud a \u201C\
  Viennese quack\u201D, and \u201Cquack\u201D, of course, is the usual way we represent\
  \ the characteristic sound made by ducks, in this language at least.\nWhether I\
  \ have avoided them, or they me, the blunt truth is that I have not seen a duck\
  \ since the last years of the war in Vietnam. I did not fight in Vietnam myself\u2014\
  I was too young\u2014nor was that ill-remembered duck I did see, circa 1972, a Vietnamese\
  \ duck, so far as I know. I mention that war merely to give some idea of how much\
  \ time has passed. I could equally say \u201Csince the middle years of the Heath\
  \ government\u201D or \u201Csince the year Ezra Pound died\u201D. Did Ezra Pound\
  \ ever write a poem about ducks? I do not know his work well enough to be able to\
  \ say. Certainly it will not be anything said, or unsaid, by Pound that propelled\
  \ me into the duckless years.\nAt the time, of course, when I saw that teal plashing\
  \ in a pond in a park, I could not have foreseen that so many years would pass without\
  \ my seeing another duck. Had I known, I might have remarked it better. I would\
  \ probably have made a note in my log book, perhaps essayed a little sketch with\
  \ my propelling pencil. That said, it is better that I did not, as I am a hamfisted\
  \ sketcher at the best of times. My attempt might have looked like something other\
  \ than a teal. There are innumerable sketches in my log books, both child and adult,\
  \ where the subject would be wholly unidentifiable had I not added a written caption.\
  \ I know this because in a surprising number of cases I saw no need, at the time,\
  \ to add a caption, and now, whenever I pore over the log books in a fit of nostalgia,\
  \ I have no idea what in the names of all the saints in heaven I am looking at.\
  \ The sole certainly I can cling to, like a drownee to a raft, is that I was not\
  \ sketching a teal, nor any kind of duck, at any time since 1972. That narrows down\
  \ the possible subject matter, but only slightly.\nIf my sketching is so barbarous\
  \ and cackhanded, one may wonder why I have continued to practise it, in my log\
  \ books, through all these years. I could say that it is simply that I am waiting\
  \ for the lead in my propelling pencil to be exhausted. It shows no sign of ever\
  \ reaching its end. Either it is a magic lead that somehow replenishes itself, or\
  \ goblins replace it while I am asleep. There can be no rational explanation.\n\
  Is there, though, a rational explanation for my never seeing a duck for forty long\
  \ years? As I said, I have not consciously avoided them, nor their habitats. In\
  \ a municipal park I often prance through, at least once a week, there is even a\
  \ duckpond. I grant that, for at least the past several years it has been drained,\
  \ and filled with filth and litter, it being that kind of park, but one might have\
  \ expected perhaps to find a stray duck investigating the area on the off-chance\
  \ that volunteers of a conservationist bent could have restored it to watery duckponddom.\
  \ There is always the possibility that there is something about me terrifying to\
  \ ducks, and if indeed a stray merganser or pochard were to come waddling into the\
  \ park in hope of finding the duckpond restored to its former glory, they might\
  \ scarper behind a shrub at the first hint of my approach. But why would I terrify\
  \ a duck?\nIt is true that I do not know enough about the inner workings of a duck's\
  \ brain, its psychology, if a duck could be said to have one, to give a coherent\
  \ answer to that question. All I will say is that it seems unlikely that I have\
  \ certain attributes which would cause mental turmoil to ducks. I have never seen\
  \ a duck flee from my presence, nor indeed any other aquatic creature, nor non-aquatic\
  \ creature come to that, except for such beasts as always flee from humans, the\
  \ nervous ones, such as squirrels and some cats. And there are some beasts which,\
  \ on the contrary, seem to be inexplicably attracted to me. I was once pursued,\
  \ on a country lane, for at least a hundred yards, by a gaggle of honking geese.\
  \ That was in the year of the fall of Saigon, the year Dmitri Shostakovich died.\
  \ Did Shostakovich ever write a divertimento about ducks? I do not know his work\
  \ well enough to be able to say. I wish I did.\nYes, I wish I knew more of Shostakovich,\
  \ but would it be equally true to say that I wish I had seen more\u2014seen any\u2014\
  ducks, in the past four decades? Do I feel a gaping absence in my life because of\
  \ a lack of ducks? That is a hard question to answer. But if I give it due thought,\
  \ I suppose the answer has to be No. After all, if my heart was really set on seeing\
  \ some ducks there is nothing to stop me going out in search of them. There must\
  \ be, somewhere in prancing distance, a park with a duckpond still extant, one not\
  \ drained and rife with filth and litter, a duckpond in which ducks happily plash.\
  \ I should put on my hat and coat and walking boots right this minute, and crash\
  \ out the door, and prance the highways and byways until I light upon such a park,\
  \ with such a duckpond, with such ducks. And taking from my pocket my current log\
  \ book, I should make sketches of them, and append captions, so that, forty years\
  \ hence, when poring over them in a fit of nostalgia, I will be able to identify\
  \ them as the ducks I saw in 2012, after a gap of forty duckless years.\nThat is\
  \ what I should do. But instead, I am tempted to make a cup of tea, and listen to\
  \ Shostakovich, and read Ezra Pound, and imagine myself in hand to hand combat with\
  \ the Vietcong. The ducks can wait.\n[2012-05-20]"
