text: "Michael Gilleland at Laudator Temporis Acti has a marvellous post on words\
  \ ending in \u2013fuge. He notes Thomas Hardy's coinage of dolorifuge in Tess Of\
  \ The D'Urbervilles \u2013\n\u201CThe children \u2026 had made use of this idea\
  \ as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse.\u201D\n\u2013 and cites\
  \ a contemporary reviewer of Hardy complaining about his \u201Coutlandish words\u201D\
  \ \u2013\n\u201CThink how absolutely out of colour in Arcadia are such words as\
  \ \u2018dolorifuge\u2019, \u2018photosphere\u2019, \u2018heliolatries\u2019, \u2018\
  arborescence\u2019, \u2018concatenation\u2019, \u2018noctambulist\u2019\u2014where,\
  \ indeed, are such in colour?\u2014and Mr. Hardy further uses that horrid verb \u2018\
  ecstatisize\u2019.\u201D\nThere are many more \u2013fuge words to chew over, and\
  \ I may well make use of some of them in the coming year.\n[2008-12-31]"
