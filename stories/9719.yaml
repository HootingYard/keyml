  \ for goat-man in Utah wild herd\nI cannot help wondering if the fellow togged up\
  \ as a goat might be related to the goat-boy in that favourite children's rhyme,\
  \ which I am sure all Hooting Yard readers have by heart:\nIncey-wincey goat-boy,\
  \ creature of two realms.\n  We can see you darting in between the elms.\n  Half\
  \ of you is human, the other half's a goat.\n  Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning in\
  \ a moat.\n[2012-07-24]"
