  \ some of them the other day at The Dabbler, but here I wish to confess that it\
  \ was only when watching Eurovision that I learned to pronounce Malm\xF6 correctly.\
  \ I had always thought that the final \xF6 rhymed with dough. Now I know that it\
  \ is more accurately a sort of er or uh sound.\nThis new knowledge led me, by ways\
  \ I will not bother to explain, to devise a plan for an exciting piece of musical\
  \ theatre. Now, I have not studied the life and times of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi\
  \ with any great diligence, nor indeed with any diligence at all. What I know of\
  \ the late tyrant was picked up from news reports\u2014print and broadcast\u2014\
  over the years. So I have no idea whether he ever paid a visit to Sweden. If he\
  \ did not, it does not matter, for my musical can be wholly fictional.\nThe basic\
  \ premise of my all-singing all-dancing show is that Gaddafi, on a visit to Sweden's\
  \ southern capital, is presented by the good burghers of Malm\xF6 with an offering\
  \ of myrrh. I realise this has connotations of the baby Jesus being presented with\
  \ myrrh\u2014plus gold and frankincense\u2014by the three Kings of Orion-Tar, and\
  \ that as a result my show might be accused of blasphemy. Well, bring it on!, as\
  \ they say. We are all aware that blasphemy is a splendid way to drum up publicity.\
  \ And Christian blasphemy is nice and safe, and wins plaudits for being \u201Cedgy\u201D\
  \ from the Guardian, unlike blasphemy against Islam, which gets you blown up or\
  \ beheaded and accused of being racist by the Guardian.\nThe main\u2014the only\u2014\
  reason I have devised this show, however, is as a pretext for the title Muammar's\
  \ Malm\xF6 Myrrh. That has a pleasing ring, does it not? The great thing about it\
  \ is that, however clearly and resoundingly you try to enunciate the words, you\
  \ still sound like a toothless inarticulate wretch.\n[2013-05-19]"
