text: "When I have finished writing my book of Brief, Brief Lives, I am going to embark\
  \ on a long-cherished project. This is Mr Key's Catalogue Of Everything In The Known\
  \ Universe, Arranged According To An Abstruse Taxonomic System Partly, But Not Wholly,\
  \ Related To The Standard Alphabet, Together With Fantastic And Occasionally Hysterical\
  \ Supplementary Passages Of Piercingly Acute Flimflam, And Several Diagrams With\
  \ Pointy Arrows, Wavy Lines, And Unseemly Smudges, The Whole Printed In Tiny Type\
  \ And With A Magnifying Glass Included For Ease Of Perusal.\nThough I have not yet\
  \ written a word of the text, I have made several smudges, with soot on blotting\
  \ paper, and while doing so have given much\u2014well, no, not much\u2014thought\
  \ to the abstruse taxonomic system. At the moment I am minded to begin the book\
  \ with geese, fireworks, and the Tet Offensive, though that may change as I delve\
  \ deeper into everything in the known universe.\nProspective publishers are not\
  \ beating a path to my door. I suspect they are intimidated, not so much by the\
  \ sheer bulk of the book\u2014it will be hefty!, hefty!\u2014but by the fact that\
  \ nobody is ever going to need to read anything else, ever, and book sales will\
  \ slump accordingly.\nBut first I must crack on with the Lives...\n[2014-02-23]"
