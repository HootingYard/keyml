text: 'Once upon a time there was a smelly castle. Boy, did it pong! The baron who
  lived there could not account for the reek. He was not a stinky person himself.
  Indeed, he bathed much more often than was usual in that time, in that land, and
  he also doused himself in rich and heady perfumes, brought to him from mysterious
  distant lands by itinerant perfumiers. So offended were some of these travellers
  by the hideous stench wafting through the castle that they could not bring themselves
  to cross the drawbridge. The baron would have to come out of his castle and meet
  them in a field to take possession of their latest scents and tinctures. He felt
  this was beneath his dignity, to have to come and haggle in a field like a peasant,
  but on the other hand it was quite a treat to be out in the fresh air for half an
  hour.

  The baron had tried everything to rid the smelly castle of its pong. He had the
  drains inspected. He scattered pot pourris hither and thither. He even called in
  a fumigation expert, or at least a man who announced himself as one. But all to
  no avail. The castle stank, it was as simple as that.
