text: "I put some sphagnum in a pot.\n  I boiled it 'til it was hot.\n  I spooned\
  \ it out onto a plate.\n  And then I sat me down to wait.\nI waited 'til the moss\
  \ was cold.\n  I did precisely as I'd been told\n  In a book of recipes for sphagnum\
  \ meals,\nDining Well On Moss And Eels.\nRather, a pamphlet, not a book.\n  By Dobson,\
  \ who claimed to be a cook\n  In the prefatory piece\n  He'd written to these recipes.\n\
  This poem, by F X Urg, is the sole reference in all world literature to Dobson's\
  \ semi-mythical recipe book. The titanic pamphleteer of the twentieth century always\
  \ denied having written it, and not even the most indefatigable of Dobsonists has\
  \ been able to find any trace of it, in either printed or manuscript form.\nIt would\
  \ thus be simple to dismiss the poem as one of F X Urg's lurid phantasies, were\
  \ it not that Dobson is on the record as having eaten both sphagnum moss and eels\
  \ for breakfast on innumerable occasions. In his pamphlet A Tally Of All The Breakfasts\
  \ I Have Tucked Into Over The Past Sixteen Years (out of print), Dobson regularly\
  \ mentions sphagnum and eels, sometimes in combination, as in this extract:\n15\
  \ June 1954. Breakfast today was eels stuffed with boiled and shredded sphagnum,\
  \ washed down with dandelion and burdock spiked with runny egg.\nIt is quite plausible,\
  \ then, that the out of print pamphleteer might at some point have turned his hand\
  \ to such a recipe book. But if he did, why did he so vehemently deny it? And his\
  \ denials were certainly vehement. A hot empurpled face, spitting, screeching, and\
  \ the jabbing of his fists at his interlocutor were common responses whenever Dobson\
  \ was asked about the existence of the book. Russell Hartyplus, for one, wisely\
  \ steered clear of the topic when he interviewed Dobson for an episode of his TV\
  \ series Interviews With Pamphleteers, contenting himself with questions about hot\
  \ air balloons, moles, and gas giants, the subjects of Dobson's three most recent\
  \ pamphlets, all now out of print.\nAn answer to the puzzle possibly lies in ferreting\
  \ out further information about the lurid phantasist F X Urg. This could prove problematic,\
  \ however, as the poem reproduced above is the only known trace of him in all world\
  \ literature.\n[2013-06-05]"
