  \ along the lines of \u201CGod in heaven, child, you won't get very far in life\
  \ if all you do is stand around dribbling all day!\u201D The thing is, they were\
  \ right, which is why you would be astonished if you had fun, or made a profit,\
  \ simply by dribbling.\nHowever, should you wish to pursue this activity as a career\
  \ option, here are some tips.\nOf course, an element of luck is essential in all\
  \ such career trajectories, but sooner or later one of your passers-by may well\
  \ be a top-flight television executive, from either the BBC or one of the independent\
  \ networks, and they will surely sign you up for your very own primetime show, where\
  \ you will be able to dispense with the cap and the bells and the capering and the\
  \ shoebox, and just face the camera and dribble, dribble, dribble.\n[2008-12-20]"
