text: "Having let the Archbishopric of Canterbury slip through my fingers, I am not\
  \ going to make the same mistake with the other big job now unexpectedly on offer.\
  \ George Entwistle's resignation after just fifty-four days at the helm means the\
  \ post of BBC Director General is vacant. As Leonard Cohen put it, \u201CI'm your\
  \ man\u201D.\nThe present BBC is a huge and bloated organisation, preposterously\
  \ so when we consider what it does. The clue is in the name: British Broadcasting\
  \ Corporation. It broadcasts programmes on the telly and the radio. That's all.\
  \ So let us gain some perspective. It is not governing a country or fighting a war\
  \ or sending a mission to Mars. (Someone on the Today programme this morning did\
  \ refer to the imminent \u201CStar Trek world of the 2020s\u201D, but that is a\
  \ topic for a separate postage.)\nI have no idea what all those hopeless hapless\
  \ BBC-lifer nonentities in the seemingly numberless tiers of management actually\
  \ do, and nor, I suspect, in their heart of hearts, do they. I would immediately\
  \ dispense with the lot of them. Do you know how ResonanceFM is run? There is a\
  \ benevolent dictator, assisted by one person who knows how all the technical gubbins\
  \ works and one person who makes sure they have enough programmes to fill the schedule.\
  \ And that's it. The BBC could easily be run on the same lines, perhaps doubling\
  \ up on the numbers of assistants to reflect that there is a TV arm as well as a\
  \ radio one.\nNow let us look in more detail at each of those.\nTelevision. I don't\
  \ know if you have read a tabloid newspaper recently. I have, and I can tell you\
  \ that a terrifying percentage of the content is related directly to television.\
  \ If you removed the TV-related stuff from the average tabloid you would be left\
  \ with a few flimsy pages. I think what this shows is that television has had a\
  \ lethal and degrading effect on the culture of the masses. Truly we live in an\
  \ age of pap. So my first instinct would be to shut down the television service\
  \ entirely. That, however, is probably an impossible dream, even for as dictatorial\
  \ a Director General as I intend to be. What would be feasible, however, is to scrap\
  \ all the current programming and show only Key-approved content. Call it elitism,\
  \ if you will, but I know I know best, and I am sure after a short while everyone\
  \ else will agree.\nThus, for example, if you had a choice between hour upon hour\
  \ of Celebrity Antique Cookery Car Jungle Challenge or a season of classic Googie\
  \ Withers films, which would you prefer? Not that you will be given the choice under\
  \ my dominion. It will be Googie all the way, every day! And when we have exhausted\
  \ the Googie canon we will show all of Jacques Rivette's films, and then Guy Maddin's,\
  \ on rotation. There are of course other approved film persons other than Googie\
  \ and Jacques and Guy, and they will get their slots.\nBut oi!, I hear you cry,\
  \ that is cinema, not television. Television is a separate and distinct medium in\
  \ its own right. To which I reply, maybe so, but there needs to be a moratorium\
  \ while we bash some sense back into the heads of the masses. After, say, ten years\
  \ of my limited schedule, it might be possible to reintroduce certain made-for-television\
  \ programmes, chiefly Scandinavian police dramas and a show dedicated entirely to\
  \ Dr Alan Statham from Green Wing.\nRadio. I mentioned ResonanceFM above, and it\
  \ seems to me the best thing to do is simply to adjust the current BBC wavelengths\
  \ so they broadcast Resonance instead. This would do wonders for the nation's morale.\
  \ As I would be in charge, there would of course be a channel dedicated wholly to\
  \ Hooting Yard On The Air. There are already hundreds of hours\u2019 worth of me\
  \ babbling into a microphone available as podcasts, so these could be put on an\
  \ ever-repeating loop.\nI would, however, retain two programmes from the current\
  \ BBC schedules, the shipping forecast and Farming Today. For the latter, the existing\
  \ roster of presenters would be ditched (ha ha!) and replaced by some proper peasants.\n\
  Other Activities. BBC persons witter on at length about a multi-platform approach.\
  \ Basically, all this means is making the TV and radio programmes available on computers\
  \ and laptops and iFaffs and other digital devices. All you need is a computer-literate\
  \ teenperson to sort that out.\nMy finest achievement, however, would be to resurrect\
  \ The Listener. Younger readers may be unaware that from 1929 to 1991 the BBC published\
  \ the best weekly periodical I have ever read. It was an intelligent general interest\
  \ magazine of the kind now absent from our newsagents\u2019 shelves. (Both The Spectator\
  \ and The New Statesman have a political axe to grind; The Listener didn't.) As\
  \ a teenperson, I used to read it every week from cover to cover, and learned more\
  \ from it than from any other single source. I knew the rot had set in when it was\
  \ closed down two decades ago, a decision I can still not forgive.\n\nIt is clear\
  \ from the above that I am the best possible Director General the BBC could possibly\
  \ have. I await \u201CLord\u201D Patten's call (assuming he is still in post at\
  \ the BBC Trust when you read this. If not, I'll take his job too, and I won't need\
  \ ennobling.)\n[2012-11-12]"
