text: "Tarleton, the amateur's amateur, had been missing for a fortnight when one\
  \ evening he came crashing through the door of his consulting rooms, twitching and\
  \ shattered.\n\u201CGood grief, Tarleton!\u201D cried his sidekick, companion, amanuensis\
  \ and consulting roommate, Not-Tarleton, \u201CWhere in blazes have you been?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI have been muffled, wallowing in the sink of vice that is a Limehouse opium\
  \ den, if you must know,\u201D said Tarleton, \u201CI was in pursuit of a man with\
  \ a twisted lip.\u201D\n\u201CI\u2026 I\u2026 corwumph!\u201D expostulated Not-Tarleton,\
  \ who resembled, in both manner and appearance, Old Wilkie from Linbury Court, so\
  \ much so, indeed, that we shall hereinafter refer to him as Old Wilkie in order\
  \ to avoid confusion with his near-namesake Tarleton.\n\u201CCorwumph! away to your\
  \ heart's content. You know my methods,\u201D said Tarleton, \u201CThe man with\
  \ the twisted lip was in possession of pelf. I could tell it was pelf because he\
  \ carried it in a sack slung over his shoulder with the word PELF stencilled upon\
  \ it in big black block capitals. I pursued him through the streets and mews and\
  \ boulevards. He was hot under the collar. I dogged his every footstep. The sky\
  \ was overcast. He entered the stews of Limehouse and still I followed him. He scuttled\
  \ down an insalubrious alleyway. It was a nest of opium dens. Mayhew surveyed them\
  \ at one time or another, I am sure.\u201D\n\u201CAnd?\u201D shouted Old Wilkie.\n\
  \u201CAnd I spent a fortnight in an opium-addled daze, from which I have only recently\
  \ emerged. The man with the twisted lip was nowhere to be seen. But while we were\
  \ both sprawled upon divans in the Oriental hellhole, I affixed to his ankle, unbeknown\
  \ to him, a tracking device, which works with light reflecting booster technology\
  \ developed by L'Oreal. I am going to eat some kippers, and then I shall find out\
  \ where he is, with his sack o\u2019 pelf. Having located him, I will run him to\
  \ ground. If he digs himself into a burrow in the ground, like the narrator of Rogue\
  \ Male by Geoffrey Household, I will entrap him, as did Quive-Smith, but I shall\
  \ ensure I do not meet Quive-Smith's sticky end.\u201D\n\u201CBut how, Tarleton?\
  \ How?\u201D screamed Old Wilkie.\n\u201CBy wearing this metal head-harness,\u201D\
  \ said Tarleton, donning a metal head-harness, \u201CIf the man with the twisted\
  \ lip tries to kill me by shooting an arrow between my eyes from an improvised crossbow,\
  \ it will ping harmlessly against the metal.\u201D\n\u201CI\u2026 I\u2026 corwumph!\u201D\
  \ screeched Old Wilkie, \u201CWas the head-harness also developed by L'Oreal?\u201D\
  \nBut answer came there none, for the amateur's amateur was already gone.\nHe returned\
  \ some weeks later, twitching and shattered.\n\u201CAs soon as I have eaten some\
  \ kippers, I shall apprise you of my doings,\u201D he announced, and as soon as\
  \ he had eaten some kippers, he apprised Old Wilkie of his doings. Being, among\
  \ other things, his amanuensis, Old Wilkie wrote down what he heard, and thus it\
  \ is that we, too, are apprised of Tarleton's doings, long after he ate some kippers.\n\
  It seems that, shortly before seeing the man with the twisted lip hauling his sack\
  \ of pelf along the streets and mews and boulevards, Tarleton had been approached\
  \ by Old Farmer Frack. The mad old farmer was distraught, because his eerie barn\
  \ had been broken into and all his farm implements and equipment, stored therein,\
  \ his clodding mell and two Kentish binding rakes and a disc coulter and a subsoil\
  \ pulveriser plough and a potato grading shovel and five Morris's turnip fly catchers\
  \ and two hand-cranked threshers and a seed rusky and an automatic sheaf tying mechanism\
  \ and a whin bruiser and Keevil's cheese-making apparatus and a mouldbaert and fan\
  \ tackle and chogger and a Nellis fork and a plough graip and half a dozen liquid\
  \ manure pumps and a pair of hedger's gloves and Gilbert's improved iron sack holder\
  \ and four American butter separators and a cauterising iron and a mouth cramp and\
  \ a charlock slasher and Blurton's tumbling cheese rack and eight barley hummellers\
  \ and an adze and a curd agitator and grinding stones and Drummond's iron harvest\
  \ sickle and a dairymaid's yoke and a clod knocker and Biddell's scarifier and Fowler's\
  \ self-adjusting anchor and a bitting iron and fifteen creels and two caschroms\
  \ and a dung hack and a Crees lactator and five horn trainers and a fagging stick\
  \ and a pea hook and two Lipmann glass stoppers and a trenching fork and Gilbee's\
  \ horse hoe and a drain ladle and hackle prongs and a flax brake and Hall's smut\
  \ machine and a heckling board and three flauchter spades and a hay tedder and an\
  \ Ivel three-wheeled petrol-powered machine and Finlayson's grubber and a potato\
  \ riddle and four root pulpers and paring mattocks and Morton's revolving harrow\
  \ and Samuelson's cake-breaking machine and a foot pick and sheep netting and two\
  \ oilcake crushers and Reade's patent syringe and various instruments for destroying\
  \ moles and a barrow turnip slicer and a Paul net and a Sandwich clean-sweep hay-loader\
  \ and probangs and castrating shears and Hannaford's wet wheat pickling machine\
  \ and a scutching board and a swath turner and a plank-drag harrow, had been stolen.\n\
  Tarleton put two and two together. It was blindingly obvious that the man with the\
  \ twisted lip was the thief. He had sold Old Farmer Frack's barn's-worth of booty\
  \ to a fence, and put the pelf in his sack. It was, then, a simple matter of finding\
  \ the fence and bludgeoning him to death using one of the instruments for destroying\
  \ moles, and restoring to the mad old farmer his rightful possessions.\n\u201CJust\
  \ one question, Tarleton,\u201D said Old Wilkie, \u201CThese various instruments\
  \ for destroying moles. Were any of them developed by L'Oreal?\u201D\nBut answer\
  \ came there none, for the amateur's amateur, his mouth stuffed with some more kippers,\
  \ had fled to a Limehouse opium den, to wallow in vice, sprawled on a divan.\n[2017-12-27]"
