text: "Some time ago, in his Dabbler Diary, Brit wrote about chickens:\nDo you ever\
  \ worry about the scale of chicken slaughter in the world? Sometimes at Asda, contemplating\
  \ a pack of six chicken thighs, for example, I think, well that's three chickens\
  \ that have laid down their meagre little lives right there\u2026 And there are\
  \ so many packs on the shelves. And so many Asdas in the country. Not to mention\
  \ Tescos and the rest. Then think of all the KFCs across the globe, dishing out\
  \ bucketfuls of legs and wings 24/7. And of course we cannot exclude my beloved\
  \ Nando's\u2019 role in this unimaginable daily massacre.\n\u201CBest not to think\
  \ about it really\u201D he concludes. But I have been thinking about it, for eighteen\
  \ months now. Not continuously, to the exclusion of any other thoughts in my bonce,\
  \ but every now and then, every now and then. And whenever I think about it, I find\
  \ myself thinking, what if the chickens were in charge?\nImagine that a phenomenon\
  \ beloved of sci-fi writers occurred\u2014a miasmic gas sweeping across the globe,\
  \ or a befuddling magnetic reversal\u2014and the result was the empowerment of chickens.\
  \ Perhaps their brains would be transformed and they would become hyperintelligent,\
  \ or\u2014more terrifyingly\u2014they would remain just as stupid as Werner Herzog\
  \ thinks they are but grow to monstrous size. Then they would wreak their revenge\
  \ upon humanity. The unimaginable daily slaughter of chickens at the hands of humankind\
  \ would become the unimaginable daily slaughter of humans at the talons of chickenkind.\n\
  Such a scenario is equally horrifying if we imagine a reversal of our size relative\
  \ to any small creature, particularly the allegedly \u201Ccute\u201D ones. Look\
  \ carefully at a squirrel. Now ponder how things would be if you were the size of\
  \ the squirrel and the squirrel the size of you. Do you honestly think it would\
  \ toss peanuts in your path for you to squirrel away?\nThis is the stuff of nightmares,\
  \ and of fat airport bookstall bestsellers and interminable blockbuster film franchises.\
  \ Revenge Of The Chickens 4, or Squirrel Holocaust 7. Perhaps Brit is right, and\
  \ it is best not to think about it.\n[2015-01-10]"
