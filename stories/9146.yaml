text: "His frostbitten limbs. Sappho in the doldrums. Bad gas and forts. If these\
  \ phrases do not stir you, you are clearly not a devotee of Urbane Geistige Geist,\
  \ who was born one hundred years ago today. If, on the other hand, your brain lit\
  \ up like a beacon on reading those words, you will be one of that little band who\
  \ rightly acknowledge Geist as a key figure in twentieth century popular music.\n\
  \u2018Popular\u2019 is perhaps not the most appropriate word. Although he worked\
  \ within such fields as jazz, folk, rock, hootcha, pop, and swing, Geist's music\
  \ never won mass acceptance. He was only ever a cult figure, but it is to be hoped\
  \ that, with the celebration of his centenary, the ears of the world can be opened\
  \ to his extraordinary accomplishment. Who would have thought that an obscure cadet\
  \ in the Bolivian army would become\u2014in the words of one perceptive commentator\u2014\
  a cross between Yoko Ono, Xavier Cugat, and Mark E Smith?\nWe need not dwell here\
  \ on Geist's military career, except to note that he learned to play his first instrument\u2014\
  the glockenspiel\u2014when he came under the wing of the legendary Bolivian army\
  \ glockenspiel instructor, Captain Enrique Finisterre Belbacqau, a man of whom it\
  \ has been said that if he did not exist, the staff of the Bolivian Army Glockenspiel\
  \ Training School would have had to invent him. (One body of opinion attests that\
  \ that is precisely what they did, creating a fictional character not unlike the\
  \ supposed agent George Kaplan in Hitchcock's North By Northwest, for whom the Cary\
  \ Grant character Roger Thornhill is mistaken. This theory has never satisfactorily\
  \ answered the obvious question: if Belbacqua did not exist, who exactly did teach\
  \ Geist his formidable glockenspiel technique?)\nAfter being thrown out of the Bolivian\
  \ army because of his flawed cadetship and shape-shifting, Geist hitch-hiked to\
  \ Paraguay, where he soon fell in with a criminal gang who, when they weren't cutting\
  \ throats and pushing widows into the paths of oncoming trains, toted their piccolos\
  \ and banjos around the market squares of provincial towns, playing an infectious\
  \ combination of bluegrass and light opera. This raggle-taggle peasant band became,\
  \ improbably enough, the first incarnation of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity.\n\
  There has been much speculation regarding Geist's lifelong insistence that the groups\
  \ he led, no matter how often he changed personnel, must always go by the same appellation,\
  \ sometimes as just The Crooked Timber Of Humanity, and sometimes as Bolivian Army\
  \ Cadet Urbane Geistige Geist And The Crooked Timber Of Humanity. He took the name\
  \ from Immanuel Kant's observation that \u201Cout of the crooked timber of humanity,\
  \ no straight thing was ever made\u201D, and it is tempting to see this as a less\
  \ than subtle comment on that very first line-up of evil-hearted robbers and violent\
  \ thugs. (Incidentally, Dobson wrote an out of print pamphlet entitled Nomenclature\
  \ of Paraguayan Bandit Musicians & Soviet Collective Farm Administrators Compared,\
  \ in which he proposed that Geist arrived at the name during a tarot reading. This\
  \ is piffle.)\nSadly, no recording exists of that very first group. By the time\
  \ the LP Pelf And Cant was released, with its magnificent trumpet-driven melodies,\
  \ all but one of the original band were either dead, imprisoned, or hiding in the\
  \ hills. Geist was supremely unconcerned at the almost total loss of his group,\
  \ demonstrating for the first time the ruthlessness which was to make him so feared.\
  \ As Dave Pod puts it in his Oral History Of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity, \u201C\
  You could always tell when someone had done their time with Geist's band. Their\
  \ hair was prematurely white, most of their teeth had fallen out, and they walked,\
  \ if they were able to walk at all, on spavined legs. They trembled uncontrollably,\
  \ burst into tears every five minutes, and were unable to achieve closure on their\
  \ issues despite extensive, and expensive, therapy\u201D. Pod's own band became\
  \ a sort of rest home for ejected Crooked Timber, though artistically he is not\
  \ fit to lick Geist's boots. Nonetheless, one should not overlook the fact that\
  \ by throwing in their lot with Pod, the wrecked survivors of The Crooked Timber\
  \ Of Humanity were given a chance to play at the Eurovision Song Contest, something\
  \ that was unlikely to happen under Geist's iron rule. (He did, notoriously, attempt\
  \ to enter the competition when he kidnapped Kathy Kirby, but an international police\
  \ operation foiled his reprehensible, if entertaining, scheme. Many of us would\
  \ have given our eye teeth to witness that superb twenty-six strong line-up of the\
  \ band, all accordions, trombones and pounding drums, backing the British songstress\
  \ in the specially-written song Black Rubber Beelzebub.)\nHis Frostbitten Limbs.\
  \ Sappho In The Doldrums. Bad Gas And Forts. This was the trio of LPs that, for\
  \ many of us, cemented Geist's reputation. Released within the space of a single\
  \ month, containing between them no fewer than one hundred songs, shanties and pop-madrigals,\
  \ they still stand as one of the commanding achievements of twentieth century music\
  \ in any genre, vibrant, vivacious, vivid and even, at times, deceptively cloth-eared.\
  \ The story of those fractious recording sessions has been told many times, notably\
  \ in the memoir by lutenist Julian Beam, one of the few band members who managed\
  \ to remain in favour with Geist and appear on all three LPs, although his contribution\
  \ to Bad Gas And Forts consists of a single string-pluck in the middle eight of\
  \ The Gregory Peck Protein Imbalance Song. By the time The Crooked Timber Of Humanity\
  \ appeared on the television show Pop Fabulousness! to promote its release as a\
  \ single, Beam had been \u201Cconsigned to the outer darkness\u201D as Geist always\
  \ put it, and was hawking his lute-playing skills at a variety of seaside resorts\
  \ in exchange for the price of a cake or bun for his dinner. By the time he came\
  \ to write his book, his arm was withered, his prematurely white hair was infested\
  \ with beetles, and he had all the telltale signs of an ex-Geistist.\nWhen we recorded\
  \ the songs on side one of His Frostbitten Limbs, wrote Beam, Geist had devised\
  \ some new ideas. He made us sleep in tents on the sloping roof of the studio, wear\
  \ bells on lanyards around our necks, and force fed us a grey, tasteless paste of\
  \ his own recipe. Every member of the band ballooned in weight and the constant\
  \ clanging of those bells sorely tried the engineer, who had to erase their clamour\
  \ from the tapes. The tents could not be properly secured to the concrete roof,\
  \ and there were violent gales throughout the month, so we got little sleep. Only\
  \ the hammer and tongs players, all six of them, were exempt from this regime. They\
  \ were put up in a luxury hotel and taken to exciting sporting events during breaks.\
  \ Geist himself spent most of the sessions smoking his pipe and making lascivious\
  \ phone calls to a floozie.\nElsewhere, Beam declared that no recording session\
  \ had given him such great joy, and he continued to idolise Geist for the remainder\
  \ of his life, until the day his pitiful wasted body collapsed in a heap in a post\
  \ office near the Blister Lane Bypass, and he was pronounced dead. Reportedly, his\
  \ dying words were \u201CUrbane Geistige Geist is a profound and matchless genius\
  \ and everyone should devote their lives to his work, as I have been honoured to\
  \ do, despite the feeble and broken carcass you see expiring before your eyes on\
  \ this post office floor near the Blister Lane Bypa\u2026..\u201D\nGeist himself\
  \ was to die within a week. He had recorded over one hundred and twenty LPs, played\
  \ concerts in almost every country on earth, won the esteem of a dedicated troop\
  \ of followers, and been appointed as a Chevalier De Leo Sayer In Perpetuity. Countless\
  \ times it had been foretold that he would meet his end at the hands of a vengeful,\
  \ dismissed member of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity. Fingers were pointed, even\
  \ while the bandleader was still alive, at bassoonist Ned Nightshade, the man who\
  \ had played such a wonderful solo on a reworking of The Snapping Turtles Of Old\
  \ Cadiz, yet whose heart had shrivelled and rotted when Geist sent him packing.\
  \ Suspicions were raised, too, about Hetty and Ingmar, the Norwegian teenagers who\
  \ sang on over a dozen LPs but were sacked from the band when Geist got himself\
  \ into a flap about something or other.\nIn the event, the maestro was not murdered.\
  \ One damp Sunday he was wheeling a barrow of nettles over bracken, whistling the\
  \ showstopper from his stage musical version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs, when a bee\
  \ landed on his hat. Geist had always worn bee-proof hats until this fateful day,\
  \ when a mix-up at the dry-cleaners\u2019 found him for once in his life unprotected\
  \ from bees. In a panic, he stopped whistling and flew into convulsions. His head\
  \ flushed purple, he gasped for breath, and his tongue became puffy. He did not\
  \ remove his hat, the fool. He became snagged in the bracken, miles from civilisation,\
  \ and by the time the bee flew back to its hive, Geist had become hopelessly entangled.\
  \ Unable to free himself, he lay on his back, staring at the sky, and sang Roll\
  \ Along Covered Wagon, over and over again, until his last breath.\nRoll along covered\
  \ wagon, roll along, to the turn of your wheels I sing a song, city ladies may be\
  \ fine, but give me that girl of mine, roll along covered wagon, roll along. Going\
  \ home covered wagon going home, for this cowboy was never born to roam, \u2018\
  long the road that doesn't change, to that old bar twenty range, roll along covered\
  \ wagon, roll along. Yipee-teeyi, old timers, heading for your ranch house door,\
  \ yipee-teeyi, old timers, corral me so I'll never stray no more. Roll along covered\
  \ wagon, roll along. Come along old pal, let's get going. Roll along.\n[This piece\
