text: "George Eliot said that a happy home life was a necessity for her to write.\
  \ It seems the same was true for Dobson, who churned out all those innumerable out\
  \ of print pamphlets while living in domestic bliss with Marigold Chew. But was\
  \ happiness indeed the spur for his indefatigable pamphleteering? Quite the opposite\
  \ was the case with Emanuel Swedenborg, as we learn from Eric John Dingwall. In\
  \ Very Peculiar People\_: Portrait Studies In The Queer, The Abnormal And The Uncanny\
  \ (1950) Mr Dingwall has a paragraph which ends superbly:\n\u201CAs the years went\
  \ by Swedenborg became more energetic than ever. His passion for women still tormented\
  \ him, for, since the rejection of his suit by the young Emerentia Polhem about\
  \ 1717, he apparently contracted no other alliance. There is no doubt that his failure\
  \ to win her hand had affected him deeply, but he quickly steeled himself against\
  \ allowing emotion to upset his work. He promptly published a pamphlet on the manufacture\
  \ of tinplate.\u201D\nWhat this might indicate about the home life of our own dear\
  \ Dobson is worthy of speculation.\n[2010-06-12]"
