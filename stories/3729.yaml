text: "Blodgett, of course, was often mistaken for a killer robot, whenever he went\
  \ rampaging around remote rural airfields and landing strips dressed in an outfit\
  \ of tin foil and sheet metal with plastic, bakelite, and glass adornments. Why,\
  \ might one ask, did he make such a spectacle of himself, repeatedly?\nLuckily,\
  \ we have evidence from Blodgett himself. He was interviewed on the television chat\
  \ show Let's Talk To People Who Rampage Around Remote Rural Airfields And Landing\
  \ Strips!, which was screened on the Swivel-eyed Nutcase TV Channel for several\
  \ months in the early 1970s. I have scoured YouTube for a clip without success,\
  \ but a transcript exists, which I got hold of through bribery, subterfuge, and\
  \ threats of violence. Alas, it is incomplete, but a fragment is better than nothing.\n\
  Cheesy Host\_: Our next guest will probably surprise you, because it's a killer\
  \ robot! [Chortles.] Not really! It's just Blodgett, in an outfit that makes him\
  \ look like a killer robot! Give him a big hand!\n[Tumultuous applause.]\nCheesy\
  \ Host\_: Welcome to the show, Blodgett.\nBlodgett\_: Yava Hoosita!\nCheesy Host\_\
  : Ho ho ho! Indeed! I think what our lovely audience want to know is why you rampage\
  \ around remote rural airfields and landing strips dressed like that.\n[Tumultuous\
  \ hoots of agreement from the audience.]\nBlodgett\_: Well, Sacheverell, as you\
  \ know, we are under serious threat from Communists. Stalin may be dead these twenty\
  \ years, but the Soviet beast has never been in such rude health. We could be overrun\
  \ by the Red Hordes tomorrow, unless we take every precaution possible.\n[Applause\
  \ both tumultuous and thunderous, save from a beardy cardigan-wearing Open University\
  \ lecturer.]\nCheesy Host\_: We all agree with that, Blodgett! But how does your\
  \ rampaging around remote rural airfields and landing strips dressed as a killer\
  \ robot help the fight against international Communism?\nBlodgett\_: I have a one-word\
  \ answer to that, Sacheverell\u2026\nAnnoyingly, the transcript ends there.\n[2010-01-23]"
