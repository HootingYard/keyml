  \ In France (1973):\n\u201CParis always had the best riots. Those of May 1968 marked\
  \ the clear emergence of a new criminal class, that of the Western World's countless\
  \ superfluous undergraduates. Our own welfare kids had done a fair amount of marching\
  \ this way and that and shouting \u2018Fascist!\u2019. This word they had no doubt\
  \ picked up from their Left-wing parents, for none of them had been born when fascism\
  \ ended at least in Western Europe. One kind of seasonal marching had ended when\
  \ the actress Vanessa Redgrave decided, doubtless on doctor's orders, to stop planting\
  \ her fair bottom on the cold stones of Trafalgar Square. The French students had\
  \ heard of Freud and Marx, whose names had bored Britons of my generation to a state\
  \ verging on hysteria before the war but had somehow skipped Paris, where they had\
  \ their own anarchist tradition. In R\xE9gis Debray, they had a little Che Guevara\
  \ of their own, and for some reason they had paid more attention than our own young\
  \ to the government-organised wrecking or cultural revolution in China the previous\
  \ year\u2026\n\u201CAt least on the routes of marches, public lavatory attendants\
  \ get a chance to start cleaning up as soon as the procession has passed, while\
  \ in general Pop fans congregate in the open air, so that the dead grass can afterwards\
  \ be sprayed. The Paris undergraduates blocked up the drains in theatres and university\
  \ buildings until the stench became too much even for them. Then they moved out\
  \ and left it all to the cleaners and decorators. Even now atavistically respectful\
  \ of the plumbing, German and Anglo-Saxon undergraduates also occupied fine premises,\
  \ but in smaller numbers and for shorter periods.\u201D\n[2010-05-21]"
