text: 'Things have been pretty quiet here at Hooting Yard, and they are going to be
  even quieter over the next few days as I head off for another jaunt in the cause
  of art. This will probably be the last one, at least for the foreseeable future,
  so when I return early next week I shall resume my usual practice of hunkering down
  in my Diogenesian Barrel of Reclusion and sending forth sweeping paragraphs of majestic
  prose to an eager, panting populace..


  Meanwhile, over at The Dabbler, you can read a note on the death of Margaret Thatcher.
