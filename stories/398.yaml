text: "There is much in the news these days about the credit crunch, but this should\
  \ not lead us to neglect many other important crunches. I sometimes worry that less\
  \ attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality\
  \ of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favourite of headline writers\
  \ and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I \u201Csometimes\u201D worry\
  \ about this. If truth be told, my fretfulness about neglected crunches is starting\
  \ to consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was standing upon\
  \ a bridge, staring off into the distance, buffeted by a gale, and all I could think\
  \ of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of my preferred crunches\
  \ off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections\u2014or, to be\
  \ more precise, my people don't have any connections with their people\u2014so it's\
  \ not as if I can just send a few metal tapping machine messages to selected newspaper\
  \ crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches. Would that\
  \ I could! What I did instead, yesterday, was to trudge disconsolately home and\
  \ to spend a fruitful few hours studying Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The\
  \ Bumper Book Of Crunches. I can recommend this fantastic, and very fat, book to\
  \ anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch. It is packed\
  \ with crunch-related facts, anecdotage, illustrations, diagrams, and even its very\
  \ own cleverly-crafted crunchiness.\n[2008-04-11]"
