text: "We are five friends, one day we came out of a house one after the other, first\
  \ one came and placed himself beside the gate, then the second came, or rather he\
  \ glided through the gate like a little ball of quicksilver, and placed himself\
  \ near the first one, then came the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. We were\
  \ like a five-sided die. Most dice have six sides, or faces, I think, but we were\
  \ like one of those five-sided dice you used to be able to buy at Mr Fatso's Unseemly\
  \ Joke Shop. There is an old canard that a five-sided die is a geometric impossibility.\
  \ Well, try telling that to Mr Fatso. He will spit on your shoes and push one of\
  \ his novelty spiders up your nose.\nWe did not come out of the house voluntarily.\
  \ We were turfed out, one by one, by its paterfamilias. Several hours earlier, shortly\
  \ after the risen sun brought a blush of golden loveliness to the burgeoning day\
  \ (Dinsey), we had barged into the house purporting to proselytise. We claimed to\
  \ be Adepts of the Order of Sibodnedwab, an esoteric order devoted to esoterica,\
  \ spiritual perfection, and robbery. On the pretext of converting the occupants\
  \ to our cause, we hoped to snaffle items such as kettles, cushions, and coathangers.\n\
  They were a\u2014very wholesome\u2014family of four, Pa and Ma and Little Gus and\
  \ Little Gertrude. We kept them entranced by chalking an esoteric design upon the\
  \ carpet, babbling incoherent yet strangely compelling gibberish, and summoning,\
  \ from a plume of smoke, the jewel-encrusted toad god Alf. Everything was going\
  \ swimmingly until one of us\u2014I won't say who\u2014got carried away and pushed\
  \ one of Mr Fatso's novelty spiders up Little Gus's nose. His Pa became enraged.\
  \ He was wholesome but also a champion wrestler, as big and broad as a big broad\
  \ bear\u2014see Colour Plate XIV in Snit's Picture Book Of Bears. That will give\
  \ you an idea of who we were dealing with.\nOr not dealing with. One by one, Pa\
  \ picked us up by the scruff of the neck and hoicked us out of the house. We came\
  \ away with nothing. Now we are gathered at the gate, the five of us, like a five-sided\
  \ die, wondering what to do next.\n\u201CLet us repair to an ice cream parlour!\u201D\
  \ cries Ringo. I ought to explain that we are each named after a Beatle. That means\
  \ four of us have fixed names, while the fifth is known variously as Stu or Brian\
  \ or George (the other one) or Mal or Yoko, depending upon which lengthy and pointless\
  \ bit of conjecture gleaned from a half-century's-worth of so-called rock journalism\
  \ is uppermost in our minds at any one time.\nUsually we like to engage in lengthy\
  \ and pointless arguments, particularly when it is Ringo calling the shots, but\
  \ this morning we all agree that ice cream sounds like a capital idea. After all,\
  \ was it not Perkins who wrote \u201Ca choc ice is always a consolation\u201D?\n\
  So off we toddle, the five of us, towards the nearest ice cream parlour, as the\
  \ hands of the clock creep inexorably towards that position where they are both\
  \ pointing in an identical, decisive vertical. There is a name for that precise\
  \ alignment. You can look it up in Hodgepang's The Positions Of Clock-Hands And\
  \ Their Implications.\nAs we pass a splurge of binsey poplars, one of us\u2014I\
  \ won't say who\u2014looks back and sees, springing along the lane in pursuit, the\
  \ jewel-encrusted toad god Alf. He is such a nuisance! Years ago, we hired him from\
  \ Mr Fatso's Unseemly Joke Shop, thinking he would add a dash of panache to our\
  \ Order of Sibodnedwab capers. And he did, but he never leaves us alone, when for\
  \ example we want to go and eat choc ices. We stopped paying Mr Fatso his rental\
  \ fee long ago, but the toad god still follows us about. Is he a toad god or a toad\
  \ demon? No matter how he pouts his lips we push him away with our elbows, but however\
  \ much we push him away, back he comes.\nThe first sentence, and the last, were\
  \ translated from the German by Tania and James Stern. Everything in between was\
  \ not.\n[2018-03-15]"
