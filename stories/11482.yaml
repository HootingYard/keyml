text: "There is a song by Tanya Donelly's group Belly called \u201CSlow Dog\u201D\
  . I do not think I had ever appreciated how slow a dog could be until yesterday,\
  \ when I saw, walking along the pavement, an exceedingly slow dog, attached to a\
  \ leash one end of which was held firmly by the dog's owner, who was walking at\
  \ an equally, and arrestingly, slow pace. In fact the pair of them were so slow\
  \ that at first glance I thought they were immobile, posing on the pavement in a\
  \ tableau vivant, as if to illustrate the subject \u201CPerson With Dog\u201D. On\
  \ further inspection, however, it became clear that they were both walking along,\
  \ but imperceptibly, imperceptibly.\nI am not familiar with all the different breeds\
  \ of dog in the world but in this instance I am prepared to go out on a limb and\
  \ state, clearly and decisively, that the dog was a mastiff.\nI passed them by and\
  \ went about my business, a series of errands which took me, in turn, to a tobacconist,\
  \ an ironmongery, and a post office. Coming out of the post office, I saw something\
  \ across the road which defied description. Nevertheless, fresh from my triumph\
  \ at identifying a mastiff, among innumerable dog types, I am going to attempt to\
  \ describe it. It was indescribably nondescript. That being so, I paid it no further\
  \ attention, turned on my heel, and made my way home.\nWhen I passed the slow dog\
  \ and its master, they had progressed perhaps an inch or two along the pavement.\n\
  Home, I decided to listen to the Belly record. Tanya Donelly sings that her slow\
  \ dog has \u201Csee-through skin, the kind of skin you can see through\u201D. This\
  \ was not the case with the slow mastiff I saw, so she must have been singing about\
  \ a different dog entirely. It would be interesting to know which one was the slower.\n\
