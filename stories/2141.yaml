text: "I think the time has come for me to acquire a team of naked somersaulting emissaries\u2026\
  \nIn 589, a man went insane after being surrounded by flies in a forest near Arles.,\
  \ in France; two years later, he dressed himself in animal skins and made his way\
  \ down to Gevaudon, in the Cevennes, declaring that he was Christ, and that he had\
  \ the power to heal the sick\u2026 He began to accumulate an army of followers,\
  \ which reached three thousand, and towns they approached were asked to acknowledge\
  \ that he was Christ\u2014which most of them did to avoid trouble. Approaching the\
  \ town of La Puy, he quartered his army in halls and churches, and sent naked messengers\
  \ to announce his arrival to Bishop Aurelius.\nWhen the bishop saw these emissaries\
  \ turning somersaults, he had no doubt that they were inspired by the devil, so,\
  \ hiding his disgust, he sent some of his men to welcome the man who called himself\
  \ Christ. They bowed as if to kiss the messiah's knees, then dragged him to the\
  \ ground and stabbed him to death. Without their leader, the followers quickly dispersed\u2026\
  \ but St Gregory of Tours, who records the story, adds that the messiah's followers\
  \ continued to believe in him until the day they died.\nFrom The Devil's Party\_\
  : A History Of Charlatan Messiahs by Colin Wilson (2000)\nWilson, who knocks out\
  \ books at a Pebbleheadian rate, can't be bothered to provide us with footnotes\
  \ and references (other than that allusion to St Gregory of Tours). I think by \u201C\
  Gevaudon\u201D he means G\xC3\xA9vaudan, which, intriguingly, was terrorised by\
  \ man-eating wolf-like creatures between 1764 and 1767. Could it be that, clothed\
  \ in his animal skins, the fly-maddened Christ returned after twelve hundred years\
  \ as the Beast of \_G\xE9vaudan? I suspect this is highly likely, for as we all\
  \ know, the Lord moves in mysterious ways His flies to swat away wonders to perform.\n\
