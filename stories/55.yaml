text: "One morning Tiny Enid awoke from uneasy dreams with a sense of tremendous urgency\
  \ related to potatoes. She was based in Winnipeg at the time, and had taken a room\
  \ in a motel of undoubted seediness. \u201CI could not pinpoint the reasons for\
  \ my sense of breathless urgency on that grim March morning,\u201D she wrote, many\
  \ years later, in her Memoirs, \u201CAll I knew was that potatoes had something\
  \ to do with it.\u201D\nThe heroic young adventuress eschewed the motel breakfast,\
  \ a Winnipeg-style egg \u2018n\u2019 dough platter, sneaking out of a side entrance\
  \ to avoid the man with the twisted lip at the front desk. The city was still new\
  \ to her, and she had yet to locate any of the potato-related premises she felt\
  \ such a tremendous urgency to visit. She limped across the plaza to her rented\
  \ booster car and threw off its tarpaulin in one elegant sweep. Tiny Enid had been\
  \ practising her elegant sweeping arm movements for some weeks, and the superb elegance\
  \ with which she swept the tarpaulin off the car won her a round of applause from\
  \ a nearby line of patient pastry persons queuing outside a pastry shop.\nBefore\
  \ revving up the engine of her booster car, Tiny Enid tramped over to the queue.\
  \ She wanted to find out if she would sense an aura of potato urgency here, so close\
  \ to her motel. It was possible, after all, that among the pastries sold by the\
  \ pastry shop could be pastries with a potato filling. Was that urgency that cracked\
  \ her awake a premonition that a Winnipeg-based criminal mad person had poisoned\
  \ the potato pastries? If so, it would make sense for her to be bang on the scene\
  \ rather than having to speed around the city, lost, unnerved, and not knowing quite\
  \ what she was seeking, nor why. So many of the adventures of the tiny adventuress\
  \ had begun from these moments of curious intuition.\nBut it was still early in\
  \ the day, and the pastry shop proprietor had not yet hoisted the shutters, hence\
  \ the queue. Tiny Enid was hopeless at small talk, and she was at a loss how to\
  \ engage with the still-clapping queue which was so impressed with the elegance\
  \ of her sweeping arm movements. She pulled her sprightly black gold green crushed\
  \ crepe hat down low, and pretended an interest in pebbles piled close to the pastry\
  \ shop shutters. If her instincts were correct, she must be first into the shop\
  \ when the shutters went up, before a poor innocent Winnipegite was felled by a\
  \ poisoned potato pastry pie. Tiny Enid was a girl of impeccable manners, and she\
  \ flushed with shame in anticipation of having to push aside the unkempt hobbledehoy\
  \ who was first in the queue and who looked as if he had not eaten for a month.\n\
  Luckily, as the pastry shop proprietor appeared with a hook on the end of a wooden\
  \ pole with which by some shenanigans he hoisted the shutters, there was a distraction.\
  \ Over by the statue of prominent Winnipegite Elias Conklin, who had been the city's\
  \ mayor in 1881, a swarm of killer bees appeared out of the blue and set upon a\
  \ defenceless old woman wearing her widow's weeds. The massed buzzing of the bees\
  \ was nauseatingly loud, and the reaction of the pastry shop queue was instantaneous.\
  \ Even the starving hobbledehoy forgot his grumbling belly as the line broke up,\
  \ sprinting over to the Conklin statue flailing impromptu bee-scarifiers.\nOur tiny\
  \ heroine took the opportunity to sneak into the pastry shop. Thumping the proprietor\
  \ in the guts with her girly bludgeon, she incapacitated him with a few kicks to\
  \ the head, swiftly located behind the counter every single piping hot pastry with\
  \ a potato ingredient, and stuffed the lot of them into a canvas sack. She dragged\
  \ the sack over to her rented booster car, chucked it into the boot, and sped away,\
  \ just in time, for the killer bees had been confounded, the widow woman was safe,\
  \ and the patient pastry people were heading back to the pastry shop with coinage\
  \ clutched in their fists.\nAn hour or so later, having dumped the canvas sack of\
  \ potato pastries into the river at the Forks, where the Red River meets the Assiniboine,\
  \ and then driven around until she found verdant parkland, Tiny Enid slumped onto\
  \ a tuffet, dusted off her sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat, and lit\
  \ one of her high tar Paraguayan cigarettes. Soon, she knew, she would have to hunt\
  \ down the criminal mad person and bash them about, but for now, the world could\
  \ take a pause, and she could sit on her tuffet and smoke and watch the coots and\
  \ moorhens for whom a Winnipeg pond was home.\n[2007-02-17]"
