text: "It is a rule of thumb that in any egg-based pudding discussion, at some point\
  \ the phrase \u201Cover-egging the pudding\u201D will be deployed, whether or not\
  \ it is pertinent.\nIt is entirely conceivable that you have absolutely no idea\
  \ what I am talking about, so to clarify matters for the dull-witted I shall give\
  \ an example of a snatch of dialogue from a fairly routine egg-based pudding discussion.\
  \ This is not something I have made up, woven out of whole cloth from the fuming\
  \ phantasms of my inner head, but a genuine extract from an egg-based pudding discussion\
  \ I tape-recorded especially that I might transcribe it for an eventuality such\
  \ as the present one. I hope all this is crystal clear.\nSnippy \u2013 I must say\
  \ for as long as I can remember I have been fond of egg-based puddings.\nCleothgard\u2014\
  Some might say \u201Coverfond\u201D, ha ha ha.\nSnippy\u2014No, I don't think I\
  \ could be accused of being overfond of egg-based puddings. It is not as if I am\
  \ forever guzzling them. Perhaps once or twice a month I might treat myself to an\
  \ egg-based pudding, which seems a reasonably moderate rate to me.\nCleothgard\u2014\
  Now you are adopting a very defensive posture.\nSnippy\u2014I am not. I am merely\
  \ saying that by calling me overfond of egg-based puddings you were, let us say,\
  \ ha ha, over-egging the pudding yourself.\nThat should make clear to you the point\
  \ I was making, which\u2014to repeat\u2014is that the phrase \u201Cover-egging the\
  \ pudding\u201D will make an appearance, usually fairly early on, in any egg-based\
  \ pudding discussion. I hasten to add that the extract from the conversation between\
  \ Snippy and Cleothgard is absolutely genuine, a transcription of a tape-recorded\
  \ egg-based pudding discussion held at the edge of a field, next to a filbert-hedge,\
  \ on a somewhat damp Thursday afternoon in the latter years of the last century.\
  \ The exchange was recorded on a cassette tape and that cassette tape has been kept,\
  \ securely, in the locked drawer of a desk, the desk being in the private cabin\
  \ of a trusted sea-captain, trusted by me, at any rate. This sea-captain is captain\
  \ of a ship which has been roving the high seas almost continuously since the cassette\
  \ tape was entrusted to the captain and he locked it in the drawer of the desk in\
  \ his private cabin. Interestingly, the captain's name is Captain Pudding and his\
  \ head resembles an egg.\nIf you have been affected by this discussion of over-egging\
  \ the pudding, please call our helpline.\n[2013-10-28]"
