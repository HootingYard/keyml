text: "Whenever bumpkins gather of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane,\
  \ sooner or later their talk will turn to the Huffington Post. It is not uncommon\
  \ for the peasantry to fixate upon minutiae, of course. We think of Old Farmer Frack,\
  \ obsessed with his bellowing cows, or the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge, or any\
  \ number of pig-related outbreaks of countryside mass hysteria, often focussed upon\
  \ something as insignificant as the shape of a newborn pig's snout or trotters.\
  \ Yet the bumpkins\u2019 preoccupation with the Huffington Post was curious, for\
  \ to the untrained eye it looked like any other fencepost or stake or piece of paling.\
  \ I dare say you or I would pass by that post without giving it a glance, and the\
  \ prattle of the bumpkins of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane would\
  \ sound to us nonsensical. But rustic wisdom is hard won, and only a fool would\
  \ dismiss the bumpkins\u2019 shack chatter as drivel.\nOn a balmy evening one such\
  \ fool blundered into the shack at the end of the lane and, hearing the bumpkins\
  \ bandying the profundities of Huffington Post lore, took it for the idiocy of defectives.\
  \ With his briefcase and bowler hat it was clear the fool dwelt in a city. Clear,\
  \ too, that he could not tell the Huffington Post from any other posts and stakes\
  \ and pales thumped into the muck for fencing the fields. His manner and his smirks\
  \ were disparaging of the bumpkins, and when he left the shack and was making his\
  \ way to the railway station, they waylaid him and carried him off to the eerie\
  \ barn at Scroonhoonpooge. And as they had done with others who came to mock, they\
  \ coated him in farmyard slurry and tar and poked him with pitchforks, and when\
  \ they were done with him they buried him at midnight under the Huffington Post.\n\
