text: "A couple of nights ago I had a dream in which the protagonist was Lucas Sudja.\
  \ I had\u2014and have\u2014absolutely no idea who Mr Sudja is, or was, and so, with\
  \ my finger pressed firmly on the 21st century vacuum o\u2019 vapidity\u2014sorry,\
  \ I mean zeitgeist\u2014I took to Facecloth to find out.\n\nI was amused by those\
  \ replies where my respondents shared their own dreams, but more pertinent to this\
  \ post was Marina Organ's question whether I had Googled Lucas Sudja, and my reply.\
  \ It was only when the question was put to me that I thought about the possibility\
  \ of GoogleNod\u2014a vast archive cataloguing all that is contained, not in the\
  \ \u201Creal\u201D world, but in the world of dreams.\nThe content of GoogleNod\
  \ would of course be utterly different to the stuff we find on its parent search\
  \ engine. Utterly different, but somehow, tangentially, familiar. Lucas Sudja would\
  \ be there, along with the tribunal of Henry Cow-baiting Irish Maoists, indie band\
  \ The Fresco Runes, Dave Brock's handmade wardrobe, and a myriad of other shimmering\
  \ phantasms from the Land of Nod.\nGoogleNod would simply collect the material,\
  \ certainly make no attempt to \u201Cinterpret\u201D it. That fool's errand can\
  \ be left to the man Vladimir Nabokov called \u201Cthe Viennese quack\u201D and\
  \ his increasingly preposterous acolytes. It matters not what Lucas Sudja portends.\
  \ What matters\u2014if any of it matters at all\u2014is that he now exists, however\
  \ faint and fugitive, because I dreamed him.\n[2014-07-27]"
