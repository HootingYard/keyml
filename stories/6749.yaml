text: "Like Spandau Ballet, I bought a ticket to the world. I wish I had paid more\
  \ attention at the counter, however, because there was a misprint\u2014I hesitate\
  \ to say whether it was accidental or deliberate\u2014and what I had actually bought\
  \ was a ticket to the wold. Now, I am as much an aficionado of ranges of hills consisting\
  \ of open country overlying a base of limestone or chalk as the next man, but my\
  \ ticket did not specify which wold I could gain admittance to. I assumed it would\
  \ be a wold within the Lincolnshire Wolds or the Yorkshire Wolds or the Cotswolds,\
  \ but could narrow it down no further. I suppose I could have gone back to the kiosk\
  \ where I bought the ticket, but frankly the person behind the counter frightened\
  \ the wits out of me. Without going into details, just imagine a combination of\
  \ Rolf Harris, Douglas Bader, and Beelzebub, and you will have some idea why I hadn't\
  \ stopped shuddering for a week.\nFor it was indeed a whole week before I was able\
  \ to really put my mind to working out which wold to go to. There were so many distractions,\
  \ apart from the shuddering. I had to deal with albinos, bloating, crises (six in\
  \ number, like Nixon), Dungeness moths, embranglements, flotillas, grease, hens,\
  \ ice maidens, jigsaw puzzles, kinetic sculptures, lemonade, and monkeys, to say\
  \ nothing of the second half of the alphabet. It was a wonder to me that the issues\
  \ I had to deal with presented themselves in such an intractable order. I was impatient\
  \ for W to fall due, because I thought I would then be able to investigate the wold,\
  \ but an influx of wax put paid to that fond hope.\nEventually, having managed with\
  \ some panache to tip a zombie off the end of the pier, I took my ticket out of\
  \ my pocket and gave it a closer look. Surely there must be some indication, in\
  \ the wording, regarding the wold it was a ticket to? But no. I even put it under\
  \ a microscope, when I paid a visit to a lab, for other reasons, of which you need\
  \ not be apprised, for you know nothing of science, at least not of the science\
  \ that concerned me, which is my own special field, buster!\nAfter poring pointlessly\
  \ over gazetteers for hours upon end, it suddenly occurred to me that the wold referred\
  \ to on my ticket was not a place but a person. Could it be what I needed to pass\
  \ through the cemetery gates to visit the tomb of Terje Wold, the Norwegian politician\
  \ who died in 1972, or the grave of Herman Wold, the Swedish statistician who met\
  \ his maker twenty years later? It might even be a ticket to grant me an audience\
  \ with a living Wold, Erling Wold the American composer or, on the same continent,\
  \ the politician John S Wold, or, back in Scandinavia, among the living rather than\
  \ the dead, Susse Wold, the Danish actress?\nA trip to the United States or Norway\
  \ or Sweden or Denmark would cost rather more than going to Lincolnshire or Yorkshire\
  \ or the Cots, so I made an appointment to see my bank manager. He is almost as\
  \ frightening as the man who sold me my ticket, but in a different way, not so much\
  \ Harris and Bader and Beelzebub as Ringo Starr with indigestion and a sniper's\
  \ rifle. But needs must when the devil drives.\nSo there I was, sitting in the bank\
  \ waiting to see Mr Tugendhat, clutching my ticket to the wold in the fruitless\
  \ hope that all would become clear when, unexpectedly, all became clear. Sitting\
  \ next to me was a pale spotty teenperson to whom I suspected shampoo was a rare\
  \ and inexplicable substance. He turned to me and said:\n\u201CWow. You lucky git,\
  \ innit.\u201D\nI overlooked his ungrammatical infelicity and asked wherein lay\
  \ my good fortune.\n\u201CYou've got a ticket to the Wold,\u201D he said.\n\u201C\
  I have indeed, young whippersnapper,\u201D I replied, with the easy bonhomie I deploy\
  \ with young whippersnappers, \u201CAnd I would be luckier still if I knew which\
  \ was the wold in question.\u201D\n\u201CWell that's obvious, innit?\u201D he said,\
  \ grammatically this time, \u201CSee that little runic symbol in the corner? It's\
  \ a ticket to the Wold in Middle Earth, the area north of Rohan!\u201D\n\u201CAre\
  \ you speaking to me of Tolkien?\u201D I shrieked, almost vomiting.\n\u201CToo right,\
  \ grandad,\u201D he said.\nWithout a word, I thrust the ticket into his hand and\
  \ staggered out of the bank, disorientated and bedizened and sick. After a week\
  \ of shuddering, just when I thought things were looking up, I was cast into black\
  \ and bottomless despair. I took to my bed, and have been there ever since. As I\
  \ toss and turn and gnaw my pillow, I wonder how a tiny misprint could have turned\
  \ my simple and innocent desire to emulate Spandau Ballet into the nightmare of\
  \ traumatic Tolkieny twaddle.\n[2011-06-22]"
