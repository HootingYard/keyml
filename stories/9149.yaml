text: "A letter arrives in the post:\nDear Mr Key\nI was interested to read your comments\
  \ about The Readers\u2019 Digest, which was a formative influence when I was growing\
  \ up also. An ancient companion of my late grandmother lived with us, and was a\
  \ subscriber: she would leave copies outside her door when she'd finished with them\
  \ and we all pounced on them with glee. As well as the magazines, she received a\
  \ 78 rpm record every month from some sort of listening-club associated with the\
  \ publisher, and my brother and I were intrigued by these, as she never allowed\
  \ us to hear them (though we endured endless Caruso, Bing Crosby and The Spooncat\
  \ 5 on her wind-up gramophone). She explained that the Readers\u2019 Digest records\
  \ always got broken in the post, and we never wondered why she didn't simply cancel\
  \ the subscription.\nShe's been gone for decades; but her wind-up gramophone remained,\
  \ and when we were cleaning it up recently to send it to auction we found just one\
  \ of those white-label Readers\u2019 Digest 78s, still extant in a thin drawer in\
  \ the base of the machine. It's lo-fi stuff\u2014and pretty tame these days\u2014\
  but I've recorded the \u2018with vocal refrain\u2019 section in hopes that it will\
  \ be of interest to your readers. I used \u2018declicking\u2019 software to remove\
  \ most of the surface hiss but there's no curing the damage at the end. Doubtless\
  \ we have the Royal Mail to thank for that.\nBest wishes\n  Roland Clare\n\u266B\
