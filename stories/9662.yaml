text: "When John Foxe published Actes And Monuments, popularly known as the Book of\
  \ Martyrs, in 1563, he unaccountably neglected to mention St Spivack. This is a\
  \ great pity, as St Spivack was one of the holiest and most pious of men, whose\
  \ life we would do well to study. I have studied it in excessive detail, and as\
  \ a result I am holier and more pious than I was before, though nowhere near as\
  \ holy and pious as St Spivack himself of course. Nor have I been martyred by being\
  \ poked at with burning pincers and plunged into a barrel of boiling tar. I fervently\
  \ hope that will not be my fate, but if things turn out that way, I shall have the\
  \ example of St Spivack to cling to, and I will do my best to sing rousing hymns\
  \ in a strong, resounding falsetto, as St Spivack did, winning the grudging admiration\
  \ of his unholy and impious tormentors.\nHe was born in rustic squalor in a barn\
  \ in some sordid backwater during the Dark Ages. His parents were simple peasants.\
  \ Actually, the word \u201Csimple\u201D does not suffice. Let us rephrase that sentence.\
  \ His parents were profoundly ignorant peasants. No, that is still not enough. Again.\
  \ His parents were profoundly ignorant, staggeringly stupid peasants. I think to\
  \ drive the point home we need to have one more go. His parents were profoundly\
  \ ignorant, staggeringly stupid, breathtakingly dimwitted peasants. That will do.\
  \ They were so ignorant and stupid and dimwitted that one Dark Ages day, when he\
  \ was but a year old, they mislaid their infant in the woods, and completely forgot\
  \ about his existence. Poor little St Spivack!\nHe was raised by squirrels. Ever\
  \ after, those he met were struck, not just by his holiness and his piety, but by\
  \ a certain squirrely something in his demeanour. He had an extremely high metabolic\
  \ rate and ate a lot of nuts.\nAt the age of ten, he was discovered in the woods\
  \ by a sycamore-climbing monk from the nearby monastery of St Dippy's. This monk\
  \ took the holy and pious child with him, and at the monastery he astounded the\
  \ abbot by reciting from memory the entire book of Ecclesiastes, first in the original\
  \ Hebrew, then in Greek, then in Latin, then in the language of squirrels. He took\
  \ holy orders on his eleventh birthday.\nWhen he was twelve St Spivack left the\
  \ monastery and set off on a pilgrimage. Wherever he stopped, he preached, and his\
  \ sermons converted many an ignorant and stupid and dimwitted peasant to the faith.\
  \ Most of his sermons consisted of glosses on passages from Ecclesiastes, though\
  \ on occasion he would describe visions.\nIt was in the village of Vig, hard by\
  \ the banks of the Vug, that St Spivack was describing a vision one day when he\
  \ was arrested by the henchmen of a baron. This baron was an unholy and impious\
  \ wretch, and he tossed St Spivack into an oubliette in his castle. There were many\
  \ ants and beetles in the dungeon, and St Spivack befriended them. He passed the\
  \ horrible days and weeks by making little sets of rosary beads for the ants and\
  \ beetles from grains of unspeakable matter found upon the oubliette floor.\nOn\
  \ Easter Sunday one year in the Dark Ages, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St\
  \ Spivack in the gloom of the oubliette. She handed him a pair of spectral gleaming\
  \ holy tweezers with which he was able to effect his escape. It was at this time\
  \ that light began to pour out from St Spivack. This was the light that blinded\
  \ the evil baron and his henchmen as they tried to recapture their holy and pious\
  \ prisoner.\nSt Spivack continued on his pilgrimage through the benighted lands\
  \ of the Dark Ages. In his train there followed squirrels and ants and beetles.\
  \ One day he performed the miracle that guaranteed his sainthood, though in all\
  \ honesty it should never have been in doubt. (It is said that when the Congregation\
  \ for the Causes of Saints met to decide on his canonisation, the priest taking\
  \ the part of the Devil's Advocate, to argue against, suffered an attack of the\
  \ withers just as he was about to speak. This was rightly taken as another sign\
  \ of St Spivack's saintliness.) The miracle took place in the village of Vug, hard\
  \ by the banks of the Vig. St Spivack produced out of thin air a bouquet of lupins\
  \ and rhododendrons, and by waving it in significant passing movements over a crone,\
  \ cured the crone of a foul and sickening malady, a debilitating palsy or ague to\
  \ which Dark Ages crones were forever falling prey.\nOn St Bibblybibdib's Day one\
  \ year, later in the Dark Ages, St Spivack arrived in Pointy Town at the end of\
  \ his pilgrimage. He was enthroned as bishop in the pointiest church in Pointy Town.\
  \ He continued to pour forth an unearthly blinding light. Squirrels and ants and\
  \ beetles had the run of the episcopal palace, pointier than the pointiest church\
  \ in Pointy Town. St Spivack by now could recite from memory several other books\
  \ of the Bible, in several languages, and often did so in everyday conversation.\
  \ A Dark Ages scribe copied down many of his after-dinner monologues to create what\
  \ we now know as the Codex of St Spivack.\nOne year in the Dark Ages, on St Dippy's\
  \ Day, into Pointy Town came galloping the blind baron and his blind henchmen, astride\
  \ their seeing horses. They laid siege to the bishop's palace and slaughtered all\
  \ the squirrels and ants and beetles and they dragged St Spivack from his dinner\
  \ table, where he was eating nuts. Then they had at him with burning pincers and\
  \ they plunged him into a barrel of boiling tar. St Spivack sang rousing hymns in\
  \ a strong, resounding falsetto, and then he died. The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared\
  \ and carried him up to heaven.\nHis tarry bones were buried in a tar pit, which\
  \ is today the site of the Blister Lane Bypass.\nThat is the life of the holy and\
  \ pious martyr St Spivack.\n[2012-07-16]"
