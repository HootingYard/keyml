text: "On 28 December 1973, I attended my first gig. I had been taken to concerts\
  \ before, notably (and inexplicably) by my father to the Albert Hall to see the\
  \ absurd gravel-throated troubadour Rod McKuen, but this winter's night was my first\
  \ outing, unaccompanied by an adult, to the world of rock. My friend Paul Pearce\
  \ and I took the Central Line into London from our homes in the blighted wastelands\
  \ of suburban Essex, and fetched up at the Lyceum, just off the Strand. We had come\
  \ to see \u2026 Gong (or The Gong, as Bernard Levin would have it).\n\nNow, bear\
  \ in mind that I was a wet-behind-the-ears young teenperson. Molesworth would have\
  \ called me uterly wet and a weed, and he would have been right. Somehow, in the\
  \ preceding months, I had managed to convince myself that a bunch of drug-addled\
  \ hippies caterwauling about gnomes and flying teapots represented a world I was\
  \ avid to be part of.\nMany of my schoolfriends were in thrall to glam rock, but\
  \ I pooh-poohed Marc Bolan and David Bowie and their ilk as hideously commercial.\
  \ I veered towards what I thought of as the progressive and the underground, and\
  \ Gong fitted the bill. So there were Paul Pearce and I, wide-eyed and innocent,\
  \ surrounded by long hair and beards and kaftans and foul-smelling Afghan coats,\
  \ while on stage Daevid Allen and his chums caterwauled and parped and made the\
  \ kind of din I told myself I adored.\nBeing wet and weedy, Paul and I of course\
  \ had to ensure we did not miss the last tube train home, so we left the gig early.\
  \ My memory is dim, but I suspect I was elated. I had seen my future, or so I thought.\
  \ I would live in a filthy commune and take lots of drugs and reject straight society\
  \ and possibly even strum a guitar.\nIt did not quite work out like that, though\
  \ the dream lingered for a couple more years. I went to lots more gigs, and saw\
  \ Soft Machine and Stackridge and Henry Cow and Wally and Kevin Coyne and Jethro\
  \ Tull and Hatfield & The North and many others. But I never saw Gong again.\n[2017-11-26]"
