  Critically important advice, in my cupboard at The Dabbler, on correct apprehension
  of the dimensions of sea beasties. I claim no credit, as the piece is basically
  a paraphrase of Pebblehead, from one of his innumerable bestselling paperbacks.

  Over the years, many readers have written to ask if there is any truth in the rumour
  that, long before Frost/Nixon, there was a project entitled Frost/Pebblehead, or
  even Pebblehead/Nixon, which had to be abandoned due to pelf and priggishness and
  panic and other things beginning with P. Many readers have asked, and none has been
  answered, for I chuck all such enquiries into a waste chute, down which they fall,
  rolling and tumbling, until they reach the fires of hell, where they burn to a crisp.
  Some things are better left uninvestigated, unresearched, unsaid.
