text: "Let us consider the Man at C&A, where C and A are points on a plane equidistant\
  \ from central point B. We might ask, reasonably, why C precedes A in this hypothetical\
  \ space, when it is more usual, much more usual, for A to precede C, but quite frankly\
  \ this is the least of our worries. Far more problematic is the idea that the Man\
  \ is at C and A simultaneously. Greater minds than mine have, over the centuries,\
  \ devised the natural laws by which everything in the known universe is bound, and\
  \ I would not be exaggerating if I said that these laws simply will not tolerate\
  \ a man being in two places at once.\nWe can immediately dispose of the somewhat\
  \ desperate solution that the Man at point A is a doppelg\xE4nger, one who appears\
  \ identical in every respect to the \u201Coriginal\u201D man at point C, but is\
  \ not him. To show how facetious this idea is, we need only remark that we are dealing\
  \ with the Man at C&A, not the Men, and it is the plural Men we would be speaking\
  \ of if we had the Man at C and another Man at A, no matter how uncannily the latter\
  \ resembled the former, even down to the precise number of hairs on the head or\
  \ the disposition of pockmarks on the grisly countenance.\nSo we must be clear that\
  \ when we speak of the Man at C&A, we speak of the same Man, absolutely identical\
  \ in all particulars, at both point C and point A which, if you are paying attention,\
  \ you will remember are equidistant from point B. Point B, by the way. is unoccupied,\
  \ by either Man or Woman or Beast of the Field. We posit its existence the better\
  \ to comprehend the space between C and A, and also because, in its absence, there\
  \ would be no reason I can think of why we should not call point C point B. But\
  \ as I say, there are greater minds than mine, and perhaps one of them could devise\
  \ a compelling reason why B should be ejected from the hypothesis entirely. Until\
  \ such reasoning is applied, however, we will continue to insert an unoccupied point\
  \ B between, and equidistant from, the two points at C and A which, as we have seen,\
  \ are occupied by the Man.\nGosh, this is fun.\nWe might stumble towards a comprehensive\
  \ explanation of the Man being at C and A if we introduce the element of Time. Let\
  \ us imagine we are wearing a cheap wristwatch, and keeping one eye upon it as we\
  \ consider the Man at C&A. The whole damn thing makes sense if we are able to say\
  \ that the Man is at C at, say, 10.30 AM, and at A at 2.30 PM. We might want to\
  \ ask how on earth it takes him four hours to make the simple journey from C to\
  \ A, passing through B to pick up a sausage roll for sustenance, but we can perhaps\
  \ account for that by giving him a pair of crutches upon which he must lug himself\
  \ along, his legs being withered. Such infirmity would fit neatly with the grisly\
  \ countenance above noted.\nThe obvious objection to this ostensibly happy solution\
  \ is that we are thus dealing not with the Man at C&A but with the Man at C then\
  \ A. We must, then, regrettably, remove the cheap wristwatch and chuck it into a\
  \ ditch and scratch our head in bewilderment. Think! Think! Aha! A faint glimmer\
  \ slowly resolves itself into the near certainty a solution can be found if we imagine\
  \ point C and point A as so close together, almost abutting one another, with only\
  \ tiny little point B between them, that the Man is straddling them, one foot planted\
  \ firmly at C and the other at A. He is indubitably the Man at C&A!\nBut on second\
  \ thoughts we must knock this proposition down, violently. It has already been shown\
  \ that the man's legs are withered and he must rely upon crutches. It is beyond\
  \ the bounds of sense that such a cripple could stand, steady and upright and resolute,\
  \ with either foot planted firmly anywhere at all. The best he could do would be\
  \ to lock the base of one crutch in position at point C and the other at point A,\
  \ and balance himself, swinging between them. But it can be proved, using geometry\
  \ or one of the allied disciplines devised by better minds than my own, that he\
  \ would of necessity be swinging in the air just above point B, the tiny point,\
  \ you recall, we have jammed between point C and point A for cogent reasons not\
  \ to be gainsaid. He is therefore the Man at B, or, at best, the Man at B whose\
  \ crutches are planted at C&A. Even a halfwit, I think, would have to concede that\
  \ such a fellow is a very different beast to a bona fide Man at C&A.\nIncreasingly\
  \ befuddled, we may have to return, reluctantly, to the less than satisfactory doppelg\xE4\
  nger theory or, even more reluctantly, suspend the laws of physics. But wait! Could\
  \ it be that the answer is staring us in the face, or rather glancing at us slantwise,\
  \ at an unexpected angle? Could it all be a bit of stage trickery mustered up by\
  \ a conjurer, employing a mirror, perhaps, placed at point B? If we could identify\
  \ an encrutched variety theatre magician of grisly countenance, we would surely\
  \ be home and dry. And immediately one springs to mind. Who will ever forget the\
  \ crippled crutch-bound maestro The Amazing Blinko And His Lovely Assistant Janet?\
  \ Surely it is The Amazing Blinko who, with the aid of a mirror, or more likely\
  \ mirrors plural, is the Man who appears to be at both C and A at one and the same\
  \ time!\nWe can now go and take a nap, having solved the conundrum. Alas, our nap\
  \ is troubled by uneasy dreams, and we wake in a cold sweat, an unanswerable question\
  \ clanging in our head\u2014by what feat of legerdemain did The Amazing Blinko make\
  \ His Lovely Assistant Janet softly and suddenly vanish away from C&A?\n[2015-04-27]"
