text: "Many moons ago, when the Hooting Yard website was but young\u2014on the ninth\
  \ of March 2004, to be precise\u2014I noted the fact I had learned that Ambrose\
  \ Bierce had twelve siblings, all of whose given names began, like his, with the\
  \ letter A. In the brief postage where I mentioned this, I included a request for\
  \ a knowledgeable reader to let me know what all those names were. Six and a half\
  \ years have passed, and do you know, not a single one of you has bothered to respond.\
  \ This is simply not good enough. I do not think it is too much to expect that my\
  \ loyal and devoted readers should register such a request and beaver away, burning\
  \ the candle at both ends, putting their own lives on hold if necessary, until they\
  \ have discovered the information I am seeking.\nWait a moment while I emit a sigh,\
  \ an expressive sigh which somehow commingles saintly patience and inordinate mental\
  \ suffering and fathomless disappointment.\nThere. Now, because of the distinct\
  \ want of diligent research on your part, I have had to find out the names of Ambrose\
  \ Bierce's siblings all by myself. You see what trouble you have caused me? Anyway,\
  \ let bygones be bygones. Let us move forward in a spirit of happy comity, striding\
  \ purposefully towards the slightly overcast uplands, me a preening magnifico and\
  \ you lot stricken by unassuageable pangs of guilt.\nOh, and before I forget, here\
  \ are those names, of the thirteen children of Marcus Aurelius Bierce and his wife\
  \ Laura Sherwood Bierce, of Horse Cave Creek, Meigs County, Ohio. From the oldest\
  \ to the youngest, they were: Abigail, Amelia, Ann Maria, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus,\
  \ Almeda, Andrew, Albert, Ambrose, Arthur, and the twins Adelia and Aurelia. Unusually\
  \ for those days, all but the youngest three survived to adulthood (which also begins\
  \ with A).\n[2010-09-17]"
