text: "Today is the feast day of St Mungo, so let us unearth one of his diary entries,\
  \ for this day in 573, precisely one thousand five hundred and forty years ago.\n\
  \nWoke up in the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Sausages for breakfast. Thought about building\
  \ another cathedral but quite honestly did not feel up to it. While I knelt in the\
  \ muck praying, a messenger person came hurrying along and told me that a mad prophet\
  \ by the name of Lailoken was rampaging about the place. He is apparently one of\
  \ those wild men of the woods, the only difference being that he spouts prognostications\
  \ which have the effect of turning the heads of the peasantry away from the glory\
  \ of Christ Jesus.\n\u201CCan you do something holy to bring an end to his mischief?\u201D\
  \ said the messenger person.\n\u201CI shall see what I can do,\u201D I said, wearily,\
  \ for forsooth I was weary and footsore and had many another malady as tend to afflict\
  \ those of us living in such barbaric times.\nI struggled up from my knees and tottered\
  \ off towards that part of the blasted and inhospitable countryside where this mad\
  \ fellow was reportedly to be found. On my way I saw a bird that never flew and\
  \ a tree that never grew and a bell that never rang and a fish that never swam.\
  \ It is not often you see a bird and a tree and a bell and a fish all together in\
  \ close proximity. A bird and a tree together, yes, and conceivably a bird and a\
  \ tree and a bell, but the fish as well, that seemed anomalous. I wondered if it\
  \ might be a miracle sent by the Lord. If so, what did it portend? These are weighty\
  \ matters of great spiritual significance.\nSomething that is most definitely not\
  \ of great spiritual significance is the raving of this wild man Lailoken, who I\
  \ found cutting capers at the edge of the forest. He was engarbed in animal pelts\
  \ and exceedingly wild and hairy. I brandished a jewel-encrusted crucifix from the\
  \ cathedral at him and bid him desist on pain of hellfire. It started to rain and\
  \ he retreated into the woods. I blessed a few Strathclyde peasants who were loitering\
  \ thereabouts and was pleased to hear them begin wailing and keening my name over\
  \ and over again\u2014\u201CMungo! Mungo! Mungo!\u201D, they wailed and keened.\
  \ It was music to my ears.\nIn the evening I had a bath and an eerie premonition\
  \ of death in a bath at some point early in the next century. Oo-er, missus!\n[2013-01-14]"
