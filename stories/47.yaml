text: "It is with some trepidation that I announce an imminent court case. For a long\
  \ time I turned a blind eye to the continued boasts of the L'Oreal company that\
  \ some of their shiny hair products are enhanced by Light Reflecting Booster Technology.\
  \ I am appalled that they continue to make this claim in their television adverts\
  \ despite numerous letters urging them to desist. Well, I have been provoked far\
  \ enough. Here at Hooting Yard we will be suing L'Oreal for infringement of intellectual\
  \ property rights. Regular readers will be aware that every single word that appears\
  \ on this website, and every word broadcast in the associated podcasts, could not\
  \ have been wrenched from the innermost depths of Mr Key's soul without Hooting\
  \ Yard's very own Light Reflecting Booster Technology. We got there first, L'Oreal!\n\
  P.S.\_: If anyone can recommend a suitably shabby and cheap solicitor, please get\
  \ in touch. Because I'm worth it.\n[2007-02-13]"
