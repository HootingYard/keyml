text: "Moderniser is favourite to lead Russian church, says the headline in today's\
  \ Guardian. The online edition sadly does not include the photograph of dynamic\
  \ thrusting modernist Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk which appeared in the paper.\
  \ But do not fret. I have found one, so readers\u2019 jaws can drop at the breathtaking\
  \ modernity of the man they call \u201CMetropolitan Kirill of Smolensk\u201D. That's\
  \ him on the right, in the oh so modern colourful robes, unlike the hopelessly pass\xE9\
  \ figures next to him, who look positively mediaeval in their black garb. On the\
  \ other hand, they might be beatniks, and it's Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk who's\
  \ behind the times, daddy-o.\n\n[2009-01-28]"
