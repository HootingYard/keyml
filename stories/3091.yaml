  \ out of dough and string and wax and coathangers and processed cheese triangles\

  Dear Ubermungo\u2122. I am a flapper. When I flap with too great enthusiasm, my\
  \ cloche hat becomes dislodged. What advice would you give?\u2014Poopy Clingclang\n\
  Well, Poopy, if you glue your hat to your head with a proprietary hat-head adhesive,\
  \ future dislodgements will be rarer than albino Stalinists, and you can flap the\
  \ night away to your heart's content.\nDear Ubermungo\u2122. What in the name of\
  \ god is a nudibranch?\u2014P V Bib\nWait while my innards process the question,\
  \ P V.\nDear Ubermungo\u2122. Yesterday I tied a yellow ribbon round an old oak\
  \ tree. Today I am searching for the hero inside myself. Tomorrow I am thinking\
  \ it might be a good idea to find out if my friends are electric. Are any of these\
  \ activities valid?\u2014S Fry\nStephen\u2014No, they are not. Go and boil your\
  \ head.\nDear Ubermungo\u2122. Who won the FA Cup Final in 1968?\u2014Bathsheba\
  \ Gubbins (Mrs)\nMy innards are still whirring and buzzing away at P V Bib's question,\
  \ Mrs Gubbins, but the answer is something like West Bromwich Noblia. You may wish\
  \ to check that.\nDear Ubermungo\u2122. Shortly after taking part in the Tet Offensive,\
  \ I was sitting on a balcony in a foreign capital city when my attention was drawn\
  \ ineluctably to a toad sitting on a neighbouring balcony. Like many toads, it had\
  \ a jewel embedded in its head, a jewel that glittered so brightly it was visible\
  \ through the toad's translucent green skin. My balcony was covered with an awning,\
  \ so when a violent rainstorm began, I was untroubled. But the toad's balcony had\
  \ no awning, and despite its amphibious nature the toad appeared disconcerted by\
  \ the rain, and it hopped away, out of my sight. The thing is, in the years that\
  \ followed, I have been haunted by that brief vision, and more particularly, unmoored\
  \ from peace and reason by my ignorance of precisely what sort of precious stone\
  \ was lodged in the head of the toad. If I were to draw, with a pencil, from memory,\
  \ a sketch showing the way the soon-to-be expunged sunlight glistened, through the\
  \ skin, upon the jewel, the angles it cast, the tints and textures of the light,\
  \ do you think you might be able to ascertain whether it was, say, a ruby or an\
  \ emerald or an amethyst?\u2014\u201CPhnom Penh Vet\u201D\nDear Tet Vet, All would\
  \ depend on the skill with which you wield a pencil. You should also bear in mind\
  \ that I am a mere artificial brain, and have no eyes, and thus cannot see. What\
  \ I can do, at last, is tell P V Bib that a nudibranch is a sea slug.\nDear Ubermungo\u2122\
  . What is life but a vale of affliction?\u2014Old Halob\nLife can also be an opportunity\
  \ to stand at the side of a running track, coughing up catarrh and keeping a beady\
  \ eye on a stopwatch, dressed in a sordid raincoat and a Homburg hat. You should\
  \ know that better than anybody, Old Halob!\n[2009-09-13]"
