text: "\u201CI think,\u201D said Dobson, at breakfast one foul and rain-sodden Tuesday\
  \ morning, \u201CIt is time we had our own mosh pit.\u201D\nMarigold Chew raised\
  \ an eyebrow.\n\u201CDo you actually know what a mosh pit is?\u201D she asked.\n\
  \u201CNot exactly,\u201D replied the twentieth century's greatest out of print pamphleteer,\
  \ \u201CBut I suspect it would be a good use of that part of the garden overhung\
  \ by laburnum and sycamore and larch. You know that patch o'er which hangs leafage\
  \ so dense that it is forever in shadow, and is home to brambles and nettles and\
  \ dockweed. I cannot even remember the last time I sat or stood in it nor even walked\
  \ though it, nor can I recall ever seeing you doing so, O cherished one. It is unused\
  \ ground, and no ground ought to be unused on this earth, according to some authorities.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhich authorities might they be, Dobson?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\u201C\
  I think there is a maxim to that effect in the Maxims of Bombastus Dogend, or I\
  \ could be thinking of Listerine Optrex, also a great one for maxims. I can check\
  \ later.\u201D\n\u201CSo let me get this straight,\u201D said Marigold Chew, marshalling\
  \ with her fork the last few caraway seeds on her breakfast plate, \u201CYou intend\
  \ to dig a pit in a shady arbour in the garden, and dub it a mosh pit, without any\
  \ clear understanding\u2014without any understanding at all\u2014of what a mosh\
  \ pit is?\u201D\n\u201CI shall look it up in a thick and exhaustive reference book,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson, mad with cornflakes.\n\u201CSo you will be going to the mobile library?\u201D\
  \ said Marigold Chew.\n\u201CThat is my plan,\u201D said the pamphleteer, and he\
  \ got up from the table and proceeded to don his Andalusian Sewage Inspector's boots.\n\
  \u201CToday is Tuesday,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CSo the mobile library is\
  \ in quite a different, and distant, bailiwick.\u201D\n\u201CAnd you think I am\
  \ going to let that stop me?\u201D shouted Dobson melodramatically as he crashed\
  \ out of the door into the downpour.\nUntold hours later, Dobson came crashing back\
  \ through the door, sopping wet, with a gleam in his eye and a thin, pained smile\
  \ playing about his lips, as if he were Ronald Colman shooting a scene for Random\
  \ Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942).\n\u201CWell, Dobson, what news?\u201D asked Marigold\
  \ Chew.\nDobson took his pipe from his pocket, crammed into it a thub of Rotting\
  \ Orchard Fruit \u2018n\u2019 Conkers Pipe Tobacco from his other pocket, lit up\
  \ and puffed, and said:\n\u201CI had a deal of difficulty finding the thick and\
  \ exhaustive reference book I sought. Actually, before that I had a deal of difficulty\
  \ finding the mobile library itself. There is a new mobile librarian, of wild and\
  \ untrammelled mien, with an unruly beard, whose grasp of the schedule is weak.\
  \ He had driven the pantechnicon to quite an unsuitable bailiwick, near cliffs,\
  \ where the native peasants, having never seen the mobile library before, stood\
  \ in a ring around it, holding aloft their pitchforks and sticks tipped with tarry\
  \ burning rags, gawping. I think they may have had it in mind to sacrifice the mobile\
  \ librarian on a pyre.\u201D\n\u201CGosh!\u201D said Marigold Chew.\n\u201CBe that\
  \ as it may,\u201D continued Dobson, \u201CI barged my way through the seething\
  \ peasant throng and climbed into the pantechnicon. The wild beardy person was engaged\
  \ in some sort of haphazard reshelving exercise, oblivious of the peasants outside.\
  \ The mobile library holdings, including several thick and exhaustive reference\
  \ books, one of which was critical to my research, lay scattered about higgledy-piggledy.\
  \ Oh! I was sorely vexed. But I found what I wanted eventually, under a pile of\
  \ paperback potboilers by Pebblehead. And\u2014\u201C\n\u201CYou have created a\
  \ puddle on the floor, Dobson,\u201D interrupted Marigold Chew, \u201CSo soaked\
  \ you are from rainfall. Finish your pipe and mop up the puddle and then you can\
  \ continue your tale over a nice piping hot cup of ersatz cocoa substitute.\u201D\
  \nAnd it was during the subsequent conversation that the out of print pamphleteer\
  \ revealed to his poppet that he had indeed discovered the nature of a mosh pit.\n\
  \u201CApparently,\u201D he said, \u201CA mosh pit is an area where gaggles of frenzied\
  \ teenpersons hurl themselves about in an uncoordinated and rambunctious manner\
  \ to a soundtrack of improbably loud and thumping and often discordant electrified\
  \ racket played from an adjacent stage or platform by persons not dissimilar to\
  \ the denizens of the mosh pit.\u201D\n\u201CYes, I know,\u201D said Marigold Chew,\
  \ \u201CI could have told you that this morning over breakfast. I assume that now\
  \ you know what a mosh pit is you no longer want one in your own back garden.\u201D\
  \n\u201CQuite the contrary, my sweet!\u201D shouted Dobson with unnerving zest,\
  \ \u201CI am all the more determined to dig one! Hand me that spade!\u201D\nAnd\
  \ though it was now dark, and the rain was pouring down more heavily than ever,\
  \ Dobson was soon enough out in the garden, under the dripping leafage of laburnum\
  \ and sycamore and larch, digging a pit. Positing that he had taken leave of his\
  \ senses, Marigold Chew retired to her boudoir to listen to Xavier Cugat And His\
  \ Orchestra on the wireless.\nAt some point in the small hours of the morning, Dobson\
  \ came back indoors. He was covered in mud, as if he had been toiling in the trenches\
  \ of Flanders fields during the Great War, the cause of the shellshock suffered\
  \ by Smithy, alias Charles Rainier, the character played by Ronald Colman in Random\
  \ Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942). Marigold Chew was fast asleep, but she was woken\
  \ by a repetitive dull thumping noise, as of bone cushioned by flesh bashing against\
  \ wood, over and over again. She went downstairs to find Dobson slumped at the kitchenette\
  \ table, repeatedly thumping his forehead against its polished wooden surface.\n\
  \u201CWhatever is the matter, Dobson?\u201D she asked.\nDobson looked up.\n\u201C\
  The mosh pit is dug, my dear! It needs but a complement of frenzied teenpersons\
  \ to be deposited within it. That is my quandary, that the reason for my despair.\u201D\
  \n\u201CPlease explain Dobson, you have me utterly befuddled. Though it be the middle\
  \ of the night I am going to put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of powdered\
  \ milk slops enriched with filbert nut flavouring. Pray continue.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Well,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CIt was only when I had finished digging the mosh\
  \ pit, and clambered out of it, and stood back to admire my work in the brilliant\
  \ illumination of Kleig lights, that I realised the fatal flaw at the heart of my\
  \ design.\u201D\n\u201CWhich is?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\u201CWe have not space\
  \ in the garden sufficient to erect a stage or platform next to the mosh pit,\u201D\
  \ moaned Dobson, \u201CThus nowhere to assemble a grouplet of persons to provide\
  \ the necessary soundtrack of improbably loud and thumping and often discordant\
  \ electrified racket to which frenzied teenpersons so minded will mosh.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Look on the bright side,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CWe may not have our own\
  \ mosh pit, but now we have an all-purpose pit. There is a myriad of usages to which\
  \ it could be put. I can think of several immediately, but I will refrain from telling\
  \ you right away. I think you need a disinfectant bath and a good night's sleep.\u201D\
  \n\u201CPerhaps you are right, buttercup,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CAnd in any case\
  \ there may be such an activity as moshing for the deaf, or moshing to the sound\
  \ of a lone piccolo, or other types of moshing yet unimagined by frenzied teenpersons,\
  \ and by unfrenzied teenpersons too. Tomorrow I shall go the mobile library again,\
  \ assuming it has not been shoved over the cliffs by the baffled and menacing peasants,\
  \ and I shall undertake further and more rigorous research..\u201D\n\u201CThat is\
  \ an excellent idea, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CBut before plunging\
  \ into your disinfectant bath, just tell me one thing. Why on earth did you want\
  \ to have frenzied teenpersons hurling themselves about in an uncoordinated and\
  \ rambunctious manner to a soundtrack of improbably loud and thumping and often\
  \ discordant electrified racket in your own back garden in the first place?\u201D\
  \nAlas, whatever Dobson said in reply was drowned out by the piercing shriek of\
  \ the now boiling kettle.\nSome days later, Marigold Chew hoicked the spade and\
  \ filled in the pit under the leafage, still dripping with rain, of laburnum and\
  \ sycamore and larch, and strewed over it brambles and nettles and dockweed. Never\
  \ again did the word \u201Cmosh\u201D ever pass Dobson's lips. Other matters had\
  \ attracted his attention, as related in his pamphlet How I Witnessed The Sight\
  \ Of A Wild And Bearded Mobile Librarian In Hand To Hand Combat With A Snarling\
  \ Gaggle Of Brain-Bejangled Peasants (out of print).\n[2011-07-25]"
