text: "Today I would like to tell you about cisterns. Specifically, I would like to\
  \ talk about my brother's cistern and my sister's cistern. They are two very different\
  \ cisterns. My brother's cistern was manufactured by Pastewick & Co, an old family-run\
  \ firm, whereas my sister built her own.\nPastewick cisterns are admired for the\
  \ simple elegance of their design, which still relies on a chain rather than a lever\
  \ or push button. The founder of the firm, Alonzo Pastewick, who cut a sort of Scaramouche\
  \ figure, was what is known as a \u201Cchain cistern man\u201D in the trade. In\
  \ contrast to the simplicity of the cistern itself, Pastewick chains tend to be\
  \ rococo. My brother's cistern's chain, for example, is a wonder of metalwork, knotty\
  \ and swirling and embedded with floral motifs, at the end of which is a wooden\
  \ handle carved in the form of a Naiad, the Greek fresh water nymph. Neither chain\
  \ nor handle is a Pastewick original, for these\u2014made before 1911\u2014are now\
  \ much-prized and highly expensive. What my brother has is a modern reproduction,\
  \ made by Pastewick & Co themselves, and still fairly pricey. When he bought the\
  \ house in which the cistern lurked, like a porcelain treasure, it had one of the\
  \ postwar \u2018Suspension Bridge\u2019 chains the company favoured at the time.\
  \ It had been ill-treated by the previous occupants\u2014God knows how!\u2014and\
  \ was buckled and rusting. My brother devised a foolish tale about the chain having\
  \ been used to weigh down a corpse thrown into a lake, then subsequently recovered,\
  \ and even tried to sell a short story based upon his idea to Madcap Potboilers!\
  \ magazine. The editor sensibly refused it and the manuscript ended up as fuel for\
  \ a bonfire.\nI have never been entirely clear how my brother raised the money to\
  \ buy the Naiad reproduction. Arrested an extraordinary four times in connection\
  \ with the Sausage Factory Affair, no charges were ever levelled against him and\
  \ so I suppose he must be innocent. He was also able to prove that the snapshots\
  \ of him in a conspiratorial huddle with Soapy Binglegloom were faked, which presumably\
  \ means he had nothing to do with the Pointy Town Killings. Anyway, however he raised\
  \ the cash, my brother was able to replace his chain and handle within two years\
  \ of moving in. He even threw a party to celebrate the occasion, which as far as\
  \ I know is the only time he has ever hosted a party. Certainly it's the only one\
  \ I have ever been invited to. I was astonished at all the celebrities who were\
  \ there. I had no idea my brother had even heard of DeForest Kelley, Nikolaus Pevsner,\
  \ or Olivia De Havilland, let alone that he was on back-slapping terms with them.\
  \ Of course we all had to troop into the bathroom at one point to admire the Pastewick\
  \ reproduction, while my brother brayed. That was the night of the Squirrel Sanctuary\
  \ Horror, so he had a perfect alibi.\nMy sister wasn't at the party, though she\
  \ had been invited. She had a good excuse, having slipped a disc while doing the\
  \ final digging for her home-made cistern. Hers is a huge tank with a cement floor\
  \ and dirt walls coated in plaster. There is a lid, of course, to prevent mud, creepy\
  \ crawlies, small creatures such as otters or weasels, or her seven children from\
  \ getting into the water. She pooh-poohs Pastewick and all his works. \u201CThe\
  \ man was but a Scaramouche chain cistern man,\u201D she wrote in her latest letter\
  \ to me, from her cell in the Big Grim Prison at Vug-On-The-Ack, where she is on\
  \ remand as the chief suspect in the Choctaw Guide Dog Scandal. I have no idea whether\
  \ she is innocent or guilty, but I promised her I would keep an eye on her cistern,\
  \ and that I shall.\n[2007-03-12]"
