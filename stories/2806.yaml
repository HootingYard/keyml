text: "\u201CI never think or speak of the \u2018New England Primer\u2019 that I do\
  \ not recall Captivity Waite, for it was Captivity who introduced me to the Primer\
  \ that day in the springtime of sixty-three years ago. She was of my age, a bright,\
  \ pretty girl\u2014a very pretty, an exceptionally pretty girl, as girls go. We\
  \ belonged to the same Sunday-school class. I remember that upon this particular\
  \ day she brought me a russet apple. It was she who discovered the Primer in the\
  \ mahogany case, and what was not our joy as we turned over the tiny pages together\
  \ and feasted our eyes upon the vivid pictures and perused the absorbingly interesting\
  \ text! What wonder that together we wept tears of sympathy at the harrowing recital\
  \ of the fate of John Rogers!\n\u201CEven at this remote date I cannot recall that\
  \ experience with Captivity, involving as it did the wood-cut representing the unfortunate\
  \ Rogers standing in an impossible bonfire and being consumed thereby in the presence\
  \ of his wife and their numerous progeny, strung along in a pitiful line across\
  \ the picture for artistic effect\u2014even now, I say, I cannot contemplate that\
  \ experience and that wood-cut without feeling lumpy in my throat and moist about\
  \ my eyes.\n\u201CHow lasting are the impressions made upon the youthful mind!\u2026\
  \ still with many a sympathetic shudder and tingle do I recall Captivity's overpowering\
  \ sense of horror, and mine, as we lingered long over the portraitures of Timothy\
  \ flying from Sin\u2026\n\u201CCaptivity Waite never approved of my fondness for\
  \ fairy literature\u2026 When it came to fiction involving witches, ogres, and flubdubs,\
  \ that was too much for Captivity, and the spirit of the little Puritan revolted.\n\
  \u201CCaptivity's ancestors (both paternal and maternal) were, in the palmy colonial\
  \ times, as abject slaves to superstition as could well be imagined. The Waites\
  \ of Salem were famous persecutors of witches, and Sinai Higginbotham (Captivity's\
  \ great-great- grandfather on her mother's side of the family) was Cotton Mather's\
  \ boon companion, and rode around the gallows with that zealous theologian on that\
  \ memorable occasion when five young women were hanged at Danvers upon the charge\
  \ of having tormented little children with their damnable arts of witchcraft\u2026\
  \n\u201CI have thought of Captivity Waite a great many times, and I have not unfrequently\
  \ wondered what might have been but for that book of fairy tales which my Uncle\
  \ Cephas sent me.\u201D\nEugene Field, The Love Affairs Of A Bibliomaniac (1896)\n\
