  Another day I was looking for somewhere to live and went in a north-westerly direction.\
  \ From some dingy agent in the vicinity I got the key of a house to let. Wandering\
  \ along the streets I came to a row of peeling stucco houses with cat-walks in front,\
  \ and mouldering urns, which could hold nothing, surmounting their plastered gate-posts.\n\
  \u201CMy key fitted the front door of one of these houses; I went in and up the\
  \ stairs to the first floor. I entered a large room with three windows looking out\
  \ upon the road; folding doors connected it with the room behind. These I pushed\
  \ open and found myself in another room exactly like the first; I went over to the\
  \ central one of its three windows and looked out. Instead of the characterless\
  \ gardens and hinder facade of a parallel block, I saw a sloping strip of ground\
  \ overgrown with brambles, then a pebbly shore, and beyond, the crash and smother\
  \ of Atlantic waves, breaking ceaselessly and without tide. This ocean stretched\
  \ away to the horizon where it met a misty sky, but did not merge with it\u2014\
  the heaving water set up a melancholy distinction out there; and here within, a\
  \ briney exultant smell penetrated the panes, cutting through the mustiness of a\
  \ house long closed.\n\u201CWhat extraordinary growths, I wondered, flowered in\
  \ those wasteful depths? There must be a submerged garden whose silken green held\
  \ curiosities far surpassing those I had come upon before. Idiots often describe\
  \ such places and describe what they see; making idiots is one of the sea's favourite\
  \ games. But when it tires from this from time to time, it casts up instead a supernatural\
  \ being on an unwelcoming strand, who ever afterwards, spends his nights asleep\
  \ at the bottom of some vast watery gulf.\u201D\nIthell Colquhoun, Goose Of Hermogenes\
