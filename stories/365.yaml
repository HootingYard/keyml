text: "Committed Dobsonists often turn their minds to the perplexing question of how\
  \ the out of print pamphleteer would have coped with the 21st century. It is difficult\
  \ to imagine him in our world o\u2019 bleeping digital flummery \u2018n\u2019 pap,\
  \ is it not? But now I think I have stumbled upon something which clearly calls\
  \ out for the great man's talents.\nAccording to this piece about the red tape by\
  \ which our doughty coppers are being strangled, \u201Csome constabularies have\
  \ a 44-page booklet for recording collisions between two cars\u201D. Of course,\
  \ as soon as I read this, my immediate thought was \u201CO Dobson! If thou wert\
  \ with us now!\u201D Rather than subsisting in penury, the pamphleteer could make\
  \ a pretty penny offering his services to these police constabularies. He was capable\
  \ of scribbling a 44-page pamphlet about any subject under the sun as easily as\
  \ you or I could freeze to death in an Antarctic blizzard, and with considerably\
  \ more aplomb. Alas, he passed over to the ethereal realm before getting the chance\
  \ to add to the canon such potential masterworks as An Essay Upon The Unfortunate\
  \ Collision Between A Skoda And A Trabant, or How I Learned About A Terrible Road\
  \ Accident In Which Two Cars Smashed Into Each Other At Inhuman Speed.\nStill, next\
  \ time I am invited to play the parlour game What Would Dobson Do Today?, I think\
  \ I have a good chance of winning top points.\n[2008-01-30]"
