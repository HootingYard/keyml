  Day Two!\u201D Once in a while, however, such an approach is justified, as it is\

  \ all throw our hats in the air and cheer at this achievement. Given that on an\
  \ unlikely number of those days \_the station has played host to Hooting Yard On\
  \ The Air, I ought to take this opportunity to thank the powers that be at the benevolent\

  \ my babbling is audible to the world.\nYou can thank them too, by listening and\
  \ donating and buying things from the shop.\n[2009-03-04]"
