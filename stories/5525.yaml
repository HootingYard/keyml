text: "\nHere is Mick Hartley\u2018s delightful snap of thirteen swans, very neatly\
  \ lined up in a row. They are what we know as self-tidying swans. I checked the\
  \ Swan Register and can confirm that they are, from left to right, Alcibiades, Blinky,\
  \ Clovis, Digby, Eggbound, Flapper, Gertrude, Hoddinott, Icebrain, Jim, Krakatoa,\
  \ Lars and Monique.\nTheir reflections in the pond or mere or lake or gigantic puddle\
  \ are self-tidying water swans, that is, swans made of water, which wobble and shimmer,\
  \ and resist capture. From right to left, according to the Water Swan Register,\
  \ they are Nat, Olive, Popsy, Quetzalcoatl, Rex, Succubus, Totteridge, Ubuntu, Vincenzo,\
  \ Whetstone, Xantippe, Yoko, and Blodwyn.\nThe fact that Blodywn's name is Blodwyn,\
  \ rather than something beginning with Z, suggests that she may not be a self-tidying\
  \ water swan, but rather an interloper. Such swans are commonly termed anomalous\
  \ untidy water swan interlopers. There is no standard Register listing them, although\
  \ volunteers who can devote a few hours per day to the compilation of such a Register\
  \ are always welcome. You will need to be able to tell the difference, at a glance,\
  \ between a swan and a water swan and other avian life-forms that paddle upon inland\
  \ bodies of water.\n[2010-11-05]"
