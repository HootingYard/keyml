  \ 2012 Olympics. Clearly the \xA3400,000 design is a hideous mistake and will have\
  \ to be ditched and replaced at some point within the next five years. My own view\
  \ is that the organising committee ought to take a cheerful, jolly image from an\
  \ already proven successful brand, slap the Olympic rings on it somewhere, and have\
  \ done with it. What could be better than a picture of a lion being attacked by\
  \ a swarm of Africanised killer bees?\n\n[2007-06-21]"
