text: "You don't often come across a Duggleby Bin these days, more's the pity. In\
  \ its time it was a revolutionary new type of waste paper basket, the fad for which\
  \ led to scenes reminiscent of the South Sea Bubble or tulipomania. Duggleby Bins\
  \ would exchange hands for outrageous sums of money, or be bartered for grand houses,\
  \ farmyards, entire fleets of ships, or, in one celebrated case, the monarchy of\
  \ a mountain-girt kingdom shrouded in mystical mists. And then, as suddenly as they\
  \ had become fashionable, so Duggleby Bins were shunned, discarded, abandoned, broken\
  \ up with hammers, and ownership of one became a social gaffe, the cause of mockery\
  \ and disgrace. Nowadays, you can trawl for weeks or months or years through junkyards\
  \ and rubbish tips and never set eyes upon a Duggleby Bin. Rag and bone men who\
  \ will happily clasp to their bosoms the most noisome detritus will look askance\
  \ and pass on to examine something filthy and worm-eaten rather than hoist a Duggleby\
  \ Bin on to their cart.\nIt was with very little publicity, then, that last week\
  \ saw the launch of the Duggleby Bin Appreciation Society. Its mission statement\
  \ says that the Society aims to \u201Crevive, preserve, and enthuse about Duggleby\
  \ Bins\u201D, although a footnote in the inaugural Newsletter reveals that not one\
  \ of the founding members actually owns one, or has ever seen a genuine Duggleby\
  \ Bin. The four po-faced individuals in the official Society photograph pose with\
  \ what appears to be an Etch-a-Sketch rendering of what they imagine a Duggleby\
  \ Bin might look like. It's all rather quaint, and sad. Remember them in your prayers.\n\
