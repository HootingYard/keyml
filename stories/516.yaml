  \ the United States. It is headed \u201CThe Hooting Yard Effect\u201D, and sounds\
  \ a cautionary note for podcast listeners. Here it is, in full:\nDear Mr. Key,\n\
  In late May of this year, I was pointed toward Hooting Yard (in the metaphorical\
  \ sense of having the Hooting Yard podcast suggested to me as an enjoyable listening\
  \ experience, as opposed to the more literal sense of being given directions to\
  \ the physical location of Hooting Yard). After listening to a few shows, and being\
  \ introduced to the works of Dobson, Blodgett, and Pebblehead, learning about Bonkers\
  \ Maisie, Marigold Chew, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, Mrs. Gubbins, and diminutive\
  \ adventuress Tiny Enid, and being exposed to some highly suspect, albeit scrupulously\
  \ alphabetical, soup recipes, I felt a bit lost and resolved that perhaps if I listened\
  \ to the complete archive of Hooting Yard shows, I might gain a more thorough understanding\
  \ of the world of Hooting Yard, and possibly even learn how to spell \u201CBibblybibdib's.\u201D\
  \nI have now completed my task, and in the space of little more than two months,\
  \ have listened to all 140 shows that I was able to find on the internet. Whether\
  \ or not this effort has noticeably improved my understanding of Hooting Yard, its\
  \ environs, and inhabitants is a matter open for debate. However, I have noticed\
  \ an unusual side effect of absorbing so much Hooting Yard over so little a time:\
  \ I find that my \u201Cinternal voice,\u201D when applied to odd bits of prose I\
  \ come across in the course of the day, now sounds exactly like Frank Key.\nFor\
  \ example, I was recently in San Diego, California. In want of something to do,\
  \ wandering the Old Town section, I happened across an old, restored cemetery. Most\
  \ of the graves were marked by blank wooden crosses, with small interpretive signs\
  \ made of deteriorating photocopied text sandwiched between glass plates. One of\
  \ these signs read, as best as I can recall:\n\u201CTHE UNKNOWN GERMAN\n  This grave\
  \ marks the resting place of the Unknown German. This man came to San Diego from\
  \ Germany in 18\u2013 [terminal digits illegible]. Very little is known about his\
  \ life here. How and why he came to San Diego, as well as how he died, is unknown.\u201D\
  \nI read this, silently, to myself. But the voice I heard was plainly Frank Key's.\
  \ This doesn't happen with newspaper articles, magazine stories, street signs, short\
  \ stories, or novels. It occurs only when I read unusual bits of prose like that\
  \ above. I would caution any other Hooting Yard listener contemplating ingesting\
  \ a large amount of your shows in a short period of time. The effect, while not\
  \ unpleasant, is unusual.\nThank you for the hours of entertainment you've provided.\n\
  Very respectfully,\n  Dr Jeffrey Chilton\n[2008-08-21]"
