text: "A letter arrives from OutaSpaceman:\nDear Frank, I have been doing a bit of\
  \ research into Barbaric tribes* and found this paragraph (relating to the Visigoths)\
  \ on the hhg2g site:\n\u201CThere was still time for one last Gothic comedy. The\
  \ panicking King Wamba called up priests to the army to prepare for a full-scale\
  \ Moorish invasion, but the newly armed priests threw their lot in with a group\
  \ of revolutionary nobles. In what must be one of the most bizarre coups of all\
  \ time, Wamba was drugged and dressed as a monk. The rebels also shaved his head,\
  \ because to the Visigoths long hair was a symbol of sovereignty. The embarrassed\
  \ king stood aside for the rebel leader Ervigius. Then, when Ervigius\u2019 grandson\
  \ Witiza died, a brief civil war of succession put King Roderick on the throne in\
  \ 710 in place of Witiza's son, Achila. It was an inauspicious year for the Visigoths.\u201D\
  \nOh, to be ruled by Panicking King Wamba\u2026\nYours, OutaSpaceman\n*This is considered\
  \ to be the finest opening line of any letter Mr Key has ever received.\n[2009-02-05]"
