text: "Long, long ago, my friend Phil and I decided to make our fortunes in the music\
  \ business. Lacking the ability to sing or to play an instrument, we determined\
  \ to be managers. We envisaged ourselves as a pair of Svengalis, with a stable of\
  \ artists who would conquer the charts, allowing us to retire to Bransonian tropical\
  \ islands before our thirtieth birthdays.\nHow could things possibly go wrong?,\
  \ we thought, considering the first bands on our roster. There was Snakewizard,\
  \ a generic heavy metal band of no great originality\u2014but then, originality\
  \ is the last thing the punters want in a heavy metal group. We would help them\
  \ along with song lyrics, but otherwise leave them to practise their deafening din\
  \ and grow their hair.\nThe important thing was to have a broad range of artists,\
  \ covering different markets. Snakewizard took care of the heavy metal fans, and\
  \ our second group\u2014The Toofles\u2014appealed to a wholly different audience.\
  \ The Toofles were essentially a novelty band for pre-teens, not unlike The Wombles.\
  \ Their songs had no artistic merit whatsoever but, we thought, would be wildly\
  \ popular with the tinies.\nThe fatal flaw in our scheme, and the reason that the\
  \ Bransonian islands remained forever out of reach, was that neither Snakewizard\
  \ nor The Toofles ever existed outside our pulsating greedy brains. They were only\
  \ ever figments of our imagination \u2026 where they remain lodged, now grown old\
  \ and grey, and without a back catalogue\u2014or indeed any catalogue at all\u2014\
  to fall back on.\nThey are still two of my favourite groups.\n[2015-02-04]"
