text: "One of the more startling works of Dobson was the text often called \u201C\
  the joke pamphlet\u201D, dubbed such because its opening lines are almost identical\
  \ to one of those gags that begins \u201CThere was an Englishman, an Irishman, and\
  \ a Scotchman\u2026\u201D It is the least-read of Dobson's pamphlets by a long chalk.\
  \ Some think this may be due to the work itself being thought a joke, perpetrated\
  \ by an anti-Dobsonist, and thus not part of the canon. Equally, it could be argued\
  \ that the very rarity of the pamphlet has led to it being neglected. Most estimates\
  \ conclude that only three copies were bashed out on Marigold Chew's Gestetner machine\
  \ in her crumbling shed.\nThe pamphlet begins thus:\nThere was a thnetopsychist,\
  \ a psychopannychist, and an annihilationist, and they were loitering in a graveyard.\
  \ The thnetopsychist held that the souls of persons and beasts perish along with\
  \ their physical bodies, and that both body and soul are resurrected at the Last\
  \ Judgement. The psychopannychist believed that the soul sleeps in the grave, to\
  \ be awoken at the End . The annihilationist, as his name indicated, said that there\
  \ was no resurrection at all, for either the body or the soul.\nClearly, any sensitive\
  \ reader would not be expecting Dobson to follow this with a comic punchline. This\
  \ is a serious pamphlet by a serious pamphleteer. There follows a lengthy conversation\
  \ between the trio, written in stilted, artificial, and highly-wrought prose, which\
  \ Dobson disastrously tries to render in a variety of regional accents, choosing\
  \ regions where he had never been, and of which he knew nothing. Indeed, it may\
  \ be that the pamphlet has attracted so few readers because it is virtually unreadable.\n\
  But, as ever with the out of print pamphleteer, persistence pays off. Ted Cack has\
  \ gone so far as to claim that it is Dobson's finest, bravest, most valiant work,\
  \ but he is probably just showing off.\nOne might be forgiven for thinking that\
  \ the conversation between the thnetopsychist, the psychopannychist, and the annihilationist,\
  \ which makes up the bulk of the pamphlet, consists of each arguing their case against\
  \ the other. But it swiftly becomes apparent that this is not Dobson's purpose at\
  \ all. Well, it becomes swiftly apparent once one gets to grips with the tortured\
  \ prose, but if one has to struggle it becomes slowly apparent. (In my case, it\
  \ took about seven years hard slog, sitting up all night reading by the light of\
  \ tallow candles, shivering in a blanket, to reach a vague understanding of this\
  \ mighty text.) Rather than a standard mortalist debate about the fate of the body\
  \ and soul after death, we are treated to a sequence of what can only be called\
  \ rants by the three protagonists upon familiar Dobsonian themes\u2014shipping timetables,\
  \ foreign boot manufacture, breathtaking ornithological ignorance, and so on\u2014\
  interspersed with passages in which ghouls rise from the tombs in the graveyard\
  \ and dance a sort of tarantella.\nObviously, the pamphleteer is playing with his\
  \ readers here in a quite un-Dobsonish manner. Our moorings are loosened, and we\
  \ are set adrift. We wonder, or at least I wondered, by about page 44, if we were\
  \ heading for a maelstrom, like something out of Edgar Allan Poe. We cling on, though,\
  \ trusting in Dobson to rescue us. And rescue us he does.\nIn the final pages of\
  \ the pamphlet, the dancing ghouls harry the thnetopsychist into one of the graves,\
  \ chop up the psychopannychist with their ghoul-axes, and hoist the annihilationist\
  \ up a gum tree which just happens to be growing in a corner of the graveyard and\
  \ which we have glimpsed, briefly, earlier in the text, when one of the protagonists\u2014\
  it is not clear which, given the stultifying density of the prose\u2014shins up\
  \ it and taps it for gum to make a point about tapping gum from gum trees. The ghouls\
  \ then do a final little dance\u2014more a hopping about, in truth\u2014before returning\
  \ to their tombs. But of course, one tomb is newly occupied by the stricken thnetopsychist,\
  \ leaving a single ghoul with nowhere to rest. This ghoul wanders out of the graveyard,\
  \ through the grim iron gates, past the cake shop and the colonic irrigation theme\
  \ park and the butcher's and the performing pinhead person's plinth, and then vanishes\
  \ into a mist, a mist reminiscent of the one that swallows up Arthur Gordon Pym\
  \ of Nantucket. The ghoul is bound we know not where, and nor does Dobson tell us.\n\
  It is, in short, a tour de force, albeit one that is maddeningly difficult to make\
  \ sense of. Oddly, not one of the giants of prog rock ever adapted it for a concept\
  \ album. One can only imagine what a terrific gatefold sleeve would have been designed\
  \ for the original vinyl release, and with what vim adenoidal youths would have\
  \ carved Dobson's name into their school desks with a penknife. Is there, one wonders,\
  \ a parallel universe where such things came to be? And is there a piece of boffinry\
  \ that could take us there, away, away\u2026 away from the sludge and gristle of\
  \ our hapless hell?\n[2009-03-07]"
