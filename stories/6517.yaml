text: "Earlier today I was rummaging in the ReR Megacorp catalogue when I discovered,\
  \ somewhat to my astonishment, that Mr Cutler's emporium has \u201Ca few copies\u201D\
  \ of House Of Turps for sale.\n\nHe describes it as \u201Cclassic Oulipoesque Keyiana\u201D\
  \ which is fairly accurate. It is a booklet originally published by the Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press in 1987, although the copies available may be from a second print-run made\
  \ as the \u201Cgift item\u201D appended to subscribers\u2019 copies of one of the\
  \ legendary ReR Quarterlies. (Incidentally, besotted devotees may wish to snap up\
  \ the entire collection of Quarterlies, two sets of which also seem to be available.)\n\
  Here, then, is your chance to clasp to your heaving bosom a true rarity, nigh on\
  \ a quarter of a century old. I suggest you hie hence and place your order and send\
  \ Mr Cutler your monies.\n[2011-04-27]"
