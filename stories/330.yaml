text: "How right I was to predict that the Beecam would derail my harebrained scheme\
  \ to make Hooting Yard a daily blog! Here is what happened yesterday:\n5.15 AM\_\
  : Leap out of bed and plump myself in front of the beecam. Become enthralled.\n\
  7.24 AM\_: Consider basic needs, such as washing and dressing and eating a hearty\
  \ breakfast of kedgeree and bloaters and smokers\u2019 poptarts, but am so overwhelmed\
  \ by the beecam that I postpone any activity.\n11.45 AM\_: Bee-haunted.\n3.00 PM\_\
  : Numb to the human world. Beginning to think like a bee. Making occasional buzzing\
  \ noises.\n3.14 PM\_: Nip away from the beecam momentarily to don yellow-and-black\
  \ striped leotard and black hat with antennae.\n7.52 PM\_: Recall that I planned\
  \ to write something daily for the Hooting Yard page. Am too transfixed by the beecam\
  \ to move.\n11.35 PM\_: Realise that I have spent the entire day observing either\
  \ bees or the absence of bees on the beecam. Suffused with a warm glow of bee-ness.\
  \ Continue to watch bees with now bleary eyes. Make a mental note to explain to\
  \ readers that \u201Cbleary-eyed\u201D has nothing to do with terrifying diminutive\
  \ MP Hazel Blears.\n1.07 AM\_: Drag myself reluctantly from beecam to bed. As I\
  \ fall asleep, reflect upon the fact that I have never had so bee-centred a day\
  \ as the day just gone. Resolve to be even more bee-minded in future.\n[2008-01-04]"
