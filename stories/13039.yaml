text: "It was time, I decided, for a brisk splosh, so I went to find a puddle. The\
  \ deeper the puddle, the sploshier the splosh, as Curbingham reminds us. What you\
  \ do not want to do, however, is to mistake, for a deep puddle, an unusually small\
  \ yet unexpectedly deep pond, or mere, or cwm, or, great heavens to Betsy!, a waterlogged\
  \ bottomless viper pit. For that reason it is wise to arm yourself, before setting\
  \ out, or somewhere along the way, with a stick. The stick ought to be stout and\
  \ of a certain length, such that, when one end of the stick is placed on the ground,\
  \ and the stick held vertically, the other end is no higher than the top of your\
  \ head. Then, when you probe the puddle with the stick, you will be able to judge\
  \ its depth in relation to your own height. The basic idea is that you do not find\
  \ yourself making a brisk splosh in a body of water so deep that the top of your\
  \ head will vanish below the surface, till human voices wake you, and you drown.\
  \ That is not a splosh\u2014it is tomfoolery, and perilously so.\nOn the day I am\
  \ telling you about, I neglected to heed my own advice, and I did not have a stick\
  \ about my person when I arrived at what I took to be an apt puddle. It was in the\
  \ middle of a bosky lane stretching from Loopy Copse to the godforsaken piggery\
  \ at Mustard Parva. I judged it to be a recent puddle, taking into account the meteorological\
  \ conditions and the time of day, which, looking at my wristwatch, I had as 7.45\
  \ a.m.. This was erroneous. Unbeknown to me, my watch was running fast, and the\
  \ true time was more likely somewhere between twenty to thirty minutes earlier.\n\
  Taken all in all, my having the wrong time was of no relevance vis-\xE0-vis\_the\
  \ depth of the puddle, but it was, I think, symptomatic of my jumbleheadedness that\
  \ morning. There was also my failure to obtain a stick, as noted, and the fact that\
  \ I had had only one sausage rather than the usual two for my breakfast, which played\
  \ havoc with my innards, including the brain. I am a creature of habit.\nThis is\
  \ not the place to indulge in a rant about the caf\xE9, which had so mismanaged\
  \ its affairs that it was exhausted of sausages at 7.00 a.m. by my watch, or roughly\
  \ 6.35 a.m. in brute reality. Or, contrarily, perhaps this is the very place to\
  \ cast anathemas upon Mr Boggis and his helpmeets at the caf\xE9 Where else am I\
  \ to give vent to my exasperation? When I was told there was only a single sausage\
  \ left on the premises, so early in the day, I suggested to Mr Boggis that he might\
  \ send one of the helpmeets to replenish the supplies. Where, he asked me, did I\
  \ think it possible to get hold of dozens of sausages at such an early hour? This\
  \ had me stumped, for I know nothing of the wholesale sausage business, as why should\
  \ I? Unable to frame a coherent response, I babbled invective and tore my paper\
  \ napkin to shreds. Mr Boggis disappeared into the kitchen. When, shortly afterwards,\
  \ he returned with the last sausage on a plate, I announced that \u201Cgoing forward\u201D\
  , as is the phrase nowadays, I would be taking my breakfast elsewhere. He reminded\
  \ me that Tuck In With Mr Boggis was the only caf\xE9 for miles upon miles in any\
  \ direction, and certainly the only one within walking distance of my hovel. I think,\
  \ he said provocatively, you will find a rather gruesome cafeteria at Sawdust Bridge\
  \ station, far far away at the other end of the branch line, should you wish to\
  \ make a lengthy and expensive railway journey before breakfast every morning. For\
  \ the second time in as many minutes I was stumped. I decided to eat my sausage\
  \ in silence, and it was while doing so that it occurred to me the best way to shake\
  \ off my feelings of distress, dejection, and incandescent rage was to go for a\
  \ brisk splosh.\nWhich brings us neatly back to the scene on the bosky lane. There\
  \ I was, stickless, anent a puddle. I was confident it was a suitable sploshing\
  \ puddle, and not something in which I might drown. Burned into my brain is a map\
  \ of the several bottomless viper pits dotted hither and thither between Loopy Copse\
  \ and the godforsaken piggery at Mustard Parva, and by getting my bearings from\
  \ a study of the time and the sun and the trees and the compass stored in the heel\
  \ of my boot I was able to ascertain that the puddle could not possibly be one of\
  \ the bottomless viper pits, filled to the brim with rainwater. It was safe to splosh.\n\
  Curbingham has given us the most comprehensive list of the benefits of a brisk splosh\
  \ in a puddle. I long ago committed his list to memory, and I rehearsed it now,\
  \ as a chaffinch or something similar started chirruping in a nearby tree. When,\
  \ eventually, I was completely \u201Cin the zone\u201D, I leapt into the puddle.\
  \ But it was not a puddle! I landed on something solid, with a clang, and sprained\
  \ my ankle. Sprawled in the lane, weeping with the sudden spasm of pain, I noticed,\
  \ for the first time, a small metal plaque embedded in the earth a few inches away.\
  \ Engraved upon it were the words Transgressive Rustic Fixture\_: Trompe L'oeil\
  \ Puddle VII by Cosmo Hoxtonwanker. I had been undone by art!\nWhat I had thought\
  \ to be a puddle was in fact a construction of glass and metal and light-reflecting\
  \ booster technology, commissioned by the municipality, for which they had paid\
  \ a preposterous amount of money. I learned as much from Mr Boggis, to whose caf\xE9\
  \ I limped back after binding my ankle with a filthy rag I found discarded in a\
  \ real puddle a few yards down the lane. Mr Boggis, it turned out, was not only\
  \ the proprietor of a newly sausageless caf\xE9, but an alderman on the parish council\
  \ and an aficionado of transgressive rustic fixture artworks. It was he who had\
  \ hoo ha hee hop hig hub haw hee hoo ha . . . dammit. This is what art does to me.\
  \ It sprains my ankle and turns my brain to jelly. What I need is a brisk splosh\
  \ in a puddle. And a second sausage.\n[2014-08-15]"
