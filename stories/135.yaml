text: "As promised last week, here is the first in a series of Hooting Yard auctions.\
  \ This is in the way of an experiment. I might use eBay in future, but I thought\
  \ I'd keep this one on home turf and see what happens. Unlike the Resonance auctions,\
  \ proceeds of this one go to the Hooting Yard Mercy Fund For Distressed Out Of Print\
  \ Pamphleteers. Make your bid(s) in the Comments. Closing date is a week's time,\
  \ midnight on Sunday 1st April.\nAnd what are you bidding for? A mint copy of Sidney\
  \ The Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin, which Mr Key will sign and add a note thanking\
  \ the successful bidder. A5, 8 pages, illustrated, originally produced for the legendary\
  \ Counter Productions\u2019 Yuletide World o\u2019 Wonders box in 1990.\n\n[2007-03-25]"
