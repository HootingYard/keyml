text: "This morning I learned, a tad belatedly, that Hooting Yard has been voted 64th\
  \ in a list of the Top 100 Liberal Democrat blogs. I confess to being utterly beflummoxed\
  \ by this news, chiefly because I'm not a Liberal Democrat, have never voted Liberal\
  \ Democrat, and doubt that I ever would vote Liberal Democrat. In the unlikely event\
  \ that the \u201Cvotes\u201D cast in this poll were the result of human agency,\
  \ as opposed to a fiendish electronic crunching exercise, then I applaud the good\
  \ sense of those who voted. To reciprocate, here at Hooting Yard we did a quick\
  \ straw poll to vote on our favourite Liberal Democrat. No prizes for guessing that\
  \ the winner is, of course, Lembit Opik.\nOne brief footnote: while we're on the\
  \ subject of party politics, I am reliably informed that Michael Meacher keeps an\
  \ A3 copy of the famous Hooting Yard Pontiff Mnemonic on his office wall.\n[2007-10-10]"
