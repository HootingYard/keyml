text: "There is a simple explanation for the quietness which has stolen over your\
  \ favourite website in the past few days. I have been immersing myself in the films\
  \ of Guy Maddin, for me the greatest living genius working in cinema. I first enthused\
  \ about him here in the summer of 2008, when I saw Brand Upon The Brain! and I am\
  \ now, through the magic of Het Internet, catching up with as much of his work as\
  \ I can.\nFor all the echoes of early cinema, his films are sui generis. His is\
  \ an absolutely individual talent, to the point where one could say a single shot\
  \ could not be mistaken for the work of another director. Melodrama, ice hockey,\
  \ sexual obsession, Winnipeg, dreams, amnesia\u2026 just some of the joys of a Guy\
  \ Maddin film. And let us not forget that he can be deliriously funny.\nHere is\
  \ Odin's Shield Maiden, a short from 2007.\n[2011-02-13]"
