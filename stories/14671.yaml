text: "Most buffers are not squelchy, but some are, some are. I am thinking, in particular,\
  \ of the buffers in the submerged portion at the end of the line at Pointy Town.\
  \ They are not just squelchy buffers, they are very squelchy buffers, at times exceedingly\
  \ so, Adding to their squelchiness is the fact that the approach to the buffers,\
  \ for several hundred plodes, is equipped, at regular intervals, with baffles, of\
  \ both metal and sponge. The baffles first appear in the unsubmerged portion of\
  \ the line but continue in the submerged portion until we are within spitting distance\
  \ of the squelchy buffers themselves. Not that we would actually spit, for that\
  \ would contravene the by-laws, unsurprisingly.\nThe poet-in-residence at Pointy\
  \ Town Terminus, Dennis Beerpint, has recently published an anthology entitled Shall\
  \ I compare thee to a squelchy buffer?, the answer to which would appear to be \u201C\
  no, I would rather you didn't\u201D (see Canto XXVII in the collection). Beerpint\
  \ spent many long hours perched on a camping-stool, half-submerged, close by the\
  \ squelchy buffers, smoking his pipe and jotting down his matchless poetic aper\xE7\
  us with a propelling pencil in a notepad. Curiously, he had nothing whatsoever to\
  \ say about the metal and sponge baffles, although it is possible he is saving them\
  \ for a second anthology which, like the first, will be available at the Pointy\
  \ Town Terminus Kiosk.\nHoplites often disport themselves near the squelchy buffers,\
  \ in historical reenactment tableaux vivants, but they do not hop.\nOccasionally,\
  \ it has been remarked that prose will simply peter out.\n[2016-03-31]"
