text: "Max uses visualization and mime to inspire Wiky when they dance. \u201CI'll\
  \ think of a sparkling river, and before I've even begun to mime paddling down it,\
  \ Wiky has become a leaping fish. That may make me think of a crocodile eating her,\
  \ but just as I begin jaw snapping, she becomes a fluttering bird trying to distract\
  \ me. It's a very stimulating technique, but you have to be careful. Once when we\
  \ were dancing I visualized a bright red rose and then the fleeting image of a speeding\
  \ red sports car entered my mind. At that very moment Wiky leapt sideways and crashed\
  \ into the bookcase, which completely wrecked the dance sequence, not to mention\
  \ one of my mother's vases. I've spoken to other dance visualizers about this and\
  \ the general consensus is that she responded to the flower as a bee and then had\
  \ no time to change roles when the sports car came along. Her only course was to\
  \ take evasive action.\u201D\nWiky, you will be delighted to learn, is a cat. She\
  \ is among a number of cats\u2014including Nijinskat, Fluff, Boots, Zoot, Archie\
  \ and Toffee\u2014featured in the magisterially twaddle-packed book Dancing With\
  \ Cats (1999) by Burton Silver and Heather Busch, authors of Why Cats Paint (1994).\n\
  Pansy Cradledew was excited to find this book for just 30p in her local library\
  \ sale, and declares it to be possibly the best book bargain she has ever snapped\
  \ up. You just know you're in for a treat from the opening sentence of the Foreword\
  \ by Swami Shakya Bahrain, Spiritual Healer, who declares \u201CFor some years now,\
  \ a new consciousness has been entering our world, a new understanding of the energy\
  \ fields that tie us and all\u2026\u201D\u2014sorry, I fell into a doze there for\
  \ a moment. Anyway, what we have is over one hundred pages filled with crackpots\
  \ talking about dancing with their cats, accompanied by glorious colour photographs\
  \ of said dances. For some reason an integral part of the pastime appears to be\
  \ that the human dancer is dressed foolishly.\nThose of you keen to pursue the activity\u2014\
  whether or not your cat bashes into the bookcase\u2014may wish to visit this somewhat\
  \ alarming website.\n[2011-12-18]"
