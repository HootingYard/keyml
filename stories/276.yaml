text: "While we are on the subject of gormlessness, I think praise is due to John\
  \ Philbin, the man who organised the completely fake press conference for the US\
  \ government agency Fema. No reporters turned up for the last minute briefing, so\
  \ the resourceful Mr Philbin got agency staff to pose as hacks and ask questions.\
  \ When the ruse was exposed, he explained: \u201CI did not have good situational\
  \ awareness of what was happening\u201D. This seems to me to be a splendid way of\
  \ saying \u201CI haven't got a clue what's going on\u201D, and I intend to use it\
  \ often as I bumble through life perplexed and befuddled, as I do. I think it will\
  \ also be a good idea to retitle the story below Tiny Enid And The Nipper With Poor\
  \ Situational Awareness.\n[2007-11-01]"
