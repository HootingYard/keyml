  E. de Jongh, cited in The Embarrassment Of Riches\_: An Interpretation Of Dutch\
  \ Culture In The Golden Age (1987) by Simon Schama. Lucky for me that I did not\
  \ live in that place at that time, as my own consumption of cheese is pursued almost\
  \ exclusively on an allegorical level. I shall have more to say on this matter shortly.\n\
