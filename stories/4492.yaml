  \ within 1.7536284 seconds), there is the source blazoned upon your screen. It is\
  \ all very well pleading with you not to cheat, but the fact that you can discover\
  \ the answer for yourself after whatever brain-wracking time you choose to allow\
  \ inevitably puts a dampener on things.\nAnyway, my not-quite-a-quiz is as follows:\n\
  Who wrote \u201D I am you. Yes, you\u2014that whole great majestically startling\
  \ mentally epic burning model of heaven.\u201D?\nThe first time I read that string\
  \ of adjectives I gasped with glee.\nADDENDUM\_: \u201CHis eyes are bulging like\
