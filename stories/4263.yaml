text: "I'm so happy, I'm dancing a jig. Why am I happy? Because I rented a pig. It's\
  \ a highly intelligent, modern pig. Hey, daddy-o, it flips my wig.\nWhen you hire\
  \ a pig on a rental scheme, it can be like a pig in an opiate dream\u2014the kind\
  \ of pig S T Coleridge'd invent, or De Quincey, perhaps, if he could afford the\
  \ rent.\nFor a rented pig does not come cheap. It costs a tremendous amount to keep.\
  \ There's the sty and the swill and the brain scans to pay, and bales of straw and\
  \ bales of hay.\nBut a modern intelligent pig is a treasure, a joy and a boon quite\
  \ beyond measure. A pig is a must. A pig is the top. Rent one, as I did, from a\
  \ pig hire shop!\n[2010-04-14]"
