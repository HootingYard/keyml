text: "Following yesterday's note about three-letter place names, I feel I must enthuse\
  \ about, and recommend, the latest addition to the groaning bookshelves at Haemoglobin\
  \ Towers. I have only just started to read McKie's Gazetteer\_: A Local History\
  \ Of Britain, and am smitten (as I knew I would be). David McKie's book is not a\
  \ comprehensive guide, but a series of essays about places that have caught his\
  \ interest for one reason or another. The piece on Aberdeen, for example, is largely\
  \ devoted to a potted biography of Alexander Cruden, the self-styled \u201CAlexander\
  \ The Corrector\u201D, compiler of one of the most demented works of scholarship\
  \ ever fashioned, the Complete Concordance To The Holy Scriptures.\nI clapped my\
  \ hands in glee to discover that Jaywick had not escaped McKie's attention. Though\
  \ he does not mention the day the cows came visiting, he is a fount of information\
  \ on that ill-starred seaside resort, including the fact that it was founded by\
  \ a man whose nickname was Foff.\nIf you need any further persuading to buy this\
  \ excellent book, bear in mind that David McKie used to write the Smallweed and\
  \ McElsewhere columns in the Guardian, where, more than once, he made mention of\
  \ Hooting Yard. Clearly a very sensible man.\n[2008-10-03]"
