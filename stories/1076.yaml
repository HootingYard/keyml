text: 'Apparently, if you use Lulu''s super-duper extra fast express uberexpensive
  delivery option, it is Not Too Late to receive copies of Hooting Yard books in time
  for Christmas. (While we are on the subject, I would like to point out that I insist
  on calling Christmas Christmas rather than one of those wretched multi-or-no-faith
  euphemisms which are, as we know, abominations not to be tolerated.) So to avoid
  being faced with sulky disappointed relatives and friends on Christmas Day, go here
  and order your copies right this minute.
