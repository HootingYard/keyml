text: "I was out one day observing birds when I saw what I considered to be a particularly\
  \ sparky little plover. I said as much to my walking companion, Dulcie The Bird\
  \ Woman.\n\u201CLook, Dulcie!\u201D I said, pointing, \u201CIs that not a sparky\
  \ plover?\u201D I pronounced plover to rhyme with the plant, clover.\n\u201CI think\
  \ you will find,\u201D hissed Dulcie The Bird Woman, whose every utterance was a\
  \ hiss, \u201CThat it is pronounced plover to rhyme with the trade of glover, a\
  \ man who maketh gloves. But be that as it may, what could possibly lead you to\
  \ dub it sparky? It is not shooting forth sparks, and if it were, I think the both\
  \ of us would be mightily disconcerted.\u201D\n\u201CI was using the word sparky\
  \ as Father Hopkins deployed it in his juvenile verse drama Floris In Italy,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CWhere he writes Such spiders web he ties across his sight, insert\
  \ ellipsis, Gilds with some sparky fancies blinding night, where sparky is a synonym\
  \ for lively or vivacious. It is in the same sense it was used as the name of a\
  \ weekly children's comic I used occasionally to read when I was a tot.\u201D\n\u201C\
  A different sense, then, to the spark translated from the Russian Iskra, which was\
  \ no children's comic but an organ of Bolshevik propaganda in pre-revolutionary\
  \ Russia,\u201D hissed Dulcie, who was surprisingly erudite in many matters not\
  \ relating directly to birds.\n\u201CI wouldn't know about that,\u201D I said, \u201C\
  I am woefully ignorant of Bolshevism.\u201D\nWe were standing, having paused to\
  \ take in the plover, on a path winding alongside an estuary. Scattered here and\
  \ there beside the path were the stumps of unknown trees. Dulcie The Bird Woman\
  \ sat down on one, and took from her bag a greaseproof paper package containing\
  \ a sandwich.\n\u201COf course,\u201D she hissed, between munches, \u201CA robot\
  \ plover might emit sparks, had something gone awry with its wiring. But only a\
  \ fool would build such a robot.\u201D\nI nodded. I had not brought any sandwiches\
  \ with me, for I was feckless.\n\u201CI have to say,\u201D continued Dulcie, \u201C\
  That your plover seems neither more nor less lively and vivacious than any other\
  \ plover, nor indeed than any other wading bird. It is merely going about its business\
  \ in the shallows at the edge of the estuary.\u201D\n\u201CIt is not my plover,\u201D\
  \ I protested.\nShe fixed me with an odd, somehow menacing, look, as she swallowed\
  \ the last of her sandwich.\n\u201CAre you quite sure of that?\u201D she hissed.\n\
  \u201CIt is merely a plover I spotted and described as sparky,\u201D I said, \u201C\
  Why would I lay any further claim to it?\u201D\nDulcie The Bird Woman chuckled to\
  \ herself, then hissed:\n\u201CIt was said, of both Rudolf Steiner and Chou En-lai,\
  \ that they seemed to emit flashes of mysterious light. Perhaps your sparky plover,\
  \ too, is such a marvel. Look!\u201D\nI was already looking at the plover, and sure\
  \ enough, it suddenly cast forth a flash of glittering effulgence, a brilliant radiance\
  \ that would have blinded me had I not turned my head away and shut my eyes. When\
  \ I opened them again, I saw that Dulcie had put on a pair of sunglasses and was\
  \ eating a plum.\n\u201CThat is a very interesting bird,\u201D she hissed, \u201C\
  You were right to point it out, it alone, among all the other plovers and dotterels\
  \ and wading birds. Here, take this net, and bag your sparky plover, and take it\
  \ home with you. It will not resist. It is your bird-familiar.\u201D\nI had no idea\
  \ what she was talking about, but, as if in a dream, I took the net she had drawn\
  \ out of her pippy bag, and I scampered off toward the shoreline, toward the plover.\
  \ Was it really mine? Was it really my familiar?\nAs I closed upon it, fanning out\
  \ the net, it again shot forth a flash of incandescent light, and in that moment\
  \ it seemed I and the bird and the light were all one. Was it a moment, or was it\
  \ a year, a century, a millennium? I could not tell. But when the light faded, I\
  \ dug my short stubby bill into the sand and pulled out a juicy worm, and as I guzzled\
  \ it down I looked up and saw, sitting on the stump of an unknown tree, a woman.\
  \ She stood up, hoisted a bag over her shoulder, and, before walking away, she chucked\
  \ a plumstone at me. It missed me by a whisker.\n[2013-02-25]"
