text: "Here is a spot of small press publishing history, which might be of vague interest\
  \ to a few readers.\n\u2018Twas long, long ago, in the autumn of 1986 that my pal\
  \ Max D\xE9charn\xE9 and I conceived the idea of publishing an anthology of our\
  \ various drivellings. A decade earlier, Max had been a great enthusiast of punk\
  \ and the DIY approach to making records\u2014he realised his ambition of releasing\
  \ a single while still in his teens. Why not do the same with the printed word?\
  \ Neither of us, I think, was particularly aware of the thriving small press scene\
  \ then extant, but we were only too conscious that I had a job in an office with\
  \ a big humming photocopier to which I had access at weekends. We assembled fifty\
  \ pages each of material, typed it out on an electronic typewriter, worked out the\
  \ pagination by making a little dummy booklet, and voila!, we had an anthology.\
  \ All we needed now was a title and a name for our imprint. Max had a job at the\
  \ time which he absolutely loathed, and entertained murderous fantasies about his\
  \ boss. Thus Stab Your Employer popped into his head without too much struggle.\
  \ In the course of a phone call during which we discussed what to call ourselves,\
  \ I cast my eyes along the bookshelf and spotted Malice Aforethought by Francis\
  \ Iles. Hence the name of the Press was born. In retrospect, this does not seem\
  \ a fortuitous choice, too redolent of an imprint dedicated to crime fiction. But\
  \ we were young and stupid and impulsive, I suppose.\nOne hefty bout of illegal\
  \ weekend photocopying later, we had fifty fat but spineless one-hundred-page booklets\
  \ for sale. Ah yes, sales. Who on earth we imagined might buy this work of matchless\
  \ genius, other than our friends and acquaintances, I cannot recall. Some copies\
  \ we sent out on spec to persons we admired, to be met, of course, with resounding\
  \ indifference\u2014except in one case. Max had developed a great liking for the\
  \ works issued by Atlas Press, and popped a copy of Stab Your Employer in the post\
  \ to them. I do not think we understood at the time that Atlas was a shoestring\
  \ operation with resources only marginally better than our own. As far as I know,\
  \ what happened next was that Alasdair Brotchie of Atlas passed the booklet on to\
  \ his friend, the artist Jane Colling, and Jane in turn brought it to the attention\
  \ of her friend Chris Cutler, the drummer, one-time member of Henry Cow, and onlie\
  \ begetter of Recommended Records. Chris was then in the early years of producing\
  \ the ReR Quarterly, a printed-magazine-with-LP. Something I had written must have\
  \ appealed to him, for I was then asked to contribute a piece for the Quarterly.\
  \ Chris did not ask me himself, but delegated the request to a young man acting\
  \ as a sort of typist/factotum for Recommended, Ed Baxter\u2014who is today the\
  \ benevolent dictator at the head of Resonance104.4FM. Thus were connections made\
  \ that in some cases last to this day.\nMax and I rattled off a second anthology,\
  \ Smooching With Istvan, early in 1987. (It is in this booklet that \u201CHooting\
  \ Yard\u201D made its very first appearance, as recalled here.) Inspired by the\
  \ sheer ease of producing works\u2014though we did start paying for photocopying\u2014\
  we bashed out lots of pamphlets over the next couple of years. (There is a complete\
  \ list of my own stuff here.) At the same time, Ed Baxter was tirelessly bringing\
  \ into being the Small Press Group, along with allies such as Atlas and, from an\
  \ older generation, the legendary John Nicholson. Max and I became keen and, I hope,\
  \ useful members of the group, which arranged book fairs and published three, or\
  \ possibly four, paperback Small Press Yearbooks. These directories, which included\
  \ how-to-do-it guides and much else, stand as a fascinating record of activity in\
  \ the last years before Het Internet changed the landscape.\nThough Max and I never\
  \ actually collaborated again\u2014and, in truth, both Stab Your Employer and Smooching\
  \ With Istvan simply jammed our individual pieces between the same covers\u2014\
  \ we issued our own works and expanded the press to publish others. These included\
  \ Ginseng Fuchsia Lefleur, a Small Press Group friend from Canada, whose North American\
  \ Freestyle Playpen Zen is possibly the rarest of all Malice Aforethought Press\
  \ pamphlets\u2014consider yourself very fortunate if you own a copy. I also fell\
  \ in with Ellis Sharp, latterly of Zoilus Press and a great favourite of the Grauniad's\
  \ Nicholas Lezard. Ellis lived near me and my ex-wife used to cut his hair. She\
  \ introduced us, and I think we were both surprised that we liked each other's work.\
  \ General Jaruzelski's Sunglasses was the first Ellis Sharp work we published\u2014\
  the first piece credited to \u201CEllis Sharp\u201D ever\u2014and several more followed.\
  \ It is as rare, I suspect, as Ms Lefleur's outpouring. Bear in mind that many of\
  \ these pamphlets came in editions of twenty-five, or even fewer. (I think one of\
  \ my own pamphlets was limited to a dozen copies.)\nThe final Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press publications were \u201Cproper\u201D paperbacks\u2014my own Twitching And\
  \ Shattered, Max's Beat Your Relatives To A Bloody Pulp and The Prisoner Of Brenda,\
  \ and a couple of one-offs. Probably the finest thing we ever published was a selection\
  \ of work by the great John Bently of Liver And Lights, another Small Press Group\
  \ hero. The last book, which Max alone brought into being, was a collection by a\
  \ member of the beat combo Fortran Five. My memory of this last is hazy, because\
  \ I was whirling ever more rapidly towards the Wilderness Years. By the time I emerged\
  \ from them, Het Internet had taken over the world, which was now, at last, ready\
  \ for the true emergence of Hooting Yard.\nI sometimes wonder what might have happened\u2014\
  or not happened\u2014had Max not sent a copy of Stab Your Employer to Atlas.\n[2012-04-16]"
