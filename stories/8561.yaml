text: "Apropos of nothing in particular, I thought I would share with you an inexplicable\
  \ ornithological mixup which occurred some twenty years ago. I was constructing\
  \ a set of twenty-six alphabetical drawings, and decided that O would stand for\
  \ Ortolan. How I arrived at this word without knowing what it meant I cannot recall.\
  \ Anyway, I looked it up and learned that Ortolan was a synonym for Bunting. I then\
  \ drew a picture of a string of triangular flags such as one might find at an outdoor\
  \ gala. Only after the picture had been published, along with its twenty-five compadres,\
  \ in the big fat paperback Small Press Yearbook (date forgotten, but circa 1990)\
  \ did I discover that the Bunting in question was not flags but a bird. As readers\
  \ know, since the last century my ornithological erudition has progressed by leaps\
  \ and bounds and little birdy hops \xE0\_la the robin. I cannot find a copy of my\
  \ drawing, so these snaps, from here and here, must suffice.\n\nBunting, but not\
  \ Ortolan\n\nBoth Bunting and Ortolan\n[2012-03-09]"
