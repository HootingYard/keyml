text: "Were he still among the living, my father would have been celebrating his eighty-fifth\
  \ birthday today. And were the thirty-seventh Potus still with us, he\u2014Richard\
  \ Milhous Nixon\u2014would have been celebrating his ninety-seventh birthday. I\
  \ had not previously realised that my Pa was exactly twelve years younger than Nixon.\
  \ If I were a different kind of writer, I might make much of this, and embark upon\
  \ a dazzling doublefold psychological study, of thousands and thousands of words.\
  \ Of course, the result would say a lot more about me than it would about either\
  \ my father or the late Potus. There would have to be an entire chapter about mashed\
  \ potato. Nixon enjoyed the act of mashing, my father enjoyed eating the results.\
  \ And would I find some mystic significance in the number twelve? These are deep\
  \ waters indeed. What on earth would the twentieth century's most pernicious brain-softener\
  \ have made of them?\n[2010-01-09]"
