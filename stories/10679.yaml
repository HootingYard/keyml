text: "In my debilitated state, felled by germs and much given to whimpering, writing\
  \ one thousandish words upon any subject at all is quite beyond me. On the other\
  \ hand, if readers are to read then writers must write. It occurred to me that I\
  \ might just manage to bash out a few haiku, distillations in a few words of what\
  \ we could call the Hooting Yardanschauung.\nA bog\n  Beyond the viaduct\n  In the\
  \ downpour\nDobson\n  At his escritoire\n  Scribbling twaddle\nA hobgoblin\n  On\
  \ Sawdust Bridge\n  Eating a sausage\nTiny Enid\n  Flooring a ne'er-do-well\n  And\
  \ kicking his head in\nThere are four for you to pore over. There may be more to\
  \ come. Now for the Lemsip!\n[2012-12-13]"
