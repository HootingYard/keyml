text: "Well, this is exciting! Today I received in the post a personal letter from\
  \ \u201Cone of the greatest clairvoyants in France and throughout the world\u201D\
  , David Phild! You know, David Phild, Clairvoyance, Numerology, Astrology, Medium,\
  \ Magical Sciences and Remedial Magnetism! And he has written to me with the thrilling\
  \ news that all good things will come to me in 2012. Just consider this:\nAll January\u2014\
  General improvement\n18 February\u2014Enormous Money Win\nIn March\u2014An encounter\
  \ with love\nAll April\u2014Lucky at gambling\nOne day in May\u2014Huge success\n\
  In June\u2014Luxury travel\nJuly\u2014A loved one returns\n19 August\u2014Big secret\
  \ revealed\nSeptember\u2014Colossal inheritance\nOctober\u2014Good health confirmed\n\
  November\u2014Your luxury home\n24 December\u201412 Sumptuous Gifts\nDavid's letter\
  \ was obviously delayed in the post by those scallywags at the Royal Mail, which\
  \ explains why the predictions for the first quarter of the year didn't come to\
  \ pass. There is a very simple reason, which is, as David says, \u201CImportant!\
  \ You will not succeed without your Celestial Owl. Ask for it immediately.\u201D\
  \ I am going to ask for my owl as soon as I have finished writing this, so at least\
  \ the rest of the year will go according to plan.\nWhat I like about David is that\
  \ he does not raise false hopes. He takes pains to point out that by asking for\
  \ the Owl of Celestial Protection I will not actually receive a real bird in the\
  \ post. No, what I get will be more valuable than that\u2014a medallion!\nThis Magnificent\
  \ Golden Talisman of Great Value has Recognised powers of Protection from evil spells,\
  \ from misfortune and from health problems.\nThe engraving and the consistency of\
  \ your medallion make it one of the most powerful protection domes. It is recognised\
  \ as fabulous by the greatest Grand Sages and Mediums in the World.\nThe catalysis\
  \ of the golden metal and the structure of your skin will generate a variety of\
  \ beneficial waves that will be your rampart against evil. Some vibrations extinguish\
  \ witches\u2019 spells as well as spite and bad rumours and tittle-tattle against\
  \ you.\nThe very composition of the medallion provokes a type of recuperative energy\
  \ that prevents you from wasting money and having to pay out amounts pointlessly\
  \ that gradually plunge you into ruin. Under the protection of the Talisman, you\
  \ will see that a single pound will enable you, under certain conditions, to live\
  \ for as long as if you owned one hundred pounds.\nThe Owl can also reactivate your\
  \ energy and your drive by inundating your cells with a redeeming force of renewal.\
  \ You will be able to feel better, faster, and for longer, without any medical treatment.\n\
  Who wouldn't want an owl like that?\nDavid's letter warns me that \u201Cwhat I am\
  \ doing for you must remain our secret\u201D, so very cleverly, the owl medallion\
  \ is designed to look like a piece of cheap mass-produced tat., which clearly it\
  \ is not. I contacted several Grand Sages, using ethereal powers not dissimilar\
  \ to David's, and they all confirmed that the Owl of Celestial Protection is absolutely\
  \ the bee's knees in the field of talismanic celestial protection through the medium\
  \ of embossed owl on trinket. \u201CThere is no more powerful owl,\u201D said one\
  \ of these Grand Sages, whose name I didn't quite catch, though I understand he\
  \ resides on a mountain peak in a distant eastern realm, obscured by clouds.\nI\
  \ admit to being slightly disappointed that, fantastic as the owl is, David nowhere\
  \ states that it is anything but silent, and emits no hoots. Quite frankly, even\
  \ though my Owl of Celestial Protection is a free gift, I would prefer one that\
  \ hooted. I am sure the construction of a battery-powered hooting medallion cannot\
  \ be beyond David's wit. If he needs financial help for its development and protection,\
  \ he can use the thirty-two pounds I am sending him, as he requests, though nominally\
  \ this sum is to guarantee my receipt of the Sublime and Detailed Revelation of\
  \ the 12 Major Visionary Phases. As far as I can gather the free owl doesn't work\
  \ without the paid-for revelation, or vice versa. Perhaps I need to clear this up\
  \ with the Grand Sages before committing myself.\nPOSTSCRIPT\_: I had the devil\
  \ of a time trying to get in touch with the Grand Sages again, what with the weather\
  \ and the aether and a severe case of the Blavatskys, so in desperation I turned\
  \ to Het Internet. It made for interesting reading, not least in demonstrating just\
  \ how selfless \u201Cdear David\u201D is. While he is offering me a free owl which\
  \ will protect me against \u201Cspite and bad rumours and tittle-tattle\u201D, there\
  \ is little else about him on the interweb except spite and bad rumours and tittle-tattle,\
  \ much of it quite vicious. The man is sorely in need of his own owl, with or without\
  \ battery-driven hooting. Indeed, I am so appalled at the contempt in which he is\
  \ held, I have a good mind, as soon as I receive my owl in the post, to send it\
  \ back to him, that he may be celestially protected from the brickbats of the spiteful\
  \ hordes.\nIn the meantime, I have set to work on the design and production of a\
  \ Hooting Yard Owl Medallion. Clutch it to your bosom, and you will be granted the\
  \ power to scamper up mountainsides and shimmy up flagpoles and disport yourself\
  \ in other high places, there to crow your unstinting devotion to Mr Key from dawn\
  \ till dusk, and from dusk till dawn. Await your personalised letter, offering you\
  \ this fabulous owl entirely free of charge except for the charge that has to be\
  \ levied on the advice of Mr Key's bank manager.\n[2012-04-24]"
