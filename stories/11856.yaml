text: "My recent lassitude\u2014which I think is now behind me\u2014was occasioned\
  \ in part by ResonanceFM's August break. I realise that having to babble into a\
  \ microphone for half an hour every week is an effective spur to composition, and\
  \ without that deadline I can happily gaze out of the window at crows and Not Get\
  \ Anything Done.\n(Oh, by the way, throughout the month ResonanceFM is broadcasting\
  \ old episodes of Hooting Yard daily at 12.30 PM, so that should help to keep you\
  \ lot from chewing your pillows in anguish.)\nAnyway, just as I was sloughing off\
  \ my indolence and clambering back into my toboggan o\u2019 prose, I was further\
  \ inspired by being asked to write a piece for another blog. Meeting someone else's\
  \ deadline always concentrates the mind.\nSo over at BlackberryJuniper & Sherbet\
  \ you can read a brand new piece\u2014written yesterday\u2014together with a little\
  \ introduction explaining why I was asked, and one reader's understanding of the\
  \ Glory That Is Hooting Yard. Off you go!\n[2013-08-17]"
