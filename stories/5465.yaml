text: 'I squelched across the marsh, in driving rain, and linnets sang within my brain.
  There were no linnets to be seen, just crows, drenched crows, drenched crows. I
  lit my pipe and sucked, and heard the caw of a drenched crow. The rain was pelting
  down as I made my slopping way from marsh to town. And in the town, no linnets,
  no, nor crows. Just shuttered kiosks and the stadium. An athlete threw his javelin
  in the air. I watched it soar then stab the sodden grass. I went to the canteen.
  An arty print of crows hung on the wall. I slurped a bowl of steaming warming broth,
  and then I caught a bus back to the marsh.
