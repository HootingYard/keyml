text: "Horst Gack's eerie familiar, a homunculus perched on his shoulder which hissed\
  \ at passers-by and bit those who came too close, has long been a source of fascination\
  \ for a handful of nitwits with nothing better to fill their time. It is now the\
  \ subject of a magisterial new biography, Die Homunculus-vertraut von Gack, the\
  \ result of several hours of slapdash research by Teutonic potboilerist Shaka Kieselkopf,\
  \ a second or possibly third cousin of our own dear Pebblehead.\nFrom the book,\
  \ we learn some startling facts\u2014if, of course, we can read German. If we cannot,\
  \ and absent a translation, we would be better advised to use it as a door-stop,\
  \ or to hold down the corner of a tarpaulin in a gale.\nOne of the less startling\
  \ things we learn is that the familiar was created using the standard Paracelsian\
  \ recipe. Paracelsus (1493\u20131541), real name Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus\
  \ Bombastus von Hohenheim, made the first known homunculus from a bag of bones,\
  \ skin fragments, sperm, and animal hair. He placed these ingredients in the ground,\
  \ surrounded by horse manure, for forty days, after which the embryo sprang into\
  \ being. Horst Gack would appear to have followed this precisely, with the addition\
  \ of some lupins and half a choc-ice.\nInterestingly, we discover that the homunculus\
  \ was absolutely identical to its maker in all respects save its size. It was a\
  \ miniature Horst Gack, down to its stylish Louis Brilliantine suit, trendy winkle-pickers,\
  \ and fantastic bouffant, based, as was Horst Gack's, on The Great Wave at Kanagawa\
  \ by Hokusai. Its temperament, mien, and behaviour were also of a piece with Gack's,\
  \ particularly the hissing and biting.\nThe only thing the homunculus seemed unable\
  \ to do was to conduct huge ensembles in recitals of godawful semi-improvised avant-garde\
  \ racket, though not for want of trying. Kieselkopf tells an enchanting anecdote\
  \ of the homunculus trying to teach various flies, midges, gnats, and bluebottles\
  \ to play the theremin, piccolo, xylophone, and tuba, without success. The sessions\
  \ were recorded, however, and I think the publishers ought to have included a CD\
  \ of the surviving tape. It would have made for a more rounded portrait of Horst\
  \ Gack's familiar.\nOne question which the biography does not address is why the\
  \ homunculus was forever perched on Horst Gack's shoulder. It was a fully functioning\
  \ tiny creature, and could quite easily have scampered off and made its own way\
  \ in the world. Yet it preferred always to remain as if glued to its maker, hissing\
  \ at him and biting him when there was nobody else in the vicinity to torment.\n\
  The missing voice in all this, of course, is that of Horst Gack himself, who apparently\
  \ tried to block the book's publication. The grounds cited in his legal case included\
  \ a claim that the biography \u201Clacked Gack\u201D and was thus \u201Cdippy, ploppy,\
  \ and poopy\u201D. The finest legal minds in Germany are still considering the matter,\
  \ which experts say may not be resolved until some time in the next century. In\
  \ the meantime, an illegal pirated edition of the book is in circulation, and has\
  \ sold upwards of eight copies.\nIt should be noted that I do not read German, and\
  \ there may be wild and unforgivable inaccuracies in the foregoing.\n[2017-01-30]"
