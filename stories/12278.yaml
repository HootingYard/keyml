text: "Yesterday I went to the library, and I emerged into the bright winter sunshine\
  \ clutching four Clarice Lispectors and a Gertrude Himmelfarb. If we consider only\
  \ the writers\u2019 names, it was one of my most spectacularly gratifying borrowings.\
  \ I have not yet begun to read any of the books, but when I do I shall be sure to\
  \ share with you lot anything startling I come across.\nThe reason they must remain\
  \ set aside for the time being is that I am immersed in my current reading. Like\
  \ a mad person, I am deep into Reclaiming History\_: The Assassination Of President\
  \ John F. Kennedy by Vincent Bugliosi. This majestic if preposterous tome weighs\
  \ in at over 1,600 pages and comes freighted with a CD-ROM containing the equivalent\
  \ of a further 1,000 pages of notes. Bugliosi's aim is to prove conclusively that\
  \ Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, and that the multiplicity of conspiracy theories\
  \ are a disservice to history. To achieve this, the magnificently grumpy prosecutor\
  \ hammers away at every last detail of \u201Cwhat did happen\u201D and tears to\
  \ shreds every ditzy bit of fanciful doo-dah of \u201Cwhat did not happen\u201D\
  . In theory, of course, the book, published in 2007 after over twenty years\u2019\
  \ work, would be the final word on the subject. But Bugliosi knows that in spite\
  \ of his mightiest efforts, the nutcases will not be silenced. As he writes (page\
  \ 444):\nunfortunately we know that the notion of a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination\
  \ will be alive and well for centuries to come. I suppose it is a given that there\
  \ will be [others] who will breast-feed the conspiracy loonies for generations to\
  \ come with their special lactations of bilge, blather, and bunk.\nI have been obsessively\
  \ interested in the assassination since, as a ten-year-old, I borrowed from the\
  \ library the JFK issue of a long-forgotten and never-since-seen series of historical\
  \ works for children. These were not books, but pocket files crammed with information\
  \ sheets, facsimiles of historical documents, and\u2014in this case\u2014a cardboard\
  \ cut-out model of Dealey Plaza for assembly by the awestruck tot (me).\nI can only\
  \ conclude, with Thomas Mallon, that I may not be \u201Cof the Grassy Knoll\u201D\
  , but I am most certainly on it.\n\n[2014-01-15]"
