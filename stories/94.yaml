text: "Francis Spufford, in Backroom Boys\_: The Secret Return Of The British Boffin:\n\
  \  I was collecting interviews for a radio documentary, and I had already gathered\
  \ enough of the ethos of the rocketmen to know that Mr [Roy] Dommett was an eccentric\
  \ in some ways. Those who survive from the heyday of British rocketry all live in\
  \ detached, modern houses in Home Counties commuter villages or Midlands suburbs.\
  \ So does Mr Dommett. He, like them, drove home every day from establishments shrouded\
  \ in secrecy to family tea and an after-supper pint in the Green Man. But he inhabits\
  \ a much shaggier version of suburban pastoral than his colleagues. Their houses\
  \ are ultra neat, with outbreaks of supernaturally competent DIY, like externalisations\
  \ of the kind of mind that adjusts a complex system until it's just so. His is surrounded\
  \ by a runaway experiment in growing wildflowers, and has a car in the driveway\
  \ which has been awaiting repairs for many months. Inside, rampaging grandchildren\
  \ zoom about. A keen Morris dancer, with a countryman's voice, he was largely responsible\
  \ for Chevaline, the naval update of Polaris, in the 1970s. As I talked to him,\
  \ he sat by his fire; an old Panama hat wobbled on top of the stack of books next\
  \ to his armchair. It gave him quiet satisfaction that he looked less like Dr Strangelove\
  \ than like Falstaff, or some other figure of innocent pleasure out of deep England.\
  \ Another of the rocketmen I talked to spotted him by chance once in Bristol. \u2018\
  These Morris Men came dancing up the street, led by this big fat bloke in a kind\
  \ of Andy Pandy outfit, who was bopping people on the head with a pig's bladder\
  \ \u2014 and I said to my wife, \u201CSweetheart, you won't believe me, but that\
  \ man is one of the brains behind Britain's nuclear defence.\u201D \u2018\n[2007-03-03]"
