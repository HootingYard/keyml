text: "Pitched past pitch of grief, I wept buckets of tears. Then, on my bakelite\
  \ wireless set, I heard Chrissie Hynde commanding me to stop my sobbing. I usually\
  \ find Ms Hynde persuasive, and in spite of the fact that I felt more pangs, I did\
  \ as she bid. The buckets were both about three-quarters full. I hoisted them, one\
  \ in each hand, and carried them off across the blasted heath. I hoped to get a\
  \ good price for my tears from the tearmonger.\n\u201CWhat have you got for me today?\u201D\
  \ he asked, when I came toiling up to his kiosk. He was a fat slick duplicitous\
  \ argumentative mocking gloomy patched-up greasy dribbling bug-eyed ragged vitamin-deficient\
  \ debauched great bear of a man, all frills and flaps, and I did not warm to him,\
  \ but he was the only working tearmonger in that part of the glade.\n\u201CTwo three-quarter\
  \ buckets of my own grief-stricken tears,\u201D I said, lifting the buckets on to\
  \ his counter. He eyed them coldly.\n\u201CWhat use are they to me?\u201D he snarled,\
  \ \u201CYou are neither an orphan nor a virgin, if memory serves.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Look,\u201D I said, imploring him, \u201CThese tears were wrung wildly from pangs\
  \ of grief. They must be worth something.\u201D\n\u201CI might see my way to giving\
  \ you a soup,\u201D he said.\n\u201CA soup?\u201D I asked, \u201CWhat is that in\
  \ panes, soilings, and pins?\u201D\nI knew very well that a soup was worth only\
  \ a fraction of a pin, but I hoped, hopelessly, to shame the tearmonger into offering\
  \ me a little more. He started faffing about with a sachet of gruesome murder victim's\
  \ widow's tears.\n\u201CSee this?\u201D he said, \u201CTears shed in the actual\
  \ presence of the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopath Babinsky, as he buried\
  \ his axe in the head of the poor woman's husband! Now those are tears that fetch\
  \ a pretty pin,\u201D\n\u201CBut I was pitched past pitch of grief!\u201D I protested.\n\
  He dipped his fingers into one of the buckets, then licked them with his unholy\
  \ tongue, tasting my tears.\n\u201CNot salty enough for true grief,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201CAnd in any case, the buckets are only three-quarters full. In my experience,\
  \ true grief gives vent to unstoppable tears. I think you were just moping.\u201D\
  \nUnder my breath, for the first\u2014and, I hope, last\u2014time in my life, I\
  \ cursed Chrissie Hynde. I knew it would be pointless to appeal to the tearmonger.\
  \ I had him down as a jazz-funk fan. There was little I could do but accept his\
  \ soup. He gave me an eggcupful of minestrone, and I turned away, heading for that\
  \ place in the past we've been cast out of, oh oh oh oh oh oh.\n[2014-12-03]"
