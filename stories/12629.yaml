text: "\nChapter Three of Mr Key's Book Of Birds, a work in progress.\nThe corncrake\
  \ is a type of bird. Its call is raucous and alarming. To gain an idea of how raucous,\
  \ how alarming, imagine you are fast asleep in bed. Because you are obsessed with\
  \ the rigours of polar exploration, you sleep, like Roald Amundsen, with your bedroom\
  \ window wide open in all seasons of the year. Through this open window flies a\
  \ corncrake, and it comes into land upon your head. Ordinarily, the sensation of\
  \ its talons digging into your bouffant to steady its perching would awaken you.\
  \ But you are wearing your thickly-woven woolly swaddling sleep helmet, as recommended\
  \ by Von Straubenzee. Having suffered from debilitating insomnia for many years,\
  \ you studied Von Straubenzee's exciting new discipline of snoozetics. Now, before\
  \ retiring, you drink a pint of lukewarm milk of magnesia, picture yourself tossing\
  \ the contents of your brain into a wooden crate and hammering shut the lid of the\
  \ crate with ten thousand nails, the same number of nails Cornelius Cardew thought\
  \ sufficient to seal the coffin of imperialism, and you don the sleep helmet before\
  \ hopping\u2014never climbing, but hopping\u2014into bed. You have found that ever\
  \ since following Von Straubenzee's procedures religiously, your sleep is deep and\
  \ untroubled and not unlike a coma. Thus when the corncrake alights upon your head,\
  \ and digs its talons into the thick wool of your sleep helmet to steady itself\
  \ in its perching, you do not feel a thing. You remain fast asleep, content and\
  \ snug in la-la land.\nFrom its perch, the corncrake surveys its surroundings. If\
  \ you asked it why it had flown in through the window, and if it was somehow capable\
  \ of responding in an approximation of human speech so that you understood its reply,\
  \ it is likely that the corncrake would have absolutely no idea what impelled it.\
  \ Who knows why birds do what they do? Not even the birds themselves know, for their\
  \ brains are tiny. Rather than using reason, birds follow the dictates of instinct,\
  \ what you or I would call \u201Cgut feelings\u201D. All we are able to say is that,\
  \ on this occasion, the corncrake saw the open window and took the opportunity to\
  \ fly into your bedroom, probably in the hope of finding something to eat. Fortunately,\
  \ densely-woven wool does not feature as part of a corncrake's regular diet.\nSo\
  \ while the bird rests from the exertions of its flight, perched on your head, it\
  \ trains its two black fathomless savage inhuman eyes upon your bedroom. It takes\
  \ in the frieze of martyred saints above the dado rail, the wainscot, the wardrobe,\
  \ the chest of drawers, the rug and the unseemly stains. It takes in the clutter\
  \ atop the bedside cabinet, the glass of water, the folded spectacles, the scrunched\
  \ tissue, the anglepoise lamp, the stray button, the biro, the pins, the bowl, the\
  \ dust, the cardboard carton of pills, the alarm clock, the other button, the little\
  \ jars, the littler bottles, the nameless thingummy, the biscuit crumbs, the snuffbox,\
  \ the coinage, the pipe-cleaners, the mud idol, the cotton wool, the toffee apple\
  \ wrapper, the handkerchief, the string, the puppet, the putty, the duster, the\
  \ rag, the bus ticket, the scrap of paper, the pocket Bible, the rosary beads, the\
  \ taffy tin, the bonbon, the monkey snapshot in its frame, the atomiser, the shopping\
  \ list, the rubber band, the drawing pin, the plaster Madonna and Child statuette,\
  \ the sophisticated cocktail party invitation, the chewing gum, the gloves, the\
  \ telephone. Were it a magpie or a jackdaw, rather than a corncrake, it might swoop\
  \ and snatch up in its beak one of the smaller items on the top of the cabinet and\
  \ fly out through the window and away, to deposit the stolen gewgaw in its nest.\
  \ In folk tales and legends, magpies and jackdaws often appear as thieves, the bird\
  \ equivalents of opportunistic pickpockets, and this characterisation has some basis\
  \ in brute avian fact. Not so the corncrake, which is not thought of as a pillaging\
  \ bird. So while it gazes upon the clutter, it remains still, perched upon your\
  \ sleeping head, and swoops not to snatch booty in its beak.\nStille Nacht. It would\
  \ be hard to imagine a night more still, more silent than this one. The Von Straubenzee\
  \ method ensures you make no stentorian snoring noise. The sound of your breathing\
  \ is almost imperceptible, muffled by the sleep helmet. The corncrake's breathing\
  \ is equally quiet. Nothing stirs in your bedroom, and from outside, through the\
  \ open window, there is not even a breath of wind. It is as if the planet has fallen\
  \ asleep with you.\nI have said that we can have no idea what prompts a bird to\
  \ do what it does. So I can offer no logical, reasoned explanation for the sudden\
  \ loud jarring raucous cry of the corncrake on your head. It makes its harsh caw\
  \ twice, then lifts off, and flies away out of the window. The effect on you is\
  \ instantaneous and awful. You waken, alarmed, indeed panic-stricken, as if prodded\
  \ with a burning hot pointy stick. You do not see the corncrake fly away, so you\
  \ cannot account for the horror by which you are convulsed. Trembling, you clamber\
  \ out of bed and shuffle to your toilet to piddle, a piddle occasioned by fear.\
  \ Such is the raucous and alarming call of the corncrake.\n[2014-04-09]"
