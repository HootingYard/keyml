  And hast thou vim?\nMy gumption is matched only by my vim, O Prince!\nThen thou\
  \ shalt not wilt with weediness when I send thee hence to the huge and terrifying\
  \ fiery Mountains of Awfulness?\nI merely await your word of command, O Prince,\
  \ and I shall be on my way.\nThou hast gumption and vim indeed, tiny one!\nWhat\
  \ is it you would have me do when I reach the Mountains of Awfulness, O mighty one?\n\
  Come close, small heroic person, and I shalt breathe into thine ear what thou must\
  \ do. Psst psst psst psst psst.\nGosh! I understand, O ye who command me to go hence\
  \ to the huge and terrifying fiery Mountains of Awfulness and there to subjugate\
  \ the legions most foul of terrifying fiery Demons that therein do dwell, armed\
  \ as I am with the Pin-cushion of Righteousness.\nThou speakest well, my child.\
  \ Go then hence.\nI shall go. I shall bestride my horse that is known as the Big\
  \ Frightening Horse That Gallops, and you shall watch us vanish in the dust as we\
  \ ride into the sunset, heading for the huge and terrifying fiery Mountains of Awfulness.\n\
  Yea, young tinker, that I shall.\n[Next week\_: More thrills and spills as the Big\
  \ Frightening Horse That Gallops gets lost in a gulch only half way to the huge\
  \ and terrifying fiery Mountains of Awfulness.]\n[2007-03-05]"
