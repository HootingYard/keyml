  \ magazine racks in newsagent's shops contain titles like Nunc Dimitis and Look,\
  \ Cogitate & Learn and The Weekly Cranium, rather than Pap! and Fluffyhead! and\
  \ Tat! It was like that once, in the middle of the last century. And it was in such\
  \ a world that Dobson woke up one morning, went downstairs and ate bloaters for\
  \ breakfast, and polished his Montenegrin hunting boots, and walked out into the\
  \ rain with a surprising sense of purpose. He had had one of his bright ideas, and\
  \ he was going to act on it without delay.\nHe did not pause by the illegal butcher's\
  \ shop, nor by the Tundist Owl Library, nor at the lido nor the pie shop nor the\
  \ allotments, but strode onwards to a pond at the very edge of town where a fledging\
  \ television programme making unit had set up cameras to record a documentary about\
  \ swans. A Quaint, Black And White Look At Some Swans Near A Pond was planned as\
  \ a primetime series for later that year, and would prove to be the most popular\
  \ show of the decade. It was that sort of world.\nElbowing his way through a security\
  \ cordon, Dobson identified the producer, seized him by the collar, and dragged\
  \ him off to one side.\n\u201CI have an idea for a television series,\u201D he shouted\
  \ at the pipe-smoking, cardigan-wearing weakling who crumpled in awe of the out\
  \ of print pamphleteer.\n\u201CI suggest,\u201D continued Dobson, \u201CThat you\
  \ immediately stop filming these confounded swans and instead take up my brilliant\
  \ idea, which is as follows. You gather together roughly a dozen well-known persons,\
  \ all of whom tend to be flibbertigibbets by nature, and you lock them in an attic\
  \ for two months. You then film them, being flibbertigibbets in an attic. The programme\
  \ would be called Celebrity Flibbertigibbet Attic, and I have absolutely no doubt\
  \ that it will be a hit, a palpable hit!\u201D\nThe scrawny television producer\
  \ squirmed free from Dobson's importunate grasp, and thumped back through the mud\
  \ towards where his team was filming over one hundred and twenty hours of swan footage.\
  \ He paused only to re-light his pipe, which had gone out after a fleck of Dobson's\
  \ spittle landed slap in the middle of the bowl.\nAt this point several swans who\
  \ had wandered away from their allotted places set upon Dobson, whooping at him\
  \ and pecking at his trousers, and he fled. On his way home, he stopped in at the\
  \ early morning skiffle club milk bar, and became obsessed with the rhythmic bashing\
  \ of washboards, an interest which utterly consumed him for several weeks, by the\
  \ end of which time he had completely forgotten about his ground-breaking television\
  \ concept. He could be, as I said, a very prescient man, but he was far too easily\
  \ distracted.\nFurther reading\_: inadvisable.\n[2007-03-13]"
