text: "My name is William Tell, and I am an archer of repute. Like Caspar Badrutt,\
  \ the hotelier who pioneered winter sports, I am a man of Switzerland, country of\
  \ chocolate swiss roll and neutrality.\nMy son Walter has a large head, and as he\
  \ lolloped along the mountain paths, it tilted upon his neck and swung from side\
  \ to side. He had become an object of ridicule among the goatherds.\nMy wife, Coco,\
  \ delved into ancient books to see if she could discover a spell to shrink Walter's\
  \ head. I was fully supportive of this strategy, and entered many crossbow tournaments,\
  \ the idea being to win prize monies so Coco could afford to buy more and more ancient\
  \ books.\nThough I won contests in every canton of Switzerland, and even abroad,\
  \ in Italy, where they called me Guglielmo, and our chalet was piled high with ancient\
  \ books, Coco failed to discover an effective spell.\nWalter became low-spirited\
  \ and unusually cantankerous. I feared for my coop of hens, towards which my son\
  \ began to mutter animadversions. He was projecting his inner turmoil against harmless\
  \ poultry, a psychological commonplace. Goatherds are larger, and violent when threatened.\n\
  Desperate, I sought advice from the Swiss Institute Of Deportment. I was told that\
  \ the muscles in Walter's neck could be strengthened rather than his head shrunk.\
  \ The way to do this was to make him carry pieces of fruit balanced atop his crown.\n\
  That goes some way to explaining why Walter had an apple on his head when Hermann\
  \ Gessler, Austrian Vogt of Altdorf, came riding by on his horse. By every Alp in\
  \ Switzerland, how I hated the Vogt!\nI shot the apple off Walter's head with my\
  \ crossbow to show Gessler that I was not a man he should mess with. I had a pomegranate\
  \ in my pocket, and was about to balance it on Gessler's head when I was apprehended\
  \ by his henchmen.\nTo his credit, my quick-thinking son unlatched the hens from\
  \ the coop and set the fear of god into them. He pointed at the henchmen, and yelled\
  \ \u201CKill!\u201D They immediately unhanded me, and fled alongside their Vogt\
  \ of Altdorf.\nInside the chalet, Coco had brewed a potion from a recipe in one\
  \ of the ancient books. Walter took a sip and spat it out, but I drank an entire\
  \ gobletful. Shortly afterwards I lost touch with reality.\nMy name is William Tell,\
  \ and that is my statement. I cannot vouch for its accuracy, as the potion is still\
  \ coursing through my veins. I must now go and tell everything I know about Switzerland\
  \ to a man named Ruskin, who says he is writing a book about this fair country.\n\
