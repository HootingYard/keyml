text: "If you wish to become weak-headed, nervous, and good for nothing, read novels.\
  \ I have seen an account of a young lady, who had become so nervous and excitable,\
  \ in consequence of reading novels, that her head would be turned by the least appearance\
  \ of danger, real or imaginary. As she was riding in a carriage over a bridge, in\
  \ company with her mother and sister, she became frightened at some fancied danger,\
  \ caught hold of the reins, and backed the carriage off the bridge, down a precipice,\
  \ dashing them to pieces.\nAn American Woman, The Ladies\u2019 Vase or, Polite Manual\
  \ For Young Ladies (1849)\n[2011-10-12]"
