text: "Reynolds mentions slop-in-the-pan, but not that almost identical item of Victorian\
  \ cuisine, slops-in-the-pot. Each had its adherents, its devotees. There was a sort\
  \ of tribal loyalty to one dish or the other, so that brawls in taverns or dens\
  \ of vice, or out in the stinking streets, might be occasioned by the \u201Cwrong\u201D\
  \ answer to the challenge \u201Care ye a potman or a panner?\u201D\nVictorian readers\
  \ were so familiar with the rivalry between the two that it drives the plot of many\
  \ novels of the era. In Pallid Ada, The Crippled Heiress, for example, the eponymous\
  \ heroine is torn between her guardian, a slop-in-the-pan man, and her suitor, who\
  \ favours slops-in-the-pot. I haven't actually read the book myself, so I can't\
  \ tell you how things work out. It is just one of a great pile of novels referred\
  \ to in a majestic academic study of fictional slop and slops from the Victorian\
  \ era that I borrowed from the library but had to take back because umpteen other\
  \ borrowers had reserved it. I wish now I had photocopied some of the more startling\
  \ bits.\nOn the face of it, one would think slops-in-the-pot won out over slop-in-the-pan\
  \ every time. After all, with the former you're getting more than one kind of slop\
  \ presented in a presumably ceramic pot, whereas the latter promises just a single\
  \ slop still in the pan in which it was boiled. I suppose what we have here is an\
  \ echo of the eternal battle between Cavaliers and Roundheads, hedonists and puritans.\
  \ The louche and foppish Victorian man-about-town with his decisive cravat and gaudy\
  \ cuffs would plump for multiple slops in a decorative pot, while the severe hawk-faced\
  \ miseryguts groaning under the weight of self-imposed moral strictures would deny\
  \ himself anything but a simple slop in a simple pan.\nIf I still had my library\
  \ book I could copy out its summary of the plot of another novel, or rather part-work,\
  \ A Canker In The Belly Of The Immoral Maniac Husband, or The Ruination Of Captain\
  \ Purvis. In this piece of virtually unreadable tosh, seemingly hundreds of characters,\
  \ whom we have difficulty keeping track of, devour endless pots of slops and pans\
  \ of slop, chapter after chapter, in between taking part in scenes of unimaginable\
  \ vice and degradation, not the least of which is the tying of a tin can to the\
  \ tail of an orphaned puppy. They don't write 'em like that anymore, for which perhaps\
  \ we should be thankful.\nNOTE\_: Reynolds refers to sop-in-the-pan, not slop-in-the-pan.\
  \ My mistaken recollection, twenty-four hours after typing up the original quotation,\
  \ clearly makes a nonsense of this entire piece. But I refuse to apologise. My short-term\
  \ memory may be in as ruinous a state as Captain Purvis's domestic hearth, but I\
  \ shall carry on regardless, contemptuous of brickbats, and I have no doubt that\
  \ I shall prevail, in the end, whenever an end may come.\n[2009-07-03]"
