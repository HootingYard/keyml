text: "Here at Hooting Yard we will be providing complete coverage of the Euro 2012\
  \ foopball tournament. What this consists of, for the uninitiated, is a few weeks\
  \ during which men in shorts run around grassy fields, huffing and puffing and occasionally\
  \ falling over. The focus of their attention is a ball\u2014the foopball\u2014which\
  \ is about the size of a pig's head. There are various arcane rules governing their\
  \ chasing around of the ball, but you do not really need to know them to enjoy the\
  \ spectacle.\nThe grassy field is known as a pitch. It has several lines drawn on\
  \ it with whitewash. These are applied by a chap known as the groundsman, but he\
  \ is nowhere to be seen while the men are running around. At least, he is not readily\
  \ identifiable. He may well be among the teeming thousands of spectators, but then\
  \ again he is just as likely to be sat in his potting shed puffing on a rollup and\
  \ smearing grease on to his whitewash-applicator, readying it for the next application\
  \ of whitewash to the grass. He is, in a sense, the unsung hero of the tournament,\
  \ for without his whitewash application skills, without the markings on the grass,\
  \ the men running around in pursuit of the foopball would run around in a completely\
  \ haphazard fashion. Some of them are already haphazard enough, but at least with\
  \ the whitewashed lines they are given some idea of where they are.\nIn the potting\
  \ shed, while smoking a gasper and greasing his whitewashing contraption, the groundsman\
  \ will probably be listening to a transistor radio. He will have it tuned in to\
  \ a station broadcasting what is called a \u201Ccommentary\u201D on the foopball\
  \ match. This is where a man among the teeming thousands of spectators, in a special\
  \ box, and armed with a microphone, babbles his observations of what is happening\
  \ on the pitch. He will say things like: \u201CHere we are in the field of dreams,\
  \ surrounded by fields of cows\u201D and \u201CFor a moment there, he looked like\
  \ a baby gazelle who'd just plopped out of the womb\u201D. Such aper\xE7us can actually\
  \ be more entertaining than the foopball game itself, long stretches of which are\
  \ often pointless and enervating.\nIf you find your mind wandering and do not have\
  \ a transistor radio, you can pass the time by counting the persons on the pitch.\
  \ Generally speaking, there ought to be twenty-one people running around, two standing\
  \ at either end looking a bit disconsolate, and a further two running up and down\
  \ the whitewashed lines on either side. Those latter two have whistles and flags.\
  \ One of the men on the pitch also has a whistle, but no flag. Instead, he carries\
  \ a couple of cards in his breast pocket. Every now and again he will take one of\
  \ the cards and brandish it in the air, as if it were some kind of talisman of great\
  \ import. He will always blow his whistle shortly beforehand. In addition to these\u2026\
  \ er, let me add the numbers quickly\u2026 these twenty-five persons, there is a\
  \ twenty-sixth, a shadowy figure rarely if ever seen, known as \u201Cthe fourth\
  \ official\u201D. You don't need to worry your little pointy head about him.\nAnother\
  \ thing you can do to pass the time is to keep a beady eye on the men in shorts\
  \ who are nowhere near the foopball. They will occupy themselves in various ways,\
  \ chief among them being standing with their hands on their hips, kneeling to retie\
  \ their bootlaces, spitting, and darting about in brief little runs in every direction\
  \ to no apparent purpose. Sometimes they might punch each other.\nIf, like Charles\
  \ Babbage, you are neurasthenically sensitive to noise, you should be warned that\
  \ the \u201Csoundtrack\u201D to a foopball match, apart from dirge-like singing\
  \ from the teeming thousands of spectators, is the blaring of hooters and klaxons.\
  \ This blaring appears to be entirely gratuitous, a din for din's sake. In olden\
  \ times, before the hooter, spectators liked to hold aloft wooden rattles. They\
  \ made less of a din, and were only ever seen or heard at foopball matches, unlike\
  \ the hooter and klaxon which can be deployed in various other contexts. Nobody\
  \ is quite sure what became of the common wooden rattle, not even the groundsman,\
  \ who in his time probably collected a fair number of discarded ones from the grounds.\
  \ One assumes they must have been discarded, otherwise they would still be being\
  \ rattled, by spectators, in place of the hooting of hooters and the blaring of\
  \ klaxons.\nCertain more unruly spectators like to set off burning flares, as if\
  \ they were lost at sea. You cannot play foopball in the sea. The nearest thing\
  \ to it is water polo, and even this is more likely to be played in indoor pools\
  \ rather than in the vast and pitiless ocean. But whitewash cannot be applied, in\
  \ straight lines, to water, whether fresh or salt, pool or sea, so there is no role\
  \ for the groundsman. That is why you will not find him listening, in his potting\
  \ shed, on his transistor radio, to the commentaries babbled by spectators in special\
  \ boxes with microphones at water polo matches. He has no personal investment in\
  \ water polo, whereas with foopball he knows that in every moment of the game his\
  \ whitewashed lines have significance. His work has heft.\nThroughout the Euro 2012\
  \ tournament you would be advised to keep a tally of the results. I realise I have\
  \ not explained the scoring system, but that is something else you need not fret\
  \ about, as there are big scoreboards next to the pitches which display numbers\
  \ on them. At the end of each match you can copy the numbers into your Hooting Yard\
  \ Euro 2012 Foopball Tournament Tally Ledger, With Stickers. Details of how to obtain\
  \ this treasured souvenir will be revealed in the coming days.\n[2012-06-08]"
