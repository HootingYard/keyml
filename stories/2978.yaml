  I particularly enjoyed Dying Speeches Execution Broadsides, which contains much
  that is gruesome, in a chronologically distant, non-threatening way. Oddly, no mention
  is made of the killer Babinsky, whose gore-splattered end would make some of the
  scenes depicted look more like the twee adventures of Pippy The Pit Pony. I shall
  transcribe an account of Babinsky''s doom here shortly, when I can face typing up
  the details without emptying my guts all over the place.
