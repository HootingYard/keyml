text: "What with the foul and beastly vice and further spookiness at South Mimms,\
  \ I admit to lying awake at night, tossing and turning, fretful that nothing of\
  \ comparable import ever seemed to happen at North Mimms. One likes to think of\
  \ the Mimms (Mimmses?) as equal in their attractions, albeit those attractions are\
  \ largely historical. Balanced Mimms are so much easier to comprehend, within my\
  \ head, than lopsided Mimms. I am going to have to consult a reference work to decide\
  \ on the proper plural.\nTo my delight, I have discovered an event at North Mimms\
  \ to serve as a counterweight to all that shenanigans at South Mimms. The Age Of\
  \ Wonder\_: How The Romantic Generation Discovered The Beauty And Terror Of Science\
  \ by Richard Holmes is itself a wonder of a book. Nige has a postage on it which\
  \ you would do well to read. In his chapter on ballooning, Holmes tells us of the\
  \ foppish Vincent Lunardi (1759\u20131806), a young Italian who made the first manned\
  \ balloon ascent in Britain, rising from Moorfields in London on 15 September 1784.\
  \ He took his cat with him. After drifting across London and over Hertfordshire,\
  \ eating chicken, drinking champagne, and accidentally breaking one of his aerial\
  \ oars, Lunardi noticed that the cat was numb with cold. He brought the balloon\
  \ down (by paddling the oars, he claimed, which Holmes points out is impossible),\
  \ and delivered the shivering cat into the hands of a no doubt nonplussed peasant\
  \ girl in a field, before reascending and continuing his historic flight. And where\
  \ was this field? Why, in North Mimms!\nI have not yet managed to ascertain the\
  \ name of the cat, more's the pity. If any reader knows it, perhaps they would be\
  \ kind enough to let me know in the Comments. You can see the cat for yourself in\
  \ this portrait of Lunardi published by Edward Hodges of Cornhill just six weeks\
  \ after his act of feline mercy in North Mimms.\n\n[2011-04-17]"
