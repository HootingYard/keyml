text: "As Hooting Yard is the home of The Grunty Man, I thought I should draw to your\
  \ attention the latest \u201CAncient and Modern\u201D column by Peter Jones in The\
  \ Spectator:\nWhat a pleasure it was to watch the men's final at Wimbledon contested\
  \ with a minimum of grunting, exclaiming and gesticulation. Romans would have approved.\n\
  It was well known that athletes and those taking exercise had a tendency to grunt.\
  \ Seneca the Younger (c. 4 bc\u2013ad 65), multi-millionaire Stoic philosopher and\
  \ adviser to Nero, described his unfortunate lodgings over the baths, which made\
  \ him abhor his ears: quite apart from people hawking their wares, depilators making\
  \ their victims shriek, bathers singing out loud and splashing about, \u2018those\
  \ working out with weights \u2014 whether actually working out or just faking it\
  \ \u2014 grunt away; when they let out their breath, they emit shrill wheezes\u2019\
  . The satirist Juvenal mocks the way female gladiators, taught by their trainers\
  \ to prepare for the real thing, \u2018grunt while they practise thrusts at a tree-stump\
  \ (and then reach for the potty)\u2019.The assumption is that the grunting associated\
  \ with exercise was largely a matter of showing-off: it sent out the message \u2018\
  look what a heroic effort we are putting into all this\u2019. In a philosophical\
  \ dialogue, Cicero shines a different light on the matter. Discussing mastery of\
  \ pain, he sees an analogy between bracing the soul in order to keep a stiff upper\
  \ lip and bracing the body to sustain a supreme physical effort. In both cases,\
  \ a groan or grunt may help. He cites athletes in training, especially \u2018boxers\
  \ who, unleashing a blow on their opponent, emit a grunt\u2026 in order to tense\
  \ up the body and so increase the force of the hit\u2019. To that extent, Cicero\
  \ goes on, a man in pain may release a groan \u2014 but nothing feeble or piteous\
  \ \u2014 if by bringing a degree of relief it will strengthen his will for the battle\
  \ against it.\nThe two Wimbledon finalists provided an admirable example of skill,\
  \ determination, self-control and minimal, functional grunting. Perhaps the professional\
  \ grunters and ranters might mend their ways if crowds grunted and ranted back at\
  \ them in mocking unison.\nI feel inspired by this to write a fat and comprehensive\
  \ World History Of Grunts And Grunting. Watch this space.\n[2015-07-22]"
