  I hesitate to provide this link to my cupboard in The Dabbler on this fine Friday,
  for this week I have chosen to besmirch the pages of that splendid blog with a stream
  of pure unbridled filth. Those of you who, in spite of that warning, proceed to
  wallow in a swamp of moral turpitude may be amused to discover that, in the Comments,
  a fellow named George has devised a diverting parlour game which will provide much
  fun and frolic to those who commandeer their parlours for the playing of games.
