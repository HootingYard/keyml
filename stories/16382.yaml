text: "I ordered my horse to be brought from the stables. His name is Alan. He is\
  \ an elegant horse, but tubercular. His shanks are admirable, and he has as fine\
  \ a mane as any horse in Christendom.\nThe stable-boy, a pockmarked little squirt\
  \ who bore a distinct resemblance to the young Stalin, came limping out. His face\
  \ was drained of all colour.\n\u201CAlan is gone, gone, vanished, as if in a puff\
  \ of smoke!\u201D he cried, and began to weep.\nI cannot bear the sight of a weeping\
  \ stable-boy.\n\u201CI cannot bear the sight of a weeping stable-boy!\u201D I cried,\
  \ \u201CStop snivelling!\u201D\nAnd I jabbed a finger sharply into one of his pocks.\
  \ I found this immensely satisfying, so I jabbed my other seven fingers, one by\
  \ one, into seven of his other pocks.\n\u201CNow,\u201D I said, \u201CYou will go\
  \ and find Alan. The mobile library is parked outside the birdseed shop on Lower\
  \ Goat Lane. In the library, you will find a horse-atlas. Borrow it, using your\
  \ library ticket. The horse-atlas contains many maps showing those parts where horses\
  \ of different complexions and beauty are located. It is likely Alan has galloped\
  \ to one such part of our land. Work out which, using the horse-knowledge you have\
  \ acquired as a stable-boy, get thee hence, and fetch him back, using a lasso if\
  \ need be.\u201D\nI was pleased with this little speech, almost as pleased as I\
  \ was jabbing my fingers into his pocks, so I took myself off to the tavern for\
  \ well-deserved refreshment. When I arrived at the tavern, on Upper Goat Lane, I\
  \ discovered that it was under new management and had been turned into a trendy\
  \ milk bar, within which dozens of beatniks were playing bongos and reciting terrible\
  \ poetry.\nAs I sipped my tumbler of milk, I jotted down the words of one of the\
  \ poems I heard.\nI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving\
  \ hysterical naked,\nBecause their horses had gone missing from the stables\nBut\
  \ they were in luck because they could send pockmarked stable-boys who looked like\
  \ the young Stalin\nOff in search of their horses armed with a horse-atlas from\
  \ the mobile library.\nFor some reason, I found that this poem spoke to me in a\
  \ way the other beatnik twaddle did not. Perhaps it was because I was one of the\
  \ best minds of my generation. I had a trophy to prove it, a cup I had been given\
  \ in my infant school. The full wording etched on the cup was another poem:\nBest\
  \ mind your cup, oh child so tiny\nIf you break it you will be whiney\nAnd if you\
  \ whine on Saint Spivack's Day\nThe Grunty Man will take you away!\nI had actually\
  \ been taken away by the fearsome and awful Grunty Man at the age of six, but he\
  \ grew so exasperated by my constant whining that he brought me back again later\
  \ the same day. As I sat in the groovy milk bar, I could only hope that the stable-boy\
  \ would bring Alan the horse back just as quickly.\nHe duly turned up several hours\
  \ later, by which time I had drunk so much milk, and listened to so much terrible\
  \ poetry accompanied by bongos, that I was burning for the ancient heavenly connection\
  \ to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed\
  \ and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating\
  \ across the tops of cities contemplating jazz.\nThe stable-boy had brought me a\
  \ horse, but it was not Alan. It was neither elegant nor tubercular, its shanks\
  \ were despicable, and its mane was nothing to write home about.\n\u201CThat horse\
  \ is not Alan!\u201D I cried, \u201CIt is neither elegant nor tubercular, its shanks\
  \ are despicable, and its mane is nothing to write home about!\u201D\n\u201CSorry,\u201D\
  \ said the stable-boy, \u201CI visited many many many of the places on the maps\
  \ in the horse-atlas, and this is the best I could do.\u201D\nI was minded to jab\
  \ my fingers in his pocks again, but I restrained myself.\n\u201CTake the new horse\
  \ to the stables and saddle it up,\u201D I said, \u201CI will be along shortly,\
  \ for I have miles to go before I vomit up all this milk and go to sleep.\u201D\n\
  The stable-boy plodded off with the horse in tow, and I drank another tumbler of\
  \ milk and listened to another godawful poem accompanied by bongos.\nWhen I made\
  \ to leave, I found my way barred by a huge bouncer-beatnik.\n\u201CWhat gives,\
  \ daddy-o?\u201D he said, \u201CYou don't want to leave this groovy milk bar. Anyway,\
  \ we won't let you. You're the kind of cat we'd love to have hitting those bongos\
  \ morning noon and night. You really fry my wig. Yes, you'll stay here forever,\
  \ drinking milk and thumping bongos. Where would you go, anyway?\u201D\nI whined.\n\
  \u201COut of here\u2014that's my goal.\u201D\nThe first sentence, and the last,\
  \ were translated from the German by Tania and James Stern. Everything in between\
  \ was not.\n[2018-03-20]"
