text: "Readers with school community education hub-aged tinies will be keen to find\
  \ activities to entertain and instruct their nippers through the summer holidays.\
  \ Surprisingly few children today take as great delight as Little Ruskin did in\
  \ jumping off a box, so that splendid hobby is unlikely to occupy all their time\
  \ in the coming weeks. Thus I am pleased to announce Mr Key's Summer Holiday Cartographic\
  \ Excitement Project.\nThe idea is that, when the weather is foul or the bliss of\
  \ frolicking outdoors begins to pall, your tinies can busy themselves drawing maps\
  \ of Hooting Yard. First of all, of course, they will have to be familiar with all\
  \ the tales and investigations posted here, so I suggest you make them click on\
  \ the \u201CProse\u201D category (in the Archives) and read everything, possibly\
  \ twice. Then give them paper and pencils and crayons and pots of paint and so on,\
  \ and have them create a map, or maps, which accurately, or indeed inaccurately,\
  \ represent the settings of the stuff they have read. They may wish to draw a detailed\
  \ street map of Pointy Town, or the branch line out to O'Houlihan's Wharf, or even\
  \ something as ambitious as the entire landscape, showing Sawdust Bridge and Bodger's\
  \ Spinney and Pebblehead's \u201Cchalet o\u2019 prose\u201D and Scroonhoonpooge\
  \ Farmyard and the running track where fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol sprinted round\
  \ and round and round under the watchful eye of Old Halob and the dingly dell hotel\
  \ carpark and the bottomless viper pit and so on and so, exhaustively, forth.\n\
  That should keep them busy until summer's end, at which point they, or you, can\
  \ scan their maps and send them to Mr Key, who will display each and every one received\
  \ here on the Hooting Yard website.\n[2010-07-27]"
