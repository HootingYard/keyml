text: "Fair stood the wind for France\nThe land in which I'll prance\nAlong the boulevards\
  \ and rues\nIn my winklepicker shoes\nThen to Switzerland I'll proceed\nTo the Alps!\
  \ Fear not, I'll heed\nWarnings about the high thin air\nWhich warn my brain may\
  \ need repair\nBut that thin air is just the thing\nFor those of us who're suffering\n\
  Who suffer as I do from TB\nLying shattered on a balcony\nHigh in the Alps\u2019\
  \ imperious span\nLike a character from Thomas Mann\n[2011-04-30]"
