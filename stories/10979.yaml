  \ thanks to Salim Fadhley, we learn of his diametrically opposite view of soup.\
  \ Mr Fadhley pointed me to this passage from President Nixon\_: Alone In The White\
  \ House by Richard Reeves (2001):\n\n. . .on March 24 [1969], the President hosted\
  \ his first state dinner, for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada. He complained\
  \ to Haldeman about it the next morning\_: \u201CWe've got to speed up these dinners.\
  \ They take forever. So why don't we just leave out the soup course?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Well. . .\u201D Haldeman began.\nNixon cut him off\_: \u201CMen don't really like\
  \ soup.\u201D\nOn a hunch, the chief of staff called the President's valet, Manolo\
  \ Sanchez, and asked\_: \u201CWas there anything wrong with the President's suit\
  \ after that dinner last night?\u201D\n\u201CYes. He spilled soup down the vest.\u201D\
  \nThe action memo went out\_: No more soup, ever.\n[2013-02-05]"
