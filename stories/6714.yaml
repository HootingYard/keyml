text: "\nOver at The Dabbler this week, a note on bags, on holes in bags, on monks\
  \ and moths, on palaces of the Tsar, on corridors in those palaces, on Yoko Ono.\
  \ Is it, then, a set of notes rather than a single note? Perhaps so, and I should\
  \ be more precise in my title. \u201CA Note On Bags\u201D should be about bags,\
  \ and nothing but bags. But of course there are all sorts of bags, from the pippy\
  \ to the tea, so I would need to spell out precisely what bags my note was about,\
  \ if it were about nothing but bags, and had nothing to add on holes and monks and\
  \ moths and palaces and Tsars and corridors and Yoko Ono, but it concerns itself\
  \ with all those things, so the title as given is a misnomer. \u201CAn Imprecisely-Named\
  \ Note On Bags\u201D might do the trick, or \u201CA Set Of Notes On Bags And Other\
  \ Things\u201D. What a palaver.\n[2011-06-17]"
