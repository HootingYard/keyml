text: "The peculiar forces of devastation induced by modern city life have only entered\
  \ the world lately; and no existing terms of language known to me are enough to\
  \ describe the forms of filth, and modes of ruin, that varied themselves along the\
  \ course of Croxsted Lane. The fields on each side of it are now mostly dug up for\
  \ building, or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground by the wild\
  \ crossings and concurrencies of three railroads. Half a dozen handfuls of new cottages,\
  \ with Doric doors, are dropped about here and there among the gashed ground: the\
  \ lane itself, now entirely grassless, is a deep-rutted, heavy-hillocked cart-road,\
  \ diverging gatelessly into various brick-fields or pieces of \_waste; and bordered\
  \ on each side by heaps of\u2014Hades only knows what!\u2014mixed dust of every\
  \ unclean thing that can crumble in drought, and mildew of every unclean thing that\
  \ can rot or rust in damp: ashes and rags, beer-bottles and old shoes, battered\
  \ pans, smashed crockery, shreds of nameless clothes, door-sweepings, floor-sweepings,\
  \ kitchen garbage, back-garden sewage, old iron, rotten timber jagged with out-torn\
  \ nails, cigar-ends, pipe-bowls, cinders, bones, and ordure, indescribable; and,\
  \ variously kneaded into, sticking to, or fluttering foully here and there over\
  \ all these,\u2014remnants broadcast, of every manner of newspaper, advertisement\
  \ or big-lettered bill, festering and flaunting out their last publicity in the\
  \ pits of stinking dust and mortal slime.\nJohn Ruskin, from Fiction\_: Fair And\
  \ Foul, 1880\n\_\n[2008-10-18]"
