text: 'While I languish in my sickbed glugging Lemsip and generally feeling woebegone,
  there are a couple of items I ought to bring to your attention.

  The first (courtesy of Jonathan Calder) is this startling headline from Kent Online.
  I suspect this is one of those occasions when real life collides with a paperback
  potboiler by Pebblehead.

  The second is to inform you of a couple of books the existence of which I have recently
  learned. Recently and belatedly, given that both were published almost three hundred
  years ago. I am going to have to learn Dutch in order to read them:

  Jacobus Hondius, Black Register Of A Thousand Sins (1724)

  Anon,, The Finger Of God, or Holland And Zeeland In Great Need From This Hitherto
  Unheard Plague Of Worms (1731?)

  I ought to illustrate this postage with images of badgers and worms and sin, but
  instead I am going to fall into an uneasy and fevered sleep.
