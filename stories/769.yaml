text: "Mick Wiggins has sent in a splendidly informative report about those pudding\
  \ fenders. Many thanks to him for this:\nI will relate what little I know about\
  \ these bulbous knotted affairs that deck hands would hang from the deck and bow\
  \ in order to prevent damage to the hull from knocking about while the ship is at\
  \ berth.\_While commonly used up until the early 20th century, the hand-made rope\
  \ bumpers were eventually replaced with used auto tires and synthetic rubbers.\_\
  \nVisually, they're masterpieces of knot-craft, heavy and beautifully patterned.\xC2\
  \_Lord knows how long it took to knit these things, but I hear sailors can have\
  \ a lot of free time on their hands while at sea. I did come across a site that\
  \ sells modern versions of Pudding Fenders, but\xC2\_I can't really think why one\
  \ would buy one except for the reason of being able to shout \u201CThrow down the\
  \ Pudding Fenders\u201D to the first mate every so often.\nAlso known as Bow Pudding,\
  \ they came in all kinds of different shapes, sausage-like mostly, and even one\
  \ style that looks like a steroidal string mop hung from the bow like a great messy\
  \ beard. \_. \_\nHere's a nice example, just like one of the fenders I saw on display\u2014\
  large and huggable even, it measured a meter+ in diameter.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\nOn\
  \ a side note, I was a little, well, a lot confused about the Pudding aspect, until\
  \ tonight I remembered something about the English and their puddings.\n\n\_\n\_\
  \n\_\n\_\nMystery solved! I think this Hack Pudding would serve very nicely as a\
  \ fender.\nAs for Dismal Nitch, I did not make it down there, as it was raining\
  \ and dismal out. I learned though,\xC2\_it was during a particularly fierce winter\
  \ storm\xC2\_in the early 1800's\xC2\_that had the famous explorers Lewis and Clark\
  \ pinned down for days, that this spit of land near the mouth of the Columbia River\
  \ earned its name, which is still in use by locals.\n[2008-10-16]"
