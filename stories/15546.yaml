text: "\nNever has an infant been so pious as little Henry Clump, the pious infant\
  \ whose life is told in The Pious Infant by Mrs Regera Dowdy\u2014or so I thought.\
  \ But when I was enmired in the research for Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief\
  \ Lives, I learned of Saint Rumwold, by comparison with whom Henry Clump seems the\
  \ spawn of Satan.\nSaint Rumwold was born in King's Sutton in 622 AD, the son of\
  \ Saint Cyneburga and King Alchfrid. His first words\u2014uttered on the day of\
  \ his birth\u2014were \u201CI am a Christian\u201D. He then asked to be baptised,\
  \ and to receive Holy Communion. The next day he preached a sermon, quoting freely\
  \ from the Bible. On the third day, he gave another sermon, addressed to his parents,\
  \ after which he keeled over and died. We can be sure he ascended into Heaven.\n\
