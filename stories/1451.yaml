  Here is a photograph of Mr Key''s mud idol. As is de rigueur with mud idols, nails
  have been driven into it. In this case, each nail represents the immortal soul of
  a badger, or of an otter. During secret ceremonies, Mr Key prostrates himself on
  his stomach before the mud idol and, in guttural ululations, beseeches it to pulverise
  his foes using the maleficent Gaar, or energy, of the badgers and otters impacted
  within its mudness.
