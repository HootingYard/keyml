text: "Dobson's pamphlet Things Beginning With B (out of print) is chiefly remarkable\
  \ for the paucity of things beginning with B to which it attends. After a few ill-tempered\
  \ prefatory remarks in which the twentieth century's titanic pamphleteer gets off\
  \ his chest certain moans and grumbles about rain and mud and swans, he embarks\
  \ upon a surprisingly knowledgeable account of bees. This display of unlikely learning\
  \ puzzled Dobsonists for many a year, until Aloysius Nestingbird discovered that\
  \ the passage is copied out in its entirety from a Victorian work of natural history\
  \ entitled Everything A Sickly Victorian Infant Needs To Know About Bees, Wasps\
  \ And Hornets by Mrs Lachrima Baste.\nDobson next announces that he is going to\
  \ give the most thorough account of breakfast ever attempted in English prose. He\
  \ does not. Following a short paragraph about eggs, containing nothing that the\
  \ average hen coop observer would not learn in a morning, the pamphleteer asserts\
  \ that the \u201Cbreakfast of the future\u201D will be smokers\u2019 poptarts, a\
  \ product at that time newly introduced to the ever-burgeoning breakfast food market.\
  \ While admitting that he has yet to try this toothsome savoury himself, Dobson\
  \ sings the praises of the smokers\u2019 poptart to so ludicrous an extent that\
  \ one suspects he was in the pay of the manufacturers. As indeed he was. It was\
  \ Nestingbird, again, who winkled out the embarrassing truth. Facing a large gas\
  \ bill and a fine imposed upon him for an offence described as \u201Cthrowing pebbles,\
  \ with menace, at swans\u201D, Dobson was more than usually desperate for cash,\
  \ and it seems that when a representative from the smokers\u2019 poptarts manufacturers\u2019\
  \ association came a\u2013calling, the pamphleteer struck a shabby deal. As hairy\
  \ persons in the 1960s might have put it, he \u201Csold out to The Man, man\u201D\
  .\nThus it is that the bulk of Things Beginning With B is nothing more than an extended\
  \ paean to smokers\u2019 poptarts, for having exhausted his flights of wittering\
  \ guff about the breakfast product, Dobson brings the pamphlet to an abrupt close\
  \ with the preposterous claim that, bees and breakfast aside, there is nothing much\
  \ of any interest that begins with the letter B.\nIt is not known how much money\
  \ Dobson received for his poptart puffery. The records show that, although the swans-and-pebbles-related\
  \ fine was paid in full, his gas supply was cut off on St Creak's Day of that year,\
  \ and not reinstated until the first day of Vice President Nixon's visit to Venezuela,\
  \ as recounted in Six Crises (1962).\n[2011-03-17]"
