  \ and you will see it too.\n  We should airlift it to the puffin hospital yonder\
  \ in our chopper.\n  Take those corks out of your ears so you can hear me speak.\n\
  \  Love is a mighty power, and I love puffins, as I love guillemots and auks and\
  \ bonxies.\n  Snap those icicles dangling from your nose and you will breathe easier.\n\
  \  Here comes a blizzard. Oh, puffin, don't die.\n  Stamp your feet in your furry\
  \ boots, my companion.\n  Two men and a collapsed puffin in a white wasteland.\n\
  \  Allegory of something or other.\n  The chopper blades are frozen, and we are\
  \ stranded, or marooned.\n  Come, Squiffy, plod with me towards the puffin, that\
  \ we may give it succour.\n  Love conquers all, if you will wipe those damned goggles!\n\
