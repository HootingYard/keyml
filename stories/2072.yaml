text: "Bela Tarr's S\xE1t\xE1ntang\xF3 sounds like my kind of film. Indeed, I'm astonished\
  \ that it has only just come to my attention, given that it was released in 1994.\
  \ Clearly I am not keeping up with things as energetically as I ought to be. S\xE1\
  t\xE1ntang\xF3 is seven and a half hours long, in black and white, set on a collapsing\
  \ collective farm in Hungary, and the opening shot, which lasts for almost eight\
  \ minutes, follows a herd of Hungarian cows trudging around a collapsing collective\
  \ farmyard. I have not yet seen it, but I suspect I will adore it.\n[2009-03-17]"
