  \ subjected abductees to breeding experiments in parked spaceships or secret underground\
  \ laboratories, have already produced a race of hybrids who will someday rule or\
  \ even replace us. The hybrids may in fact be shopping and commuting all around\
  \ us as I write. And even if they aren't, their mixed parentage could help to explain\
  \ the familiar images found in abduction memories like the following\u2026\n\u201C\
  He's got on a, a multistriped t-shirt\u2026 And some, like, little blue shorts\u2026\
  \_ They had sophisticated-looking toys\u2026 They have a yo-yo\u2026 It looks like\
  \ an Etch-a-Sketch screen, except it's filled with all sorts of stuff.\n\u201CThey\
  \ were dressed like 1920s thugs, and came into the bedroom with old-fashioned Tommy\
  \ Guns, aiming at me and blazing away.\n\u201CBeth Collings saw a naked man in an\
  \ enormous white cowboy hat.\n\u201CKarla Turner\u2026 mentions two people she knows\
  \ who have seen aliens disguised as hillbillies. Katharina Wilson had an experience\
  \ with an alien masquerading as Al Gore.\n\u201COnce recollections of this kind\
  \ are taken to be authentic, guesswork as to the aliens\u2019 true nature and purpose\
  \ becomes irresistible. What if, for example, Katharina Wilson's visitor wasn't\
  \ just masquerading as Al Gore but was Al Gore\u2014the hybrid or body snatcher\
  \ who has already replaced the man from Tennessee? And if so, the alien takeover\
  \ of our executive branch surely wouldn't have stopped at the second in command.\
  \ Consider this provocative observation by the renowned abduction expert David M\
  \ Jacobs:\n\u201CBecause the late-state hybrids are mainly human, they have strong\
  \ sexual drives but little conscience. It is as if they have human attributes but\
  \ lack human controls. Even if they do have a conscience, they know that the human\
  \ victim will immediately forget what happened to her. The hybrid might assume there\
  \ is no lasting effect upon the human and he can therefore do and say anything he\
  \ pleases with impunity.\n\u201CCould the space creature who assumed the form of\
  \ Bill Clinton have been hideously mocking us when it kept invoking \u2018executive\
  \ privilege\u2019?\u201D\nFrederick Crews, \u201CThe Mind Snatchers\u201D (1998)\
