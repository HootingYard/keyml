text: 'There is something very odd going on in the orchard. At night, after sunset,
  there is a curious hubbub. It is the sound of talking fruit. Hanging from their
  branches, the orchard fruits chatter away in the darkness. Each has a characteristic
  tone. The apples are shrill, the pears engage in tirades, the persimmons mutter.
  All the fruits talk constantly and simultaneously, so it is extremely difficult
  to decipher a word any of them is saying, even if we understood their languages.

  Are any of them listening to each other, or are they just babbling, incoherently,
  oblivious to their fellow fruits? Why do they wait to speak until nightfall? Why
  are the fallen fruits silent? Why does nobody come to gather the fallen fruits from
  the orchard floor? Why are they left to rot?

  It is the most curious of orchards, over there beyond the railway track and the
  viaduct, surrounded by thick thorny hedges in which no bird will nest.
