text: "\u201CIt is the sublime inconsequence of a farm that I like, the confusion\
  \ of noises, the sense of unreality that is given as a great and heavenly gift to\
  \ human beings who live among thudding, moaning cattle, and tumbling milk-cans,\
  \ and hens screeching underfoot and who, no matter how they try, can never coerce\
  \ their lives into routine, but must always wait on the weather and market prices\
  \ and the temperamental vagaries of their stock, and at one time spend idle weeks\
  \ in the rain, and at another toil both day and night, and at yet another time waste\
  \ precious hours chasing a cow which has got into the wrong field and which, in\
  \ running away, impales itself eventually on the railings, or in segregating cock\
  \ chickens of three weeks old who suddenly discover their sex and in one afternoon\
  \ reduce each other to bleeding wisps of tow. That is what I like about a farm.\u201D\
