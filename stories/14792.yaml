text: "Last week I went for my first appointment at the Tuesday Injection Clinic (which\
  \ I think of as the Tuesday Injection Club). I learned a number of things. One,\
  \ that I would be attending every fortnight, rather than every month, until at least\
  \ the end of the year. Two, that the entire procedure passes off efficiently and\
  \ painlessly.\nBut the most important lesson I have learned is that I am now armed\
  \ with a stupendously effective conversational gambit. Let us imagine, just for\
  \ one wild moment, that one of these days I actually get invited to a swish sophisticated\
  \ cocktail party where I can lean insouciantly against a mantelpiece. Now picture\
  \ various other guests approaching me to engage in conversation with what they fondly\
  \ imagine will be impressive anecdotes.\n\u201CLet me tell you about the time I\
  \ met John F Kennedy\u201D, would say my ex-employer Elkan Allan (were he not late\
  \ and lamented). Or, \u201COne of my blog posts was picked up by the Huffington\
  \ Post\u201D, would say my sister Rita Byrne Tull. Or it might be someone telling\
  \ me they had climbed Everest, or swum the Channel, or discovered the Fab Four,\
  \ or any number of thrilling facts.\nAnd now imagine a moment of silence, while\
  \ I pause and play that pause for all it's worth, and I then say, \u201CWell, that's\
  \ very interesting\u201D, and then I declare, in resounding tones, \u201CBut every\
  \ two weeks I have needles injected directly into my eyeballs!\u201D\nI can assure\
  \ you that the effect is electrifying. I have already tried it out a few times\u2014\
  though sadly not in the context of a swish sophisticated cocktail party\u2014and\
  \ I can report that jaws drop, eyes boggle, and questions are fired at me. I, of\
  \ course, retain an air of insouciant calm.\nI tell you what, as medical issues\
  \ go, this one certainly beats water-on-the-knee or mad cow disease when it comes\
  \ to mopping the floor with rival anecdotists.\n[2016-08-14]"
