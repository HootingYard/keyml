  In those dark times, astrologer, mathematician and conjuror were accounted the same
  things, and the vulgar did verily believe [Thomas Allen] to be a conjuror. He had
  a great many mathematical instruments and glasses in his chamber, which did also
  confirm the ignorant in their opinion, and his servitor (to impose on freshmen and
  simple people) would tell them that sometimes he should meet the spirits, coming
  up his stairs like bees.
