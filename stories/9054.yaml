text: "Part One, Part Two, and now \u2026\n\u201CWell, lad,\u201D said the navigator\
  \ to Buttercase as the two sat in the stifling squalor of the Indescribable's chart\
  \ room, \u201CAs you can see, I'm plotting our course on these portolans. It's exacting\
  \ work. I am a very ancient, craggy man, the sort you sometimes hear referred to\
  \ as a sea dog, or old salt. I have been at sea since I was much younger than you\
  \ are now, first as a deckhand, then as a bilge-boy. Only in my fifties did I aspire\
  \ to the position of navigator. It took twenty years of arduous study for me to\
  \ reach my present state of knowledge, where I can be entrusted, single-handed,\
  \ to take this mighty steamship across the world, issuing instructions to the louts\
  \ on the bridge to steer this way or that, to correct the course by so many degrees,\
  \ to hold fast to port or starboard, etc etc.\u201D He spat into his mahogany spittoon.\
  \ \u201CMy training began when I became a second deputy assistant to the navigator's\
  \ mate on a fine old wooden ship the name of which escapes me. Aye, your memory\
  \ plays some rum old tricks, lad, when you get to my age. Day and night I watched\
  \ the chief navigator, bewildered at the subtlety of his art. I perched in a little\
  \ hammock just above his left shoulder, making careful notes of all he did in my\
  \ notebook. I rarely slept. Eventually\u2014oh, it was a long time\u2014I felt I\
  \ had gained some semblance of understanding.\n\u201CThen disaster struck. At midnight\
  \ on the fourth of June 18\u2013, a storm blew up, and that delicate ship was smashed\
  \ asunder on some rocks. Only three of us survived. We managed to clamber into a\
  \ dinghy, as the tempest howled around our ears. For fourteen weeks we drifted in\
  \ the pitiless ocean, subsisting on rotten biscuits, pemmican, and the occasional\
  \ seahorse we were able to spear with our bayonets. I passed the thirst-crazed days\
  \ having frantic arguments with Mufton and Hairball, my companions, who became steadily\
  \ more and more enraged with me, because I kept whingeing about my notebook. I had\
  \ lost it in the very teeth of the storm, you see, and thus all my years of navigational\
  \ study were as nought. You can understand why I whimpered so, can you not? Eventually\
  \ they grew so sick of my moaning that they hurled me over the side. In the middle\
  \ of the night, they grabbed me, Mufton taking my legs and Hairball my arms, and\
  \ they swung me overboard, cackling like maniacs, and I splashed into the freezing\
  \ sea, helpless and alone. Luckily I had secreted the remainder of the biscuit supply\
  \ in my blazer pocket. There was no moon; I could see nothing. I trod water for\
  \ hours, terrified that at any moment I would be attacked by all sorts of fiendish\
  \ aquatic monsters. But none came. I munched the biscuits and moistened my parched\
  \ lips with the last few dregs of my spittle. The silence was unendurable. I croaked\
  \ old hymns, dredged up from memory. Sleep, I knew, would be fatal, even for a few\
  \ seconds. Just as I was about to pass out, my luck came in. An enormous crab clawed\
  \ its way up on to my scalp, where it perched, tweaking my hair agonisingly in its\
  \ pincers. The pain kept me awake, and I began to hallucinate, but the visions were\
  \ so mundane that I will not bore you with them. Suddenly, as dawn broke, I felt\
  \ solid ground beneath my feet. Peering around, I saw that I had drifted on to an\
  \ island. Crawling on to the strand, I shovelled a few handfuls of nearby crustacea\
  \ into my mouth, swallowed them having hardly bothered to crunch them, and fell\
  \ into an exhausted sleep.\n\u201CWhen I awoke it was pouring with rain. For as\
  \ long as I remained on the island the rain never ceased. Bear that in mind, as\
  \ I tell you the rest of my adventures.\u201D The old sea dog took a plug of tobacco\
  \ from behind his ear and lodged it between his teeth. \u201CThe island on which\
  \ I had fetched up was small, but well-provided for in terms of foliage and nourishment.\
  \ It was the shape of a dromedary. The air stank. After eleven weeks\u2014during\
  \ which I was absolutely drenched by the rain\u2014I was rescued by a passing ship,\
  \ the captain of which was the most devilish cur alive. His name was Lapwing, his\
  \ flesh was orange, he wore a violet hat, and his pipe-smoke curled around his head\
  \ so that he was forever in a fog. His crew were so terrified of him that they all\
  \ assumed a permanent crouch, and suffered agonising back pain as a consequence.\
  \ The ship's doctor\u2014a saintly man named Bagshaw, or Shawbag, I forget which\u2014\
  hardly had a moment's rest. He was forever having to rub linaments and ointments\
  \ on to the men's backs to sooth the rictus, and had constructed a fascinating piece\
  \ of equipment, an oak frame almost like a rack, on which four men could lie at\
  \ a time, having their bodies stretched to counter the effects of their crouching,\
  \ the doctor making incremental adjustments to a large red wheel with a special\
  \ lever inserted in a hole in the rim. The dastardly captain knew nothing of this.\
  \ The treatment was always administered at night, while he slept, and the machine\
  \ was hidden from him during the day behind huge crates of cargo\u2014tin, bitumen,\
  \ custard\u2014in the darkest recesses of the hold.\n\u201CWhen they hauled my soaking\
  \ body aboard, Captain Lapwing immediately set me to work as the doctor's assistant,\
  \ replenishing the linament jars and holding Bagshaw's massive fringe of hair out\
  \ of his eyes as he went about his duties. I was also put in charge of the small\
  \ colony of badgers which lived below decks. Procuring food for them was no easy\
  \ matter, but I too was terrified of Lapwing, and I soon learned to entice a bowl\
  \ of badger food from the least promising ingredients. It is a skill that has not\
  \ deserted me. You may have noticed, lad, that I still keep a little team of badgers\
  \ in my cabin. Dobbin is my favourite, rather frisky for his species, but a treasure\
  \ nonetheless.\u201D\n\u201CI hate to interrupt you,\u201D said Buttercase, \u201C\
  But shouldn't you be paying more attention to the charts?\u201D\nThose of you who\
  \ recall the newspaper reports of the Glub expedition will be aware that Buttercase\
  \ never reached the Antarctic. The navigator was so inept that he took the ship\
  \ not to the Southern seas, but to the lemur-riddled western coast of Sumatra, in\
  \ the Dutch East Indies.\nTo be continued \u2026\n[2012-05-03]"
