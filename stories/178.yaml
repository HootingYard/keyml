text: "Young Stalin sounds like an instructive and entertaining biography, and I will\
  \ add it to my reading list. I mention it here, though, simply as an excuse to celebrate\
  \ the name of the author, Simon Sebag Montefiore. I want that middle name! Granted,\
  \ Frank Sebag Key does not have the mellifluous multisyllabic beauty of Simon Sebag\
  \ Montefiore, but it will have to do.\nHerman Melville's Moby Dick; or The Whale\
  \ is a work of matchless genius, and it may be considered sacrilege to tamper with\
  \ the text. I can't help but feel, however, that if the opening line was \u201C\
  Call me Sebag\u201D it would somehow be even better.\nIncidentally, I discovered\
  \ that Simon Sebag Montefiore is married to the sister of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.\
  \ A rich pap-brained partygoer is an unlikely Hooting Yard heroine, but I have had\
  \ a measure of admiration for Ms Palmer-Tomkinson ever since, on television a few\
  \ years ago, she uttered the immortal line \u201CThose are Uri's underpants. Burn\
  \ them\u201D. Uri being, of course, the dismal charlatan Uri Geller.\n[2007-05-24]"
