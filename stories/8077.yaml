text: "Today would have been my father's 87th birthday. In a change of tone from the\
  \ usual Hooting Yard guff, here is a remembrance of him. Following Georges Perec's\
  \ Je me souviens (1978) and Gilbert Adair's Memories (1986), I have written, in\
  \ no particular order, a set of sentences each beginning \u201CI remember\u2026\u201D\
  \ There are fifty-eight in all, one for each year of his life. I wrote them at one\
  \ sitting, as they bubbled to the surface. On another day I might write a different\
  \ list of memories.\n1. I remember he smoked a cheap brand of cigarettes called\
  \ Carlton Premium.\n2. I remember the Evening Standard ringing him up after he made\
  \ disparaging remarks about Dr Rhodes Boyson, though I don't remember the context,\
  \ or how the paper knew.\n3. I remember his love of crime fiction.\n4. I remember\
  \ his love of football, and that\u2014uniquely among aficionados of the game?\u2014\
  he did not support any particular team.\n5. I remember his hip-flask of Scotch.\n\
  6. I remember seeing him cry only once, when talking about his father.\n7. I remember\
  \ him using the nickname \u201CBrucie\u201D for my mother.\n8. I remember when his\
  \ choice of hat convinced some of our neighbours that he was a Russian spy.\n9.\
  \ I remember he read The Guardian and the Morning Star.\n10. I remember he always\
  \ called The Guardian The Manchester Guardian\n11. I remember him wandering around\
  \ the house with a tea-towel over his shoulder calling out \u201CAny more pots?\u201D\
  \n12. I remember he called Ready-Brek Fairex.\n13. I remember precisely the style\
  \ of his spectacle-frames.\n14. I remember the way he referred to Norman St John\
  \ Stevas as \u201CSte-VASS\u201D.\n15. I remember that he subscribed to a Soviet\
  \ propaganda magazine called Sputnik.\n16. I remember him dusting individually the\
  \ books on the bookshelves.\n17. I remember his habit of cutting off the corners\
  \ of dust-jackets where the price was shown.\n18. I remember him saying \u201CThe\
  \ whole point is\u2026\u201D\n19. I remember his afternoon naps on the sofa.\n20.\
  \ I remember his loud snoring\n21. I remember him saying \u201CIt's like Blackpool\
  \ Illuminations\u201D when a light was left on in an empty room.\n22. I remember\
  \ his psoriasis.\n23. I remember him telling me that when he played football as\
  \ a young man he was nicknamed \u201CTwinkletoes\u201D.\n24. I remember his hatred\
  \ of Reginald Maudling but also his insistence, when Maudling died, that one should\
  \ never speak ill of the dead.\n25. I remember his sentimentality.\n26. I remember\
  \ that Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942) was his favourite film.\n27. I remember\
  \ him taking me to a Manchester United match (at Upton Park?) and how his Manchester\
  \ accent became unconsciously exaggerated when speaking to other fans.\n28. I remember\
  \ him saying \u201Cdaft as a Toc H Lamp\u201D.\n29. I remember his puritanical streak.\n\
  30. I remember his dismissal of anything other than the plainest foods as \u201C\
  foreign muck\u201D.\n31. I remember him telling me how he had gone to the Chinese\
  \ embassy to be given a free copy of Mao's Little Red Book (which I still have).\n\
  32. I remember his fierce attachment to his mother.\n33. I remember him polishing\
  \ his shoes.\n34. I remember that the bottle of Guinness he drank with his evening\
  \ meal was \u201Cmedicinal\u201D.\n35. I remember kicking a football around in the\
  \ garden with him.\n36. I remember when he wore a shirt with a collar that made\

  \ uxoriousness.\n49. I remember his infuriating habit of tidying that which was\
  \ already tidy.\n50. I remember his insistence that one should always have an up-to-date\

  55.I remember his postcard collection.\n56. I remember his big florid curly handwriting.\n\
  57. I remember that he always wore a vest under his shirt.\n58. I remember clearly\
  \ the last time I saw him, sitting at his desk, reading the paper, drinking whisky,\
  \ on the morning of Monday 16 May 1983. He died two days later.\n[2012-01-09]"
