text: "Mooching about Interwebshire*, it is easy to forget those long ago days spent\
  \ in the seedy village of Inksmudge. Although there are umpteen websites devoted\
  \ to all sorts of past publishing glories, it is rare\u2014at least in my experience\u2014\
  to chance upon an item I clearly remember snipping out of an old inky paper and\
  \ slotting in to my teenage cuttings pile. (Why did I never bother to paste things\
  \ into a scrapbook?)\nThose heaps of printstuff were, for the most part, lost or\
  \ abandoned or buried or burned to a cinder many years ago. So I was delighted,\
  \ this morning, roaming through the shire, to find this snippet, almost certainly\
  \ from NME circa 1974. It still makes me laugh, though perhaps now accompanied by\
  \ a lump in my throat. Tempus fugit, lost youth, blah blah blah\u2026\n\n* NOTE\_\
  : A term coined, as far as I'm aware, by John Barleycorn at the much-missed\_According\
