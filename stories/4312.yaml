text: "\u201CThrough a blue haze one saw the ground, covered with snow, shining under\
  \ the magical moon\u2026 A piercing wind blew from the frozen river\u2014the muff\u2014\
  if it would come it would keep her warm\u2014\u2026 Like a knife they went through\
  \ my soul\u2014Rose petals\u2014\u2026 I had been the momentary victim of a freakish\
  \ fancy\u2026 The rain irritated me\u2026 Through her tears she saw a star shining\
  \ in the night\u2026 War\u2014It had shattered homes\u2014brought skeletons\u2014\
  where once children laughed. Brought famine\u2014once birds had eaten crumbs\u2026\
  \ Little fool muttered the maddened officer\u2026 A night of drunkenness, of horror,\
  \ had passed in the Belgian chateau\u2026 Play on, he whispered. Play for me\u2014\
  for England\u2014whose son I am\u2026 She saw no friends\u2014the ones of former\
  \ days\u2014Nihilists. They were perhaps hiding in foreign lands\u2014or were in\
  \ the darker seclusion of some Siberian Prison\u2026 Speak, speak\u2014Angel or\
  \ demon, or both, speak to me before I throw you into the sea\u2026 The alienist\
  \ gave his testimony. The prisoner was mad. Clearly\u2026 I shall have ceased forever,\
  \ I hope, to count the bars of my iron door, my sole occupation and the one thing\
  \ which keeps me from thinking too much of the past, so bitter\u2026 Lydia\u2014\
  risen from the ashes\u2014walked out into the snow and cold\u2026 I found myself\
  \ in a small room, blue with smoke and poorly furnished. An old man was cooking\
  \ supper, as he hummed some weird old gypsy tune\u2026 The snow is falling and covering\
  \ in white the grim rows of houses opposite my little shop, the streets are deserted\
  \ save by a few hurrying pedestrians and some merry school children going down to\
  \ the frozen river for an hour's skating before dusk\u2014\u2026 On the steps of\
  \ this now abandoned house sat the muttering old woman\u2026 Strange, weird music\
  \ of the desert played by slaves\u2026 The agonizing sorrow of Gethsemane again\
  \ swept over Christ, as He stood by the Lake.\u201D\nWhat was that all about? Let\
  \ me enlighten you. I took a snippet from each of the extraordinary Futurist Stories\
  \ by Margery Verner Reed, published in 1919, and cobbled them together. I hope this\
  \ drastic abridgement will persuade you to read the entire book. This is passionate,\
  \ sometimes hallucinatory, prose, unlike anything I have read before, as if bulky\
  \ 19th century novels had been boiled down to their emotional essentials.\nWho was\
  \ Margery Verner Reed, and in what sense did she understand Futurism? I have been\
  \ unable to discover anything about her save that she also wrote Under-Currents\
  \ and the splendidly-titled Prose Petals. Tireless literary researchers are implored\
  \ to add their ha'porth in the Comments.\n[2010-04-22]"
