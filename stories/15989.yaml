  Hot off the possibly magnetic etherwaves, in today''s episode of Hooting Yard On
  The Air, Mr Key turns his attention to Little Bo Peep, hendiadys in Mudchute, a
  spot of juvenilia, an account of the day he forgot his own head, and the ghost of
  Doris Stockhausen. With luck, Miss Blossom Partridge''s Knitting Half-Hour will
  be back next week.
