text: "In his scholarly introduction to By Aerostat To Hooting Yard, Roland Clare\
  \ writes: \u201CThe Bad Vicarage is a very funny piece that epitomises not only\
  \ the moral instability of Hooting Yard but also Key's desire to puncture the very\
  \ illusion of reality that naturalistic authors are at pains to sustain. Even if\
  \ the rest of the story were sensible\u2014rest assured, it is not\u2014there is\
  \ no easy way we can come to terms with the unreliability of a narrator who first\
  \ wonders what has become of the \u2018Bad Vicar\u2019, then reveals himself to\
  \ be the incumbent in question.\u201D\nThe estimable Walt O'Hara of Airy Persiflage\
  \ says: \u201CNot for the faint of heart, Mr. Key's spine tingling tale of a monstrous\
  \ vicar of old and the evil that he wrought!\u201D You can enjoy the pleasurably\
  \ disconcerting experience of listening to the tale read by Mr O'Hara here.\n[2014-04-15]"
