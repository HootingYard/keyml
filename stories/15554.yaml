text: "\nThis magnificent book, packed with piggery, tells us, among much else, that\n\
  old-fashioned pigs \u2026 are extremely likeable characters. They are highly intelligent,\
  \ exceedingly amiable \u2026 and will follow you about like a dog. They have a keen\
  \ sense of the absurd and will suddenly take off in a collective giddy fit, twirling\
  \ round and round to the accompaniment of hoarse pantings, guffaws, it might almost\
  \ be said, of merriment.\n[2017-08-12]"
