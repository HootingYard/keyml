text: "In a pioneering new work of social history, Dot Tint focuses her beady bluestocking\
  \ eye\u2014through a lorgnette, we assume\u2014upon the Festival Of Argumentative\
  \ Music At \u1E7Alm. To be precise, she examines the first occasion on which the\
  \ festival was broadcast over what used to be called the wireless, back in one of\
  \ those years in the first half of the twentieth century.\nIn an age of apples and\
  \ pods, it can be a bit of a strain for us to imagine the excitement generated by\
  \ the news that peasants in far-flung hovels would be able to listen to the goings\
  \ on live from \u1E7Alm. Dot Tint writes: \u201CWhen \_it was announced that the\
  \ full programme of concerts, workshops, provocations and shouty stuff would be\
  \ broadcast, there were outbreaks of mass hysteria in the countryside. Farmhands\
  \ fainted in the fields. Hens acted weirdly in their coops. Wells were poisoned,\
  \ and cows became fractious.\u201D\nMany countryside wirelesses in those days were\
  \ primitive pieces of kit bolted together from odds and ends of metal and wiring\
  \ and bakelite panels. The fact that, as soon as one depressed the starter knob,\
  \ they began to hiss and crackle and emit ear-splitting shrieks made them the perfect\
  \ medium for listening to the racket from \u1E7Alm.\nThe festival that year was\
  \ devised by a singularly bad-tempered Teutonic hothead by the name of Klaus Krank.\
  \ Dot Tint's pen-portrait of him includes the fascinating note that \u201Ceven the\
  \ furrows of his tempestuous brows were themselves furrowed, deeply so, deep as\
  \ the grave wherein my friend was laid\u201D. She does not tell us who this friend\
  \ might be, not even in a footnote, and I would have liked a footnote, given that\
  \ the rest of her text is fairly riddled with them, sometimes two or three to a\
  \ page, in tiny, tiny type, so tiny that I have had to crack the spine of my review\
  \ copy to flatten it so that I can place it on a platen and view it through the\
  \ lens of a large important industrial magnification instrument. It might be argued\u2014\
  it has been argued\u2014that I would be better off getting my eyes tested and wearing\
  \ a pair of prescription spectacles, or contact lenses, but why the hell should\
  \ I? I see no reason to be cowed by the gradual, inevitable dilapidation of my physical\
  \ self, by the relentless withering away of my senses. I shall fight that dereliction\
  \ with every atrophying fibre of my being, and, where necessary, with large important\
  \ industrial magnification instruments. Like Dot Tint's unnamed friend, I too will\
  \ one day be laid in a grave as deep as the furrows, or rather the secondary furrows,\
  \ of Klaus Krank's mighty brows, and until that time comes I shall simply refuse,\
  \ in a booming voice, to be extinguished. As the poet Dennis Beerpint wrote, \u201C\
  Do not prance winsomely into that grave / Rage, rage against the [something], Dave\u201D\
  \ in his verse Lines Upon The Imminent Death Of Dave, My Pet Viper.\nBeerpint was\
  \ not yet born when the Festival Of Argumentative Music At \u1E7Alm was first broadcast\
  \ on primitive wireless sets. One wonders how he might have tackled a commission\
  \ to write a threnody for it, to be set to music by one of Klaus Krank's hotchpotch\
  \ collection of composers, each outdoing the others in misanthropy and general grumpiness.\
  \ Yet theirs was a grumpiness of a very earnest, serious-minded sort, and they wrote\
  \ music to match. The lucky peasants who tuned in to the wireless in their windswept\
  \ fenland hovels were treated to such masterworks as Six Bagatelles Upon A Windswept\
  \ Fenland Hovel by Von Straubenzee, The Drainage Ditch Variations by Ack, and Lullaby\
  \ For A Cow Felled By Ergot Poisoning by Ergott.\nThe great value of Dot Tint's\
  \ book is that she makes explicit the link between the confrontational nature of\
  \ much of the music and the violent altercations between Klaus Krank and the composers\
  \ and the ticket sellers and the security patrols and the audience and the paramedics\
  \ and the wireless engineers and the dog handlers and the piano detuners and the\
  \ ratcatchers and the festival docents at \u1E7Alm. Not only that, but she puts\
  \ it in the wider context of Uruguayan political intrigues of the time. She blithely\
  \ dismisses the predictable objection that \u1E7Alm is not even on the same continent\
  \ as Uruguay in prose that glistens like a jewel. She even appends a picture of\
  \ such a jewel, in the form of a mezzotint by her brother, the noted mezzotintist\
  \ Rex Tint.\nIt is one of several such mezzotints in the book, which also contains\
  \ a small selection of photographs. The one reproduced below purports to show Tiny\
  \ Enid, Mrs Gubbins, and Old Farmer Frack listening to the broadcast of Klaus Krank's\
  \ own Festival Overture For Cello, Pots And Pans, And Electronically Modified Corncrake,\
  \ but this cannot be right, as the three of them are known never to have occupied\
  \ the same time and space upon this or any other planet. Dot Tint confirms as much\
  \ in a highly amusing Erratum slip inserted into my copy of the book.\n\n\_\n[2009-03-10]"
