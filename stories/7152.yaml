text: "Seven years ago at Hooting Yard, this\u2026\nPeople often wonder why a bird\
  \ sanctuary was created at Bodger's Spinney, for it is a somewhat gloomy spot. The\
  \ moving spirit behind this avian paradise on earth was one Merrill Stubing, a man\
  \ who, incidentally, was later to share his name with a fictional character. Although\
  \ they had nought else in common, this was the name of the captain of The Love Boat,\
  \ an exciting television series of the 1970s, long after the real \u201CBird Man\u201D\
  \ Stubing was dead.\nBesotted with birds, Stubing lit upon Bodger's Spinney as the\
  \ perfect place for his planned sanctuary after accidentally wandering across it\
  \ when he got lost on a Sunday morning jaunt with his colleagues from the Pastry\
  \ Works. Hurling his considerable energy into the project, Stubing called for a\
  \ meeting of interested parties, where he outlined his vision as follows:\nAnd the\
  \ streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone,\
  \ and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night\
  \ nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation\
  \ it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. But the cormorant\
  \ and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it;\
  \ and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.\n\
  And that, children, is why there is a bird sanctuary at Bodger's Spinney.\n[2011-08-20]"
