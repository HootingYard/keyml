  Over at The Dabbler today you will find Old Key''s Almanacke, a list of a dozen
  prognostications of what will befall us in the coming twelvemonth. The spooky thing
  about Old Key is that he has been proved unerringly accurate, time and time again.
  I am not entirely sure who he is, or was, other than that his papers were discovered
  in a shoebox underneath a sink in a cubby in an old manse perched on a windswept
  hillside. The papers, bound into a series of Almanackes, had been piddled upon by
  generations of feral cats. On the rotting linoleum next to the shoebox lay a wand
  and a pointy hat. They too had been piddled upon, by something bigger and more terrible
  than a feral cat.
