text: "Yesterday I went to a concert given by William D Drake. One of the songs he\
  \ and his band performed was a splendid setting of a sonnet by Michael Drayton (1563\u2013\
  1631), a poet of whom I confess I had never heard before. Here is a portrait, and\
  \ the poem:\n\nWhen first I ended, then I first began;\nThen more I travelled further\
  \ from my rest.\nWhere most I lost, there most of all I won;\nPin\xE8d with hunger,\
  \ rising from a feast.\nMethinks I fly, yet want I legs to go,\nWise in conceit,\
  \ in act a very sot,\nRavished with joy amidst a hell of woe,\nWhat most I seem\
  \ that surest am I not.\nI build my hopes a world above the sky,\nYet with the mole\
  \ I creep into the earth;\nIn plenty I am starved with penury,\nAnd yet I surfeit\
  \ in the greatest dearth.\nI have, I want, despair, and yet desire,\nBurned in a\
  \ sea of ice, and drowned amidst a fire.\n[2010-05-29]"
