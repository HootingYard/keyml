text: "Malcolm Muggeridge describes \u201Cfact-finding\u201D tourists to Stalin's\
  \ Soviet Union in The Thirties (1940):\nTheir delight in all they saw and were told,\
  \ and the expression they gave to this delight, constitute unquestionably one of\
  \ the wonders of our age. There were earnest advocates of the humane killing of\
  \ cattle who looked up at the massive headquarters of the Ogpu with tears of gratitude\
  \ in their eyes, earnest advocates of proportional representation who eagerly assented\
  \ when the necessity for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat was explained to them,\
  \ earnest clergymen who walked reverently through anti-God museums and reverently\
  \ turned the pages of atheistic literature, earnest pacifists who watched delightedly\
  \ tanks rattle across the Red Square and bombing planes darken the sky, earnest\
  \ town-planning specialists who stood outside overcrowded ramshackle tenements and\
  \ muttered: \u201CIf only we had something like this in England!\u201D The almost\
  \ unbelievable credulity of these mostly university-educated tourists astonished\
  \ even Soviet officials used to handling foreign visitors.\n[2013-02-01]"
