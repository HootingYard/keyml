text: "The harebells are in bloom, and there is a man prancing along, waving a stick.\
  \ There is phlox and flax, campions, pinks, hollyhocks and bee borage, chrysanthemums\
  \ and vetch, dahlias, hyacinths and delphiniums, and all the colours seem reflected\
  \ in the man's cravat. It is silken, and embroidered with fantastic skill. One admires\
  \ the casual yet stylish way he has knotted it about his neck. His hat, too, with\
  \ its elegant angles, is pleasing to the eye. He rounds a pond, still waving his\
  \ stick. The pond is home to mergansers, teal, and some ferocious swans. The sun\
  \ emerges from behind an impossibly fluffy cloud, and bathes the scene in light\
  \ so bright it bleaches the colour from things. The man makes a pause and dips his\
  \ hand into a pocket of his blazer, from whence he plucks a pair of sunglasses and\
  \ in one easy movement slides them behind his ears and onto his nose, while still\
  \ managing that rhythmic wave of the stick with his other hand. A flock of swallows\
  \ swoops across the sky. The man continues walking, now past a large stone edifice,\
  \ quite a wonder of masonry. It looks as if it has been plumped down here in this\
  \ field at random, long ago, for in parts it is crumbling, and it is tilted where\
  \ the ground has subsided slightly beneath it. Much writing is carved upon one face\
  \ of it, and the man stops, and stops waving his stick, and reads the words.\nHERE\
  \ LIE THE MORTAL BONES OF THE MIGHTY KING AND CHAMPION VUGLOP THRUST BY SWORD AND\
  \ FIRE INTO THE ETHEREAL GREY MIST BEYOND WHO IN HIS TIME SMASHED ALL ON EARTH THAT\
  \ HAD TO BE SMASHED AND IN HIS REIGN SPOKE WITH BIRDS AND IN HIS KINGDOM DID LET\
  \ GROW TOWERING HOLLYHOCKS AND TREES OF QUINCE HE UNDID HIS FOES AND SPIES AND SCUM\
  \ HIS HEAD WAS HUGE HIS CRANIUM SOLID AS THE ROCK OF BEDSOE FROM WHICH THIS TOMB\
  \ HAS BEEN HEWN TO MARK THE SPOT WHERE HE FELL ON THAT AWFUL DAY WHEN PUNY WANKERS\
  \ THROUGH LEGERDEMAIN AND CONJURING TRICKED HIS MAJESTIC PERSON AND BROUGHT HIS\
  \ REALM TO RUIN HIS BONES ROT AND HIS FLESH BE EATEN BY WORMS HIS MEMORY HELD IN\
  \ THE BEAKS OF THE BIRDS AND THE\_ PIPS AND BUDS AND PETALS OF THE FRUITS AND FLOWERS\
  \ O MIGHTY VUGLOP LET THINE ENEMIES SHRIVEL UP IN TERROR AT YOUR MAGNIFICENCE THIS\
  \ DAY AND ALL DAYS HENCE UNTIL YOUR KINGDOM IS BUILT AGAIN WITH STONE AND SWEAT\
  \ THEN BALLOONS AND BIG FLYING MACHINES WILL SOAR ACROSS THE SKY PROCLAIMING ON\
  \ BANNERS TO ALL ON EARTH YOUR GLORY IT SHALL BE\nAll of this is in Latin, or possibly\
  \ Goat Latin, but we are given subtitles. Having read it, the man spits upon the\
  \ masonry, and strolls on, again waving his stick. Suddenly, in the harsh sunlight,\
  \ from nowhere, comes a trio of grunting toughs, who maul and manhandle him to the\
  \ ground and drag him into a pit. The light grows brighter until the screen is completely\
  \ white, and then appear, in a lovely font, bold and black, the words:\n\u201CI\
  \ Profaned A King's Tomb\u201D\u2014Peter De Vries, The Mackerel Plaza, MCMLVIII\n\
  Thus the opening of Horst Gack's new film Oubliette Of Fops, the follow-up to his\
  \ award-winning Het Ontbijt. Where that earlier masterpiece limited itself to a\
  \ small group of Belgians eating breakfast in a cafeteria, this latest work operates\
  \ on a much broader canvas, at least in terms of ambition. Granted, after the opening\
  \ scene the bulk of the \u201Caction\u201D, if we can call it that, takes place\
  \ in the oubliette of the title, a tenebrous hellhole scarcely more expansive than\
  \ the breakfast cafeteria, in which various semivisible fops and bravos groan and\
  \ languish. But this is primarily a film of ideas, ideas hatched not by Horst Gack\
  \ but by his wife and collaboratrix Primrose Dent, international woman of mystery.\
  \ So what we have, over three or more hours, is a series of meditations upon kingship,\
  \ temporal power, being eaten by worms, and the desperate quandary of fops consigned\
  \ to an oubliette for profaning a king long dead. \u201CIf we live we live to tread\
  \ on dead kings\u201D go the words of the song, and this perhaps was the refrain\
  \ running through Primrose Dent's head as she wrote the screenplay while jetting\
  \ between important capital cities, staying in expensive hotels, and sipping cocktails\
  \ on terraces which, not so long ago, or not too far in the future, ran or would\
  \ yet run with the blood spilled by revolutionaries or counterrevolutionaries, and\
  \ in some cases by irredentists. It is this context which makes the film so rich,\
  \ so appealing, and it certainly compensates for Horst Gack's trademark cackhanded\
  \ camerawork and those infuriating longueurs of which he seems so fond. Or perhaps,\
  \ as the critic Giles Lapwing has asserted more than once, the prizewinning director\
  \ is simply a hapless incompetent.\nOddly enough, Lapwing himself actually has a\
  \ walk-on part in the film. In a piece of bravura hyperrealism, Horst Gack shows\
  \ him being abducted from his Pointy Town pied \xE0 terre, bundled on to a rickety\
  \ cart, and driven by wild horses across a desolate and unspeakable landscape before\
  \ being thrown by the same trio of toughs into the oubliette. What are Horst Gack\
  \ and mysterious Primrose Dent trying to tell us here? For if there is one thing\
  \ the world knows about Giles Lapwing it is that he is the most unfoppish of men.\
  \ Indeed, such is the general shabbiness of his appearance and demeanour that he\
  \ has on countless occasions been ejected from sophisticated soir\xE9es, much like\
  \ the Emerald Isle crooner Van Morrison. Sometimes the pair of them have been kicked\
  \ into the streets in tandem, memorably when trying to gain access to their own\
  \ joint birthday party at the Grand Metropolitan Palace o\u2019 Fops \u2018n\u2019\
  \ Dandies on the quayside regeneration zone at O'Houlihan's Wharf. By all accounts\
  \ Lapwing and Morrison were pursued by outraged Palace habitu\xE9s to the end of\
  \ the pier, whereupon they toppled into the sea and had to swim out to a barnacle-encrusted\
  \ rock.\nOubliette Of Fops is certainly a challenging piece of cinema, and it will\
  \ be interesting to see what the critics make of it, if, indeed, any of them get\
  \ a chance to see it. Word has it that while Horst Gack is preening himself ready\
  \ for the festival circuit, Primrose Dent is keeping all existing prints of the\
  \ film under lock and key in one of her mysterious secret cavernous subterranean\
  \ secure storage facilities. There are at least four of these on each continent,\
  \ their exact locations of course known only to the international woman of mystery\
  \ herself. Horst Gack is apparently ignorant of their existence, happily accepting\
  \ his wife's increasingly gnomic pronouncements, issued in the form of scribbled\
  \ notes passed over the breakfast table. It is reminiscent of the scene in Het Ontbijt,\
  \ where the husband and wife at the cafeteria's corner table pass coded teabags\
  \ to each other.\nThere are at present no plans to release Oubliette Of Fops in\
  \ 3D, though apparently a Smellovision version is on the cards. The smells will\
  \ be those of lemon verbena, turpentine, and snackbar fug.\n[2010-04-21]"
