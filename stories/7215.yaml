  \ something approaching poetry.\nThe friend who I thumped on the bonce with the\
  \ Hammer of Thumpiness, until she caved in and began blogging, is only six posts\
  \ in at BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet, yet her grasp of tagging is a wonder to behold.\
  \ Consider this:\nmemory\nrain\nSwanage\nwind\nWhat a corker! Time, surely, to eject\
  \ Carol Ann Duffy* from the Laureateship and appoint my friend in her stead.\n*\
