text: "During the past few days, postie has been struggling along the lane towards\
  \ Haemoglobin Towers heaving a sack filled, not, I am afraid to say, with seasonal\
  \ greetings cards, but with tear-stained letters from listeners to the Hooting Yard\
  \ radio show on Resonance 104.4 FM. Lazy writers, and those of a hackneyed bent,\
  \ are fond of describing tears as \u201Ccopious\u201D. I thought I had the full\
  \ measure of that word until postie tipped out the daily sack of correspondence.\
  \ By god, every single envelope was drenched, drenched with the salty sobbings of\
  \ ungovernable anguish. I had to make use of a sponge and a mop before I could open\
  \ them and read the scribbled lamentations therein.\nThe cause of all this misery\
  \ is that this year I failed to record a Hooting Yard Christmas Special. A twelvemonth\
  \ ago, if you recall, Resonance broadcast my reading of Sylvia Townsend Warner's\
  \ selection from The Natural History Of Selborne by Gilbert White detailing the\
  \ activities of Timothy the Tortoise, and the year before that I was given a whopping\
  \ three hours of airtime to recite, with Germander Speedwell, Christopher Smart's\
  \ poem Jubilate Agno, a reading which proved to be an historic piece of radio.\n\
  Alas, come this year's festive season I simply could not alight upon a suitable\
  \ text. I pondered reading bits from A Withered Garland Of Mawkish Pap by Prudence\
  \ Foxglove, but somehow it seemed too withered and mawkish. I was tempted by the\
  \ idea of broadcasting two of Richard Nixon's Six Crises, but was unable to choose\
  \ among them. For a while I even considered devoting a programme to the latest sorry\
  \ outpourings of beatnik poet Dennis Beerpint, but neither I nor the radio station\
  \ could face the prospect of the inevitable legal proceedings. So, with some regret,\
  \ I threw in the towel, which was a pity, because I could have used it to more effectively\
  \ soak up the tears contained in postie's sacks. The sponge and the mop only did\
  \ half the job.\nAnyway, all I can do is to apologise, and to suggest to the bereft\
  \ that they hie on over to the Wikipedia page for Jubilate Agno. Scroll down, and\
  \ there at the foot of the page, you will find a link to my and Ms Speedwell's reading,\
  \ preserved forever on the interweb. May I recommend listening to it in its entirety,\
  \ at top volume, every day?\nOh, and I have exciting news! After untold years in\
  \ preparation, Jubilate Agno\_: The Motion Picture is due to be screened at your\
  \ local multiplex early in the new year. Directed by Mel Gibson, starring Christopher\
  \ Plummer and using old footage of Valentine Dyall and Basil Rathbone, this epic\
  \ production has already won plaudits from my favourite film critic, the grunting\
  \ and snaggle-toothed peasant with a rusty spade who stands, mysteriously, under\
  \ an elm tree at the edge of the cemetery, spitting at crows.\n[2009-12-24]"
