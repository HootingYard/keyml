text: "\u201CThe Bats of Remorse hang upside down in the Cave of Grief.\u201D Discuss.\n\
  Model Answer\_: It is a fact of nature that bats, sometimes many hundreds of them,\
  \ hang upside down in caves. The author is making use of this image to comment upon\
  \ human frailty, specifically the emotionally disruptive lacerations of remorse\
  \ and grief. Bats are linked with remorse, the cave with grief. As we read and digest\
  \ the phrase, tears well up in our eyes, and we begin to sob. Our past griefs may\
  \ come tumbling back inside our heads, the inside of the head very much like a cave,\
  \ if we think of the skull as stone, with crags and dents. The flutterings we feel\
  \ inside it, synapses snapping as we are racked by remorse, can be thought of as\
  \ bats swooping in to the cave to take up their perches. Once in place, they hang\
  \ there twitching occasionally, just as the lashings of remorse twitch within the\
  \ porale of grief. Crucially, the writer is implying that when we stop blubbing\
  \ like girlies, and dry our eyes, and grasp our Alpenstock in readiness for a healthy\
  \ hike in the mountains to wash all this mawkish drivel out of our heads, the bats\
  \ remain hanging there, upside down within. They do not go away. The lesson is self-evident,\
  \ and is imprinted upon our consciousness, even when we are atop the mountain, panting,\
  \ buffeted by a high freezing wind.\nNote : Extra points will be awarded to those\
  \ who correctly identify the text as a line from Dennis Beerpint's magisterial piece\
  \ Versified Outpourings From The Batcave, recently reissued by Twee Threnodies Ltd.\n\
