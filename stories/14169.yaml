text: "\nAn unseemly number of enquiries arrive at Hooting Yard HQ asking why yesterday's\
  \ postage In Ponga makes reference to the Bishop of Southwark. The answer is simple,\
  \ and is given in the form of an exclusive extract from Mr Key's Shorter Potted\
  \ Brief, Brief Lives, available now from all good bookshops, both actual and virtual.\n\
  Butler, Tom (English bishop, b. 1940). In December 2006, Paul and Nicola Sumpter\
  \ were sitting in a bar near Southwark Cathedral when they heard their car alarm\
  \ go off. Rushing outside, they found a grey-haired man in the back seat of the\
  \ car, throwing the toys of their infant son out of the window. When challenged,\
  \ the man said \u201CI'm the bishop of Southwark. It's what I do\u201D. He then\
  \ got out of the car and disappeared into the night, leaving behind a bag containing,\
  \ among other things, his crucifix.\n[2015-10-29]"
