text: "\u201CIf you are considering dyeing a sheep, first ensure that it is your own\
  \ sheep\u201D.\nA huge debt of gratitude to the Guardian for alerting us to that\
  \ most worrying of modern plagues, the tendency so many people have to dye sheep\
  \ that don't belong to them. Would that Dobson were with us now! In his pamphlet\
  \ How To Dye A Goat (out of print), he hammered home the very same point, or almost\
  \ the same point, attending as he did to the dyeing of goats rather than to the\
  \ dyeing of sheep, over dozens of pages, to such effect that there is not a single\
  \ recorded incident of a person dyeing someone else's goat for the entire period\
  \ that the pamphlet was available in all good goat-related bookshops and/or airport\
  \ terminals.\n[2007-12-03]"
