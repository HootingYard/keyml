text: "My childhood hero, Foofy The Clown, had a very special talent. He was able\
  \ to translate the braying of donkeys. That is, when Foofy overheard the braying\
  \ of a donkey, he could\u2014at the drop of a hat\u2014render it into intelligible\
  \ human speech, and sometimes, it has to be said, into unintelligible human speech.\
  \ Well, let us be honest, more often than not into unintelligible human speech.\
  \ In fact, the more I think about it, casting my mind back across all those shattered\
  \ years to my childhood, I find it hard to recall a single instance of Foofy making\
  \ anything other than unintelligible blatherings whenever he claimed to be translating\
  \ the braying of donkeys. I am racking my brains and searching my memory banks with\
  \ a powerful torch, or even a Klieg light, but to no avail.\nIt is possible that\
  \ I misremember exactly what Foofy the Clown was doing when he was burbling and\
  \ grunting, spittle drooling from his red-painted lips. Or were they painted blue?\
  \ In any case, it may be that he never announced that he was translating the brays\
  \ of donkeys. I could be mixing him up with a different hero of my childhood. And\
  \ in all honesty I do not remember ever seeing Foofy in the company of a donkey.\
  \ I used to see donkeys on the beach at Squalor-on-Sea, and at a farmyard, whereas\
  \ I only ever saw Foofy The Clown when I was taken to the circus, and I was only\
  \ taken to the circus once, because my mother was allergic to trapeze artists and\
  \ sawdust. Her skin came out in blotches and she suffered from debilitating brain\
  \ spasms.\nI think, then, that it must have been my father, home from war in the\
  \ tropics, who took me to the circus that time. I do remember, vividly, that he\
  \ abandoned me there, in the vicinity of bears. My father was forgetful, rather\
  \ than malicious. I think he had witnessed things in the tropics that unhinged him.\
  \ The bears were in a cage, so I was not in immediate peril. It was only when Foofy\
  \ The Clown came skittering along, garish and motley, and grinned at me horribly\
  \ while rattling a bunch of bear-cage keys in my face, that I piddled in my pants\
  \ from terror.\nAnd I ran. I ran and ran, away from the circus until I reached the\
  \ farmyard, and the donkeys. And the donkeys brayed, and I was safe from harm.\n\
