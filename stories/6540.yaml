text: "Today at The Dabbler, my indispensable guide to the Regal Woading, which I\
  \ reproduce here:\n\nBy rights, several dimblebys should be on hand to guide you\
  \ through the events of today's regal woading, but they have been ripp'd untimely\
  \ from their anchorage, so I am stepping into the breach. Let us be joyful.\nBefore\
  \ entering into the state of woaded bliss, the darlings are pulled by elegant horses\
  \ in procession through the streets of the capital. These streets are lined by flag-waving\
  \ peasants and other savages, watched over by coppers with clubs \u201Con the ground\u201D\
  , as they say, and, from high buildings, by snipers armed with high-velocity rifles\
  \ and walkie-talkies. But the mood is rightly joyous. The peasants wave their flags\
  \ and, as the carriages progress, the darlings, yet unwoaded, wave back, though\
  \ flagless. The horses have been equipped with tackle that occludes their peripheral\
  \ vision, to prevent them seeing anything that might make them panic and, in panic,\
  \ go galloping pell mell, crushing peasants beneath their hooves. Were that to happen,\
  \ to continue with the woading would be unseemly, and there must be not a smidgen\
  \ of unseemliness on this day of all days. Hence the horses\u2019 blinkers-tackle.\n\
  Within the huge ensteepled and consecrated edifice await the guests and the shamen.\
  \ None has need of blinkers. The arch-shaman is a fellow with a ragged grey-white\
  \ beard, as is considered proper for his office. He will perform the rite of regal\
  \ woading when the darlings are ushered, separately, into the cavernous interior\
  \ of the edifice. See, there, the trough of woad, and the siphon and funnel and\
  \ besplattering implement which will be used to woad-besplatter the darlings at\
  \ the most significant moment of the ceremony.\nBut first there is much rigmarole,\
  \ of a kind that cries out for interpretation-by-dimbleby. The arch-shaman, or one\
  \ of his acolytes, will ascertain that the woading is pure, unalloyed and sullied\
  \ not by any hint of\_bewolfenbuttlement. In a modern woading such as this, those\
  \ watching electrical transmissions may be able to see each individual grey-white\
  \ hair in the arch-shaman's beard trembling faintly in the cool air. It is a sight\
  \ to behold. The horses remain outwith the edifice, stamping their hooves, being\
  \ fed from nosebags. The peasants and savages too, stay in their pens beside the\
  \ streets, feeding from crisp-packets. The coppers and snipers stay alert.\nInside\
  \ there is solemn blathering and the woading itself, and the darlings buss their\
  \ lips, and a great hosannah of voices is raised in song. Here even a dimbleby might\
  \ pause, to let it sink in, sound and spectacle without comment. Then, blue with\
  \ woad, the darlings emerge, upon the steps, to much cheering and clanging of bells,\
  \ before climbing together into a carriage to be pulled by snack-refreshed horses\
  \ for the return procession. Somewhere in the teeming masses, a \u201Cstudent\u201D\
  \ raises a placard of contempt. Before he can be clubbed by a copper or shot by\
  \ a sniper, he is torn limb from limb by a gaggle of peasants, unnoticed by the\
  \ larger throng. It is meet that it should be so.\nAcross the land, jelly and ice\
  \ cream are gobbled. Huzzah!\n[2011-04-29]"
