  \ 1870). Well worth a read if you are a potatoey person, which I sincerely hope\
  \ you are.\nProf. Blot, by the way, is Pierre Blot (c.1818\u20131874), a man whose\
  \ name I would have had to invent had he not already existed. According to culinary\
  \ historian Jan Longone, \u201CAs far as I can tell, no other nineteenth-century\
  \ cook in America was treated with a comparable level of media hyperbole\u201D.\
  \ Alas, after his death, an article written about him concluded that \u201Che lived\
  \ to see himself neglected and discarded by a capricious public\u201D.\nThe Pierre\
