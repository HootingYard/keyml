text: "Call me a hypochondriac if you will, but I fear I have succumbed to a highly\
  \ dangerous syndrome so baffling to medical science it has not yet been given a\
  \ proper name. Boffins in their underground labs have taken to calling it \u201C\
  bonkers\u201D, for the chief\u2014and so far only\u2014symptom is that victims finds\
  \ themselves agreeing with Peter Hitchens. The terrifying thing is that it can be\
  \ a progressive illness, where at first one nods in perplexity that the columnist's\
  \ words match one's own thoughts, almost anomalously, until towards the end the\
  \ patient has to be carted away, raving. Yesterday I had a definite twitch of the\
  \ early stage condition, when I read this:\nStephen Fry, in an interminable article\
  \ in a London lifestyle magazine, complains that he doesn't like being called a\
  \ \u2018Quintessential Englishman\u2019.\nGlad to hear it. No danger of that happening\
  \ to him here. In this column, he\_ is regarded as a Quintessential Left-wing Luvvie,\
  \ swollen by years of fashionable flattery into absurd prominence.\nI'd also like\
  \ to popularise the description once given of him in The Dictionary Of National\
  \ Celebrity: \u2018A stupid person's idea of what an intelligent person is like.\u2019\
  \nI've been longing to say this since he (an educated man with a duty to take the\
  \ side of the civilisation that sustains him) rallied to the defence of the coarse\
  \ barbarian oaf Jonathan Ross.\n[2009-05-11]"
