text: "Over at Think Of England, Brit has a list of things worthy of disparagement\
  \ (or \u201Cmeh\u201D, as he puts it). It is a fine list, by and large, although\
  \ I was not the only commenter to question his inclusion of \u201Cmost soups\u201D\
  . Obviously the poor fellow is brainsick, at least in that part of the cranium evolution\
  \ has designed for soup appreciation. Perhaps his family and pals can rally round\
  \ and organise an \u201Cintervention\u201D. It may be his only hope.\nHis list,\
  \ however, reminded me of one of my favourite books, The Chatto Book Of Cabbages\
  \ And Kings\_: Lists In Literature, edited by Francis Spufford. Looking it up on\
  \ Amazon to find out if it is still available\u2014it is, of course\u2014I noted\
  \ that, with splendid serendipity, it was published exactly twenty years ago today.\
  \ An anniversary not quite as thrilling as the becrumblement of the Berlin Wall,\
  \ but nevertheless one worth marking. So my thanks to Brit for making me think about\
  \ lists.\nOn the other hand, I have absolutely no idea what has brought Ayn Rand\
  \ swimming into my head over the last few days. I have mentioned her here, and in\
  \ my comment at Think Of England, which might give readers the impression that I\
  \ am somehow obsessed. It is true that I continue to work tirelessly at my monograph\
  \ A Startling Number Of Anagrams Of \u2018Ayn Rand\u2019, which I am hoping to finish\
  \ during the next decade. But other than that, the most interesting thing about\
  \ the bonkers Objectivist is that she was a very keen stamp collector. I drew readers\u2019\
  \ attention to this some years ago, but may as well do so again for those of you\
  \ who do not spend your every waking hour trawling through the Hooting Yard Archives.\
  \ While others may claim The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged as Ayn Rand's greatest\
  \ work, you and I know that she never surpassed her classic Why I Like Stamp Collecting.\n\
