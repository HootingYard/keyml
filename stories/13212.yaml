text: "The Guardian today published a short story by Hilary Mantel entitled The Assassination\
  \ Of Margaret Thatcher. This piece apparently took Ms Mantel thirty years to write,\
  \ for \u201Ctechnical reasons\u201D\u2014\u201CI just couldn't see how to get [the\
  \ characters] to work together\u201D. The inference is that she has at last solved\
  \ the problem, but it seems to me that the characters\u2014an assassin and the woman\
  \ whose flat he uses to set up his sniper's nest\u2014neither work together nor\
  \ individually.\nI have always found Mantel a curiously lifeless writer. The popularity\
  \ of her prize-winning Thomas Cromwell books is a profound mystery, and Beyond Black\
  \ was spectacularly turgid. In the present story she makes full use of her gift\
  \ for clunking, tin-eared dialogue.\nMost amusing is the revelation that the original\
  \ title of the forthcoming collection of stories for which The Assassination of\
  \ Margaret Thatcher acts as a trailer was Ten Transgressive Tales. Ooh! Transgressive!\
  \ What could be less transgressive than an infantile fantasy about murdering a Tory\
  \ prime minister published in the pages of the Guardian?\nFor the next thirty years\
  \ I intend to work on a story entitled The Assassination of Hilary Mantel. The technical\
  \ challenge, to drain all life from my prose, will be huge, but hey!, think how\
  \ transgressive and shocking it will be.\nNOTA BENE\_: For something genuinely transgressive,\
  \ see my forthcoming book Tony Benn Was A Complete Wanker.\n[2014-09-20]"
