text: "\u201CThe antiquarian may take his stand upon Mam-Tor, the mother rock, when\
  \ the moon sheds her silvery light o'er Loosehill Mount, and, carrying his mind\
  \ back into the past some 230 years, hear the bugle's note as it sweeps through\
  \ the Wynnats Pass, and is taken up by the Peverel Castle and transmitted onwards\
  \ through the Vale of Hope, calling the hardy dalesmen to their midnight rendezvous,\
  \ there to be instructed in the science of war, so as to enable them to protect\
  \ their homes and families against the marauding myrmidons of a cruel, heartless,\
  \ and unreliable king; or if the antiquarian seeketh a knowledge of the High Peak\
  \ folk-lore, and feareth neither pixie or graymarie, he can, on a spring night,\
  \ just as the moon has entered her last quarter, and the first note from the belfry\
  \ of the chapel in the frith has proclaimed the arrival of midnight, take his stand\
  \ upon Blentford's Bluff and peer into the dark and sombre depths of Kinder, when\
  \ he will hear the hooting of the barn owl on Anna rocks, the unearthly screech\
  \ of the landrail as he ploughs his way through the unmown grass in search of his\
  \ mate, the scream of the curlew and chatter of the red grouse as they take their\
  \ flight from peak to peak, and see the fairy queen come forth from the mermaid's\
  \ cave in a shimmering light, followed by her maids, who dance a quadrille to the\
  \ music of the spheres, and hear the wild blast of the hunter's horn heralding the\
  \ approach of the Gabriel hounds as they take their rapid course across the murky\
  \ sky, and become lost in the unfathomable depths beyond the Scout.\u201D\nRobert\
  \ Ottiwell Gifford-Bennet, M.D., Senior Acting Physician To The Devonshire Hospital\
