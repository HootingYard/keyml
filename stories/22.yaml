text: "Today I am wearing the Socks of Pepintude, and so attired I shall stride forth\
  \ decisively. There is of course a risk that curs will snuffle at my socks, and\
  \ kittens too, possibly, for the Socks of Pepintude emit odours which convulsively\
  \ befuddle our four-footed friends, though they remain undetectable by the human\
  \ nose. Or so I have been told by my spy at the lab, who keeps me up to date on\
  \ such matters. It is best to wear a pair of tough Uruguayan Air Force boots over\
  \ the Socks of Pepintude. This will go some way to deter curs, and kittens, and\
  \ thus one's decisive progress through the boulevards meets with less travail.\n\
  You may ask where I am going, so decisively, through the boulevards of this important\
  \ town. I am going to the post office. Alas, unlike the post office in Plovdiv it\
  \ is not emblazoned with a mural painted by the Plovdiv Fivesome, but none the less\
  \ it is a very fine post office. Outside it on the esplanade is a flagpole with\
  \ a big blue flag flying atop it. The doors are made of some weird iridescent metal\
  \ and swoosh open as one approaches. Having thrown off any trailing curs and kittens\
  \ I am going to cause those doors to swoosh and I shall make my decisive strides\
  \ into the post office lobby, where a cadet in a cadet's cap and tunic will point\
  \ me towards a queue leading to a counter behind which I know in the innermost fibres\
  \ of my being there will be a tally-stick person ready to sell me some postage-related\
  \ items.\nWhen the exchange has been made, I will exit again through the swooshing\
  \ doors, having saluted the cadet, and I shall stride decisively into the esplanade,\
  \ and gaze at the flag atop the flagpole, and I shall not flinch.\nSource\_: Forty\
