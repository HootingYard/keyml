text: "Here are a few useful things I learned while reading Buchanan's Journal Of\
  \ Man, Volume 1 Number 4, published in May 1887:\n\u201CPianos have lately been\
  \ made from paper in Germany, instead of wood, with great improvement in the tone.\u201D\
  \n\u201CThere is no denying that the young man about town of the nineteenth century\
  \ is a blot upon our boasted modern civilization. His is not a pleasant figure to\
  \ contemplate, though it is one that we all see very often and know very well\u2014\
  clothed irreproachably in the most expensive raiment that London tailors and unlimited\
  \ credit can supply. He lives lazily and luxuriously on his father's money and his\
  \ wife's, and, being after his natural term of days laid away in a tomb at Mt. Auburn,\
  \ ends his existence without making any more impression upon the world's history\
  \ than a falling rose leaf, or an August cricket's faintest chirp.\u201D\n\u201C\
  In 1885 we were informed of the success of spirits at Cleveland, Ohio, in communicating\
  \ messages by the telegraphic method in rapping, in which our millionaire friend,\
  \ Mr. J. H. Wade, has taken much interest. A little apparatus has been constructed,\
  \ with which the spirits give their communications in great variety. I have repeatedly\
  \ stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have always\
  \ proved in my experience more reliable than those of the living. This has been\
  \ verified at Cleveland. The late Dr. Wells of Brooklyn has been giving diagnoses\
  \ and prescriptions through the telegraph.\u201D\nI think we can agree with the\
  \ correspondent of the Vineland Rostrum, who said of the Journal's editor J R Buchanan\
  \ \u201CWe never read an article from the pen of this world-renowned thinker, but\
  \ that we feel we are in the presence of one whose shoes\u2019 latchet we are unworthy\
  \ to unloose\u201D.\nMany thanks to Odd Ends.\n[2008-08-17]"
