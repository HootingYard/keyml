text: 'Until yesterday, the snows of yesteryear were being kept in bins in a remote
  and refrigerated storage facility. Due to a security alert, however, the bins were
  moved during the night. A fleet of trucks ferried the snow, in the bins, to a secret
  location. The trucks were refrigerated as, too, we must assume, is the secret location.
  Because it is secret, I cannot tell you where it is. I don''t even know myself.
  But what this means is that we cannot answer the question, where are the snows of
  yesteryear?

  Obviously we can answer that they are in a secret, refrigerated, location, but that
  is hardly satisfactory. The more persistent reporters from the winter weather phenomena
  press are unlikely to return to their igloo offices only to face the wrath of their
  white-bearded, icicle-strewn editors. No, they will think up ever more cunning ways
  to phrase their questions, hoping to trip up the snow authorities.

  The snows of yesteryear, where are they?, they might ask, or Yesteryear, the snows
  of, whatever happened to them? Sooner or later a dimwit on the panel will blurt
  out the precise coordinates of the secret location, and frenzy will ensue.

  Snow frenzy is akin to snow fury, and we are reminded of the bestselling paperback
  Like A Woman Scorn''d by Ella Snowfury. It was in fact by Pebblehead, writing under
  a pseudonym. There is a rogue edition purporting to be by Ella Thnowfury, copies
  of which have fetched sums as high as 15 New Pence on eBay.
