text: "Yesterday's piece entitled Tungsten Grebe contained an unfortunate error which\
  \ rendered it incomprehensible. As a consequence, the Hooting Yard Incoming Postage\
  \ Logistics Silo was bombarded with untold thousands of letters from readers expressing\
  \ bafflement, befuddlement, or, in some cases, utter indifference.\nI have now taken\
  \ the opportunity to reread, rereread, and rerereread the text, scan it through\
  \ a Bl\xF6tzmannscope, subject it to the Pigwell-Faffington Test, and carry out\
  \ several other procedures that you need not bother your ungainly little heads about.\n\
  As a result of my labours, which I can assure you were Herculean, I am now able\
  \ to announce that if you replace the words \u201Ctungsten grebe\u201D with \u201C\
  zinc egret\u201D, all becomes clear. Well, if not exactly clear, then let us say\
  \ less misty.\n[2013-04-19]"
