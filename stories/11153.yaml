text: "Readers will be familiar with the plucky fascist tot Tiny Enid, but I have\
  \ only recently learned of the existence of her cousin and sometime playmate, Eerie\
  \ Mavis.\n\nEerie Mavis spent much of her time loitering in a barn, mucking about\
  \ with lengths of string and rotting fruit and pliers. She is said to have had an\
  \ affinity with jackdaws, though it is not clear how this manifested itself. Eerie\
  \ she may have been, but she did not have the power of flight, and her speaking\
  \ voice was more akin to the mutter than the caw. Indeed, one of the eeriest things\
  \ about Eerie Mavis was her constant, incomprehensible, and somehow menacing muttering,\
  \ which began as soon as she woke from sleep on her straw pallet in the barn, and\
  \ continued all bloody day until, in eventual exhaustion, she flung herself back\
  \ on the pallet, and the Land of Nod. Even then, she was known to mutter in her\
  \ sleep.\nYou could trust Eerie Mavis with a box of matches. She showed no signs\
  \ of pyromania, and indeed could be counted on to douse any conflagrations which\
  \ may erupt in the farmyard. She never seemed to be far from a spigot, and showed\
  \ both delicacy and determination when handling a hosepipe.\nShe was not a musical\
  \ tot\u2014the eternal muttering put paid to any ambitions she may have had as a\
  \ songstress\u2014but could be spellbound by the sound of electric guitars played\
  \ in the screeching heavy metal style, and also by the softer toots of the piccolo.\
  \ When so spellbound, she would drop her string and fruit and pliers, and stand\
  \ stock still, close by a spigot, in her slightly lopsided way, and shut her eyes,\
  \ and levitate, an inch or so off the ground. Her muttering did not entirely cease\
  \ at such times, but it became quieter.\nHer slight lopsidedness had no apparent\
  \ physical cause. She did not, unlike her cousin Tiny Enid, have a club foot, and\
  \ wore no corrective boot. Passing farmyard adults would occasionally try to straighten\
  \ her up, by means of gentle coaxing, to no avail. In a tape recorded interview,\
  \ conducted decades later when she had become a crone, Eerie Mavis revealed that\
  \ she had always stood bolt upright, and it was the farmyard itself that was lopsided.\
  \ Alas, it had by then long been covered by concrete, and no land surveyor could\
  \ attest to the truth of her claim.\nA double biography of Eerie Mavis and Tiny\
  \ Enid is long overdue. There is one in the works, from the pen of Pebblehead, but\
  \ many obstacles lie in his path, not least the fact that each time he completes\
  \ a page, no sooner has it rolled off his typewriter than it is snatched and borne\
  \ away in the beak of a jackdaw, up into the blue Alpine skies, irretrievable, irretrievable,\
  \ lost, lost, lost.\n[2013-03-17]"
