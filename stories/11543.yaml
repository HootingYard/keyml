text: "I am reading A Double Life, Sarah Burton's 2003 biography of Charles and Mary\
  \ Lamb, and have been delighted by a couple of names mentioned therein.\nOne of\
  \ the Lamb's relatives lived in a Hertfordshire cottage called, splendidly, Button\
  \ Snap. It is still there, a listed building, so I may have to go and violently\
  \ drive out the current tenants or owners and move in myself.\nGone, however, is\
  \ a pub at 17 Newgate Street in the City of London called The Salutation And Cat,\
  \ where Charles Lamb used to get squiffy with his pal Samuel Taylor Coleridge. According\
  \ to Walter Thornbury in Old And New London (1878), the pub was named after an \u201C\
  odd combination of two incongruous signs\u201D. Over the road was another pub with\
  \ the equally intriguing name of The Magpie And Stump.\nBoth Sarah Burton and Walter\
  \ Thornbury remind us of Coleridge's youthful folly in enlisting in the army. He\
  \ did so under the pseudonym Silas Tompkin Comberbache. Some years ago I linked\
  \ to a site (now vanished*) which contained this brief reference to his military\
  \ service:\nAs a rider, his attempts ended frequently in disaster: \u201CWithin\
  \ this week I have been thrown three times from my Horse, and run away with to no\
  \ small perturbation of my nervous system.\u201D He developed saddle sores, \u201C\
  dreadfully troublesome eruptions, which so grimly constellated my Posteriors.\u201D\
  \n\nButton Snap\n*ADDENDUM : Not so. There is a (revised) link to the site in the\
  \ comments. Thanks to Dave Lull and others who pointed out my error.\n[2013-06-04]"
