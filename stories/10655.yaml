text: "\u201CThe best-laid schemes o\u2019 mice an\u2019 men / Gang aft agley\u201D\
  \ wrote Robert Burns. How right he was, in a very real sense, as they say on Thought\
  \ For The Day. Certainly here at Hooting Yard a scheme is about to gang very agley\
  \ indeed.\nAs you know, this year I set myself the task of bashing out roughly a\
  \ thousand words a day. Here we are in mid-November and I have astonished myself\
  \ by very nearly succeeding. Quite honestly, I thought the scheme would collapse\
  \ in ignominy some time in January. And while it is true that I have occasionally,\
  \ on days o\u2019 emptiness-between-the-ears, posted pieces resurrected from the\
  \ past, I have done so rarely. For the most part, 2012 has seen a teeming cascade\
  \ of words, every single syllable worthy of your rapt attention.\nSo many words,\
  \ indeed, that I was able to compile a fat 444-page paperback of pieces selected\
  \ from the first half of the year. If you have not yet bought a copy of Brute Beauty\
  \ And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle! then you bloody well ought\
  \ to. You will want to have read it from cover to cover, and reread it, and made\
  \ scholarly annotations in the margins, and rereread it, before a further volume,\
  \ selected from the second half of the year, appears in, I hope, the spring of 2013.\n\
  What then, you may ask, has gang agley? Well, imminently, Mr Key will be leaving\
  \ his Barrel of Reclusion for a short while to travel in foreign climes. I shall\
  \ be gone for more than a week but less than a fortnight. During this time it will\
  \ be simply impractical to splurge forth daily prose for your edification and moral\
  \ instruction. Thus there will be a hiatus.\nI considered two possible fixes. One\
  \ was to write sufficient pieces in advance and schedule them for posting while\
  \ I am away. I am afraid the extra effort was beyond my wit. The second was to schedule\
  \ selected repostages from the archive to cover the period. But this seemed to me\
  \ something of a cop-out. Better, I decided, to allow the scheme, in all its glory,\
  \ to contain a fatal flaw.\nSo I will be back soon, and in the meantime there may\
  \ appear bittybobs of bloggy blather, albeit of far fewer than a thousand words,\
  \ so keep your eyes peeled.\n[2012-11-16]"
