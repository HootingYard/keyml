text: "One two three four five six seven. All good children go to heaven.\n  Eight\
  \ nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. That won't be the fate of Lothar Preen.\nThis\
  \ pretty little rhyme was devised by the maestro himself, Lothar Preen, he of the\
  \ majestic bouffant, flailing baton, psychopathic personality disorder, and criminal\
  \ associations in the dockyard taverns of the Marseilles underworld. One can see\
  \ here Preen the self-mythologiser, relishing his seemingly inevitable descent into\
  \ the bowels of hell. There will be no heaven for him.\nWe do not of course know\
  \ what became of Lothar Preen after death, save that his corpse was eaten by worms.\
  \ So great had his legend grown that his grave, in the pretty little churchyard\
  \ at St Bibblybibdib's, was dug up, a few months after he had been buried, just\
  \ to make sure he was actually dead and gone. That is when they saw the worms, gobbling\
  \ up what was left of the maestro, by the light of their tarry torches on a foul\
  \ October night. The churchyard did not look so pretty then.\nSome said that is\
  \ how he would be remembered, as supper for worms\u2014the worms that had even gnawed\
  \ through his conductor's baton, which was buried with him, alongside his favourite\
  \ tea-strainer and oodles upon oodles of unpaid bills. But of course that is not\
  \ why we remember Lothar Preen today. We remember him for the magnificent recordings\
  \ of The Phlogiston Variations, of Clamp's Fifth, of The Pretty Little Tea-Strainers\
  \ song cycle. We remember him, too, for the incident in a Marseilles dockyard tavern\
  \ when he stabbed a rival maestro in the eye, as if he were Marlowe, and for the\
  \ many many wells he poisoned, and for feeding that cellist into a sausage mincer.\
  \ He was never convicted of any of these crimes, for it was said he committed them\
  \ when the balance of his mind was disturbed, when he was unhinged. But quite frankly,\
  \ was he ever hinged, from the moment he first became conscious, in the pretty little\
  \ convent hospital of St Spivack's, as his mother lay dying?\nHis childhood alone\
  \ is a tale of unhingements, best avoided by those without strong stomachs. For\
  \ every example of precocious musical genius, there are twenty or thirty murders,\
  \ stabbings, slicings, loppings, poisonings, stranglings, and other gruesome and\
  \ grisly doings. Few people have been able to read his memoir, A Childhood Of Precocious\
  \ Musical Genius And Murderous Psychotic Unhingement, without keeping a bucket beside\
  \ them in which to vomit.\nVomit, indeed, seems to have played an important part\
  \ in the life of the adult Preen, if we are to believe his accounts of riotous carousing\
  \ in the more insalubrious taverns down at the Marseilles docks. It was in such\
  \ squalor the maestro would hold court, his bouffant a thing of blinding grandeur.\
  \ When he was not stabbing rival maestri in the eyes, he was jabbing at them verbally,\
  \ taunting them with his superior baton flailing technique, or simply waiting for\
  \ them to keel over drunk before giving them a good kicking in the head. It is part\
  \ of the legend that at no time did he ever pay for a single drink during these\
  \ nights of high debauch.\nHis finances, or lack of them, were always a mystery,\
  \ and in the years since his death various lawyers and accountants have been kept\
  \ busy untangling the chaos he left behind. There are claims that Preen's Byzantine\
  \ wheeler-dealings are at the root of the world's current financial meltdown. That\
  \ one man could be responsible for the global chaos seems on the face of it absurd,\
  \ until we pause to consider that the man was Lothar Preen. Of what was he not capable?\n\
  This is a man, remember, who quite apart from all the murders and stabbings and\
  \ slicings and loppings and poisonings and stranglings and other grim and grisly\
  \ doings, was capable, in what we might call his more humane moments, of gathering\
  \ together thousands of pretty little birds\u2014siskins and linnets and wrens and\
  \ hummingbirds and jackdaws\u2014and training them to sing the long, complex, and\
  \ breathtakingly beautiful choruses from Prog's comic opera based on the life of\
  \ Charles Hawtrey (1914\u20131988). That the maestro devised his own grand finale,\
  \ in which the birds are savaged by cats and then electrocuted one by one, we may\
  \ deplore yet recognise as a characteristic and ineffable Preenian touch.\n\u201C\
  Preenian\u201D, \u201CPreenesque\u201D, \u201CPreenish\u201D. It is a mark of his\
  \ genius, perhaps, that none of these words has entered the vocabulary. In the last\
  \ analysis\u2014actually, in the first analysis\u2014he was simply unique. Did those\
  \ worms beneath the soil in the pretty little churchyard of St Bibblybibdib's know\
  \ how fortunate they were, to be gnawing and munching the rotting remains of the\
  \ great maestro? One bit of him, of course, they did not get to eat, and that was\
  \ the bouffant, which was removed from his head before burial, and placed in a preserving\
  \ jar. It has had its own adventures. Initially sold at auction in order to settle\
  \ at least one of the debts he left unpaid, the bouffant-in-a-jar was stolen from\
  \ its (anonymous) purchaser, who was found, the morning after the sale, chopped\
  \ into a thousand pieces. It was next seen adorning the beer-stained counter of\
  \ a tavern in a particularly sordid Marseilles tavern, but disappeared after a knife-fight\
  \ among thugs. A year or so later, it turned up next to a waste bin on a pretty\
  \ little towpath next to an unimportant canal. The bouffant, in its jar, is currently\
  \ thought to be under lock and key in a bank vault, though by all accounts it is\
  \ the kind of vault, and the kind of bank, favoured by criminal gangs planning heists\
  \ which can later be immortalised on screen.\nLothar Preen himself has never been\
  \ depicted in a film. No cinema would dare to show it.\nFourteen fifteen sixteen\
  \ seventeen. I am the maestro Lothar Preen.\n  Eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one.\
  \ When I am gone they will blot out the sun.\nAnd they did. It is still pitch dark.\n\
