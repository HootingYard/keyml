text: 'Banished to a remote atoll, I subsisted on molluscs and rainwater. It was my
  own fault. I had been issued with one of the new-style Anti-Social Behaviour Orders.
  Now I would have many long years to reflect upon the consequences of brazenly smoking
  a cigarette at a bus stop, past which an endless parade of vehicles belched noxious
  fumes. It was, as they say, a fair cop, guv. I readily placed my wrists into the
  manacles presented by the Community Patrol Invigilation Cadet as I lay sprawled
  in the gutter following a salutary Tasering. My week in a befouled hulk anchored
  off the seaside was an enormous help. I was able for the first time to acknowledge
  the depth of my criminality. I can say, without dissembling, that I positively enjoyed
  the sensation of being tossed out of an aeroplane and descending, with the aid of
  an automatically-opening parachute, which I have since ripped up for bedding linen,
  onto my atoll. For it is, now, very much my atoll, where I subsist upon molluscs
  and rainwater, and my rapidly dwindling carton of untipped full strength Paraguayan
  cigarettes.
