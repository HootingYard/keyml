text: "Deckhand With Mop is a large nautical portrait, done in emulsion, by the Royal\
  \ Academician Chamfer Ticktape. Apart from the vast swathes of brightly-coloured\
  \ emulsion with which it was executed, the notable feature of the painting is the\
  \ hideous countenance of the deckhand\u2014a countenance so hideous that none can\
  \ look upon it without, in an instant, becoming gibberingly insane. In this respect,\
  \ the painting is akin to some fatuous melodramatic incident in a story by H P Lovecraft.\
  \ Yet the effect of that hideous deckhand's countenance is, regrettably, all too\
  \ real, as a brief visit to the locked ward of the grim bleak windswept granite\
  \ asylum, perched on the hillside, makes clear. There one will find, gibbering and\
  \ insane, a gaggle of art critics and newspaper hacks who were present at the painting's\
  \ unveiling.\nBut what of Chamfer Ticktape himself? How did he paint, in swathes\
  \ of brightly-coloured emulsion, the hideous countenance of the deckhand, without\
  \ himself succumbing to gibbering, and to insanity? For years, the noted Royal Academician\
  \ has refused to speak of his painting, referring all enquiries to his PR toady,\
  \ a master of obfuscatory fol-de-rol. At various times, this slippery fellow has\
  \ hinted either that the artist was blindfolded as he painted, or that his brain\
  \ was protected by a mysterious carapace, or that he prepared a \u201Cpainting-by-numbers\u201D\
  \ grid and directed the execution from behind a screen, his assistants then being\
  \ carted off one by one to the very same grim bleak windswept granite asylum, perched\
  \ on the hillside, where they are kept in a separate wing, also locked, in which\
  \ they gibber insanely while sucking on wafers. Not one of these tales is likely\
  \ to be true. Some say the deckhand is a self-portrait of the painter, but how could\
  \ that be? Chamfer Ticktape is a man-about-town, sweeping in and out of fashionable\
  \ restaurants and nightspots, in cape and muffler, pursued by paparazzi, and he\
  \ does not leave in his wake a trail of the gibbering and insane.\nMy own theory\
  \ is that, when viewing this gigantic painting, done in emulsion, one must keep\
  \ one's eyes fixed steadily on the mop, the mop, the mop!\n[2011-02-14]"
