text: 'The Times Archive Blog tells us about the food at a party thrown by the Princess
  Royal in 1789:

  That part of the Supper which was hot consisted of twenty tureens of different Soups,
  Roast Ducks, Turkey, Poultry, Cygnets, Green Geese, Land Rails, Chickens, Asparagus,
  Peas and Beans. The cold parts of the collation were the same kind of Poultry boned,
  and swimming or standing in the centre of transparent jellies, where they were supported
  by paste pillars not in circumference thicker than a knitting needle. This, with
  the lights playing from the candles and reflected on by the polish of the plates
  and dishes made a most beautiful appearance. Crayfish pies of all kinds were distributed
  with great taste, and the Hams and Brawn in Masquerade swimming on the surface of
  pedestals of jelly, seemingly supported but by the strength of an apparent liquid
  called for admiration.

  De Quincey''s lieutenant-colonel might have lived had he developed a taste for Hams
  and Brawn in Masquerade instead of those abominable muffins.
