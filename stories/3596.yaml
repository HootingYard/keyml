text: "\u201CIt may take a long time, but my fame will outshine that of Victor Hugo\
  \ or Napoleon. Wagner died twenty-five years too soon to know his day of glory.\
  \ I hope to live long enough to see mine\u2026 There lies within me a latent glory\
  \ of immense force, like that of a shell which has yet to burst\u2026 The light\
  \ of this glory will fall upon all my works without exception, it will illuminate\
  \ every action of my life; people will avidly dig up information about my childhood\
  \ and marvel at the way I played prisoner's base\u2026 Some people are predestined!\
  \ Then, as the poet says, one feels the brand on one's brow\u2026 The star one bears\
  \ resplendent\u2026 I shall never forget it.\u201D\u2014Raymond Roussel\nMainly\
  \ dry, with sunny or clear periods and very cold. A few light snow showers are possible,\
  \ especially across eastern parts, but any accumulations of snow will be small.\
  \ On the whole tonight will be dry and frosty. Aminadab! Aminadab! Burn the pastille,\
  \ Aminadab! Starting with a widespread frost, and ice on untreated surfaces. Most\
  \ places will have a very cold and dry day with sunny spells, but isolated light\
  \ wintry showers may arrive. Here comes Jimmy Lickspittle, see him far away. See\
  \ Jimmy Lickspittle, fallen in the gutter. Another dry but cold day is expected\
  \ with some sunny spells especially during the afternoon. Light northwest winds.\
  \ The pier, the shearers, the pier, the greater infortune, the lesser infortune,\
  \ the connecting door, the pier, the pier, the blaze of noon. Another dry but cold\
  \ day is expected with some sunny spells developing during the afternoon. Light\
  \ northwest winds. Isolated light snow showers will arrive. Each night sharp overnight\
  \ frosts will occur. I know, indeed, that all around me is wonderful\u2026 a dark\
  \ veil, with the foolish words, NATURE OF THINGS, upon it, casts its deadening folds\
  \ between me and their dazzling strangeness. Flowers open, and stars rise, and it\
  \ seems to me they could have done no less. The middle of next week and into next\
  \ weekend will continue very cold with widespread frosts. The frost will be severe\
  \ in places and perhaps extreme in some rural spots. Patchy freezing fog is also\
  \ likely to form, which will be slow to clear and may linger all day in a few parts.\
  \ The mystery of distant mountain-blue only makes me reflect that the earth is of\
  \ necessity mountainous; the sea-wave breaks at my feet, and I do not see how it\
  \ should have remained unbroken. But one object there is still, which I never pass\
  \ without the renewed wonder of childhood, and that is the bow of a Boat. Many western\
  \ and southern parts will be mainly dry with some good sunny spells, although occasional\
  \ sleet or snow showers are also possible. More frequent and heavier snow showers\
  \ are likely in the north and east where further significant snowfall is likely.\
  \ The further outlook will continue cold with further widespread frosts. However,\
  \ it will probably not be as cold as the previous week, with perhaps fewer wintry\
  \ showers. The stars will turn in their courses. The planets will spin. Jimmy Lickspittle\
  \ will lie in the gutter, by the pier, at the harbour, in Britain.\n[2010-01-01]"
