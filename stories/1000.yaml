text: "In Diaries Of The Dead, I mentioned that George Orwell's diaries are being\
  \ posted online as a daily blog. They are magnificent, in a quite unexpected way.\
  \ Here are some\u2014unedited\u2014entries for seventy years ago:\n16.11.38 One\
  \ egg.\n17.11.38 One egg.\n19.11.38 Two eggs.\n21.11.38 Two eggs.\n22.11.38 Two\
  \ eggs.\n25.11.38 Two eggs.\n27.11.38 One egg.\n28.11.38 Two eggs.\nClearly, Orwell's\
  \ diary would have been the most terrifying book Alfred Hitchcock could imagine.\n\
  I am also reminded that I once bought a picture postcard in Prague which included\
  \ a quotation from \u201CThe Dairies Of Franz Kafka\u201D.\nEXCITING UPDATE!\_:\
  \ 29.11.38 One egg.\n[2008-11-28]"
