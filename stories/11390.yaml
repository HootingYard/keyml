text: "Hooba Nooba Hoo! Bent Cronje!\n  He forded the Ack and he slew our foes!\n\
  \  He lopped off their heads and stuck them on spikes!\n  With his bevelled sword\
  \ he slew and slew!\n  Now we carry his bones to their resting-place\n  In the palace\
  \ on the hill under a cloud of crows!\n  But the mighty Bent Cronje will never die!\n\
  \  He is reborn daily as a bird!\nThis is a translation\u2014and not a very good\
  \ one\u2014of the so-called Bent Cronje Song, commemorating Bent Cronje, the ancient\
  \ hero who saved the town of Scroonhoonpooge from attack by the forces of Git, the\
  \ \u201CKing-across-the-Ack\u201D. Its chief interest, for historians, is the mention\
  \ of the palace on the hill. Where in the name of heaven was this palace? There\
  \ are no hills anywhere near Scroonhoonpooge. The land thereabouts is flat for as\
  \ far as the eye can see, and indeed much of it is boggy and marshy and empuddled.\n\
  If the site could be located, it would be possible to have a dig, with spades, to\
  \ see if there are any bones buried there. The presence of bones would not necessarily\
  \ prove the historical existence of Bent Cronje himself, of course, but it would\
  \ give scholars something to mull over. As things stand, all we know of Bent Cronje\
  \ is his song and a shield\u2014much battered and dented and rusty\u2014kept in\
  \ a glass case in the vestibule of Scroonhoonpooge Almshouse. It is said, according\
  \ to the hand-written card stuck next to it, to be Bent Cronje's shield, which he\
  \ carried with him as he forded the Ack and lopped the heads off Git's army. The\
  \ provenance of the adjacent piece of cardboard is dubious, with some claiming it\
  \ only appeared in the glass case last Thursday. If that is true, Bent Cronje's\
  \ shield might be any old scrap of battered and dented and rusty metal dug out of\
  \ a pit somewhere in the vicinity. It might not even be a shield.\nWhereas the historians\
  \ are stymied until such time as they can find the location of the palace, not so\
  \ the ornithologists. Unsurprisingly, quite a number of bird experts get in a flap\
  \ about the idea that Bent Cronje is \u201Creborn daily\u201D as a bird. There are\
  \ competing theories. One strand of thought is that the soul or essence of Bent\
  \ Cronje is present in a new hatchling every day, implying that over the centuries\
  \ untold thousands of birds have actually been Bent Cronje simultaneously. Against\
  \ this, some argue that there is but a single soul or essence which somehow flits\
  \ from bird to bird by a process we puny humans cannot hope to comprehend.\nThere\
  \ was a fad, a few years ago, for Bent Cronje bird seances. A bird would be trapped\
  \ and encaged and brought to a darkened room and the cage placed in the centre of\
  \ a round table, Various spiritually-minded ornithologists would be seated around\
  \ the table, and they would attempt to elicit from the bird some indication that\
  \ it was the living embodiment, for that day at least, of the legendary hero. The\
  \ process usually involved rapping noises, sudden chills in the room temperature,\
  \ and the spewing of ectoplasm. No definitive Bent Cronje bird was ever identified,\
  \ which is hardly surprising when one considers the foolishness of such behaviour.\n\
  My own view is that someone ought to study very carefully that translation of the\
  \ song. I suspect it is woefully inaccurate, and that the words Bent and Cronje\
  \ and Ack and foes and lopped and heads and stuck and spikes and bevelled and sword\
  \ and slew and bones and resting-place and palace and hill and crows and reborn\
  \ and daily and bird are all wrong. It would be immeasurably helpful if we knew\
  \ from what language it has been translated.\n[2013-05-08]"
