text: "Some months ago we turned our attention to the modern pig, and I am pleased\
  \ to post this letter received from Outa_Spaceman in which he recalls his very own\
  \ modern pig experience:\nMany years ago one of my \u2018in-between-jobs\u2019 was\
  \ as a security guard. I had to look after a \u2018pig trap\u2019. It looked like\
  \ a bungalow-sized oil refinery, all red painted pipes, valves and exciting gauges.\
  \ It was positioned in a small village called Lofthouse at the top of Nidderdale.\n\
  The \u2018intelligent\u2019 pig (iPig?) had been inserted at Billingham and trundled\
  \ down the pipeline inspecting and cleaning as it went. Boffins monitored its progress,\
  \ via in-built T.V. cameras, in a portakabin alongside the pig trap. My job was\
  \ to make sure no yokels attempted to interfere with the installation, as the pipeline\
  \ carried a highly explosive pressurised gas (methane I think).\nAt the end of my\
  \ night-long vigil I decided to stay and wait for the pig to arrive and watch the\
  \ trap being \u2018blown\u2019. Frantic boffin activity, lots of valve opening and\
  \ closing, the pig arrived in the trap and the methane burnt off. It created the\
  \ biggest sheet of flame I've ever seen and, even though I was a good way off, singed\
  \ my eyebrows. After tests and recalibration the pig was reinserted and sent off\
  \ toward Stanlow.\nFor me the most amazing fact is that there's a pipeline that\
  \ connects one side of the country to the other via the Pennines.\n[2010-08-20]"
