text: "Janitor, janitor, where is your mop?\n  Janitor, janitor, where is your mop?\n\
  \  Janitor, janitor, where is your mop?\n  For Christ's sake, let the question drop!\n\
  Janitor, janitor, where is your pail?\n  You have no pail and you have no mop.\n\
  \  You have no bucket, you have no keys.\n  Oh please please let this matter drop!\n\
  These are the first two verses of Janitor, Janitor, one of the songs collected in\
  \ the new compendium Four Hundred And Forty-Four Songs About Janitors And Janissaries,\
  \ edited by Dennis Beerpint. It is a work of majestic scholarship, and Beerpint\
  \ is to be congratulated for the depth of his scholarship, the rigour of his method,\
  \ the pernicketyness of his annotations, the suavity of his commentary, the glamour\
  \ of his bouffant, the schmaltz of his windpipery, the electrocution of his swan,\
  \ the guzzling of his wren pie, the redundancy of his courage, the consistency of\
  \ his porridge, and the tess of his durbevilles. What he is most certainly not to\
  \ be congratulated for is that creaking malignant awful dehydrated boney boney trapeze\
  \ artiste air he simultaneously exudes and muffles, muffles and exudes, all spat-out\
  \ fruit-pips and prisoner's dilemma, a mole in the headlights of a tractor, a tractor\
  \ in a field, a field in Merrie England where rustics cavort around a maypole before\
  \ slumping exhausted on to bales of hay and straw, picking gorse and bracken out\
  \ of their hair, while in the blue blue skies above, dirigibles loom like so many\
  \ gas-filled balloons above the verdant splendour.\nIt is a verdant splendour many\
  \ of the janitors in this magnificent anthology would do well to revisit, could\
  \ they but drag themselves away for five minutes from their interminable corridors,\
  \ punctuated by cupboards, where keys are rattled, and buckets and pails and mops\
  \ are mislaid, and there is terrible weeping in the dark hours before the dawn.\n\
