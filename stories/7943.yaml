text: "I greatly admire those who devote time and energy to the study of extremely\
  \ arcane, obscure, or specialised subjects. Such as Robert Killick-Kendrick, whose\
  \ obituary appears in today's Grauniad. Though he was \u201Ca man of many interests,\
  \ which included guitar playing, choral singing, hiking and photographing the numerous\
  \ butterflies that visited his garden\u201D- and possibly sharing his wife's major\
  \ preoccupation (she is \u201Can expert on sand flies\u201D)\u2014our hero is particularly\
  \ to be acclaimed for this:\nHe also made a study of domestic animals\u2019 bells,\
  \ ranging from elephants in India to hunting dogs in southern France, which resulted\
  \ in a scholarly, but sadly uncompleted book, illustrated mainly with his own photographs.\n\
  Incidentally, elsewhere in the Grauniad today, in the Weekend magazine, there is\
  \ a photograph of what must surely be the most coveted Christmas gift of the year\u2014\
  of any year!\u2014an Alain De Botton action figure. Curiously, there is no trace\
  \ of the photo, nor indeed of the accompanying article, on the website.\n[2011-12-24]"
