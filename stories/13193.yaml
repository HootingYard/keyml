text: "Toots clattered up to the post office counter, sore perplexed.\n\u201CHello\
  \ Toots, what can I do for you today?\u201D said the friendly postmaster.\n\u201C\
  I am sore perplexed,\u201D said Toots, \u201CI have lost my Maytals.\u201D\nThe\
  \ postmaster was hard of hearing, and had been ever since a traumatic childhood\
  \ incident when he was inadvertently placed in too close proximity to a klaxon for\
  \ the duration of a lengthy Communist Party rally.\n\u201CIf you have lost your\
  \ marbles, Toots, you'll be wanting a psychiatrist, not the postal service.\u201D\
  \nToots repeated himself, louder, and with exaggeratedly precise movements of his\
  \ lips.\n\u201COh I see,\u201D said the postmaster, \u201CBut what makes you think\
  \ I can be of any assistance?\u201D\nToots went on to explain his belief that the\
  \ postal service, engaged as it was in the great work of sending and delivering\
  \ sundry items all around the world, was the obvious agency to consult if one wished\
  \ to track down something lost, in this case his Maytals. The postmaster took his\
  \ point, with certain reservations which he kept to himself.\n\u201CI will keep\
  \ a lookout for them, Toots,\u201D he said.\nToots, whose sore perplexity was now\
  \ etched deeper than ever upon his countenance, was dissatisfied with this response.\n\
  \u201CAre you not able to do something more than that?\u201D he screeched, alarming,\
  \ in the queue behind him, several persons among whom was a skivvy from the Big\
  \ House up on the hill. The postmaster asked, not unreasonably, what Toots would\
  \ have him do.\n\u201CSome kind of tracking,\u201D said Toots, \u201CWith post office\
  \ dogs, bloodhounds, tracking, or tagging, the sending of telegrams or telegraphs,\
  \ uniformed post office runners, I don't know, notices slapped up in post offices\
  \ across the land, vans scouring the countryside, the full weight of the postal\
  \ service thrown behind the search \u2026 \u201C\n\u201CLet me stop you there,\u201D\
  \ said the postmaster, \u201CWhile I serve this skivvy from the Big House.\u201D\
  \nToots slumped in a corner of the post office, woebegone and weeping. The skivvy\
  \ bought a single postage stamp, plopped it into a pocket of her apron, and trudged\
  \ out and along the street past the haberdashery and the butcher's and the fairy\
  \ grotto, over the bridge across the canal and along the lane through the spinney\
  \ up the hill to the gaunt iron gates of the Big House, along the path by the turnip\
  \ beds and the stone statues of daredevil wartime aeroplane pilots, across the lawn\
  \ and down the alley along the side of the house, in through a door tucked almost\
  \ imperceptibly in a porch, down a flight of stairs into a gloomy corridor, until\
  \ she reached the door of her scullery. She took from a different, deeper pocket\
  \ of her apron a huge iron key, inserted it into the lock, turned it, and pushed\
  \ the door open. In the pitch black of the scullery she heard the sudden rattling\
  \ of chains and fetters. Locking the door behind her, she flicked a switch, and\
  \ a lightbulb on the ceiling cast a dim glow, revealing a huddle of ska musicians,\
  \ chained and fettered.\n\u201CI have pots and pans to scrub,\u201D she announced,\
  \ \u201CSo, my Maytals, play your ska music to cheer me in my chores!\u201D\nAnd\
  \ soon enough the scullery was loud and joyful with the strains of \u201CMonkey\
  \ Man\u201D.\n[2014-09-16]"
