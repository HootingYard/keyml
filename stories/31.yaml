text: "There was a chump and there was a flapper, and they sat in a rowing boat in\
  \ the middle of a vast, vast lake. The lake was so big it might as well have been\
  \ a sea, for neither the chump nor the flapper could see the shore. The chump thought\
  \ he was fop, but the flapper knew she was a flapper.\n\u201CI am a flapper,\u201D\
  \ said the flapper, \u201Cand you are a chump.\u201D\n\u201CI am not a chump,\u201D\
  \ said the chump, insulted, \u201CI am a fop.\u201D\n\u201CEither way,\u201D said\
  \ the flapper, \u201CHand me that oar. It is time we rowed home, for look!, the\
  \ sun is setting, and if we do not row home we will be plunged into darkness out\
  \ here in the middle of the vast, vast lake. Such a prospect gives me the collywobbles.\u201D\
  \nNow you might protest that a world-weary demimondaine flapper is the last person\
  \ in the world to get the collywobbles, and you would probably be correct. Be that\
  \ as it may, the chump, being a chump, took her at her word, and handed her the\
  \ oar, and grabbed hold of the other oar himself, and together they began to row.\
  \ The flapper rowed with insouciant ease, and the chump rowed like a chump, that\
  \ is to say, ineptly, so ineptly that instead of rowing home they rowed to the wrong\
  \ side of the vast, vast lake. That is how the chump and the flapper found themselves,\
  \ at nightfall, surrounded by a gaggle of murderous thugs lumbering about on the\
  \ jetty of an ill-starred fishing village. There was much grunting from the thugs,\
  \ most of whom were wielding clubs, and the clubs were spattered with blood and\
  \ brains and the Lord knows what else.\n\u201CI think it would be a good idea for\
  \ you to essay a tad of chumpery to distract the thugs,\u201D said the flapper to\
  \ the chump.\n\u201CSurely you mean a tad of foppery?\u201D protested the chump.\n\
  \u201CI mean what I say,\u201D snapped the flapper, \u201CAnd be quick about it,\
  \ or we will be bashed by brutes!\u201D\nWiping his hands on his plus-fours, the\
  \ chump was about to engage in diverting chumpery when a police car screeched into\
  \ view behind the murderous thugs, and out stepped Detective Inspector Cargpan!\
  \ Yes, the so-called \u201Cspindly copper\u201D had not, after all, plummeted to\
  \ his doom over a waterfall in some Ruritanian princedom, for he was here, in this\
  \ godforsaken fishing village, accompanied as usual by his troika of deceptively\
  \ diffident bloodhounds, Bim, Bam, and Ubuntu!\nThus, on a moonlit jetty, ended\
  \ the criminal careers of the chump and the flapper. Cargpan placed them in manacles\
  \ and bundled them into the boot of his car, before driving off at inhuman speed\
  \ up into the hills, leaving the thugs to smash the rowing boat, and the rowing\
  \ boat's oars, to smithereens.\n[2007-02-07]"
