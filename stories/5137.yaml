text: "Fossicking in a cupboard the other day, I came upon a piece of writing I'd\
  \ done late in the last century. It contains a splendid anecdote which I can now\
  \ share with you:\nIn 1994 my sister, who lives in the United States, was on a visit\
  \ back to England for a couple of weeks. One day we decided to pay a visit of homage\
  \ to St Patrick's Roman Catholic cemetery in Leytonstone, wherein lie buried the\
  \ five Franciscan nuns whose drowning in the mouth of the Thames in December 1875\
  \ was the event which sparked Gerard Manley Hopkins to write The Wreck Of The Deutschland.\
  \ It was an overcast day in late summer, and we trudged aimlessly around the stones,\
  \ unclear as to what sort of tomb or edifice we were looking for. It is a fairly\
  \ small cemetery, and after half an hour or so we were on the point of abandoning\
  \ the search\u2014I think it was beginning to rain\u2014but as we were going back\
  \ towards the gates we noticed that a light was on in the shabby one-storey building\
  \ near the entrance. We went in, and were greeted by some sort of cemetery attendant.\
  \ My sister began, rather haltingly, to explain that we were looking for the grave\
  \ of some nuns who had been drowned and whom the poet Hopkins had written a\u2026\
  \u2014The attendant held up a hand to stop my sister in mid-flow and, looking over\
  \ his shoulder towards an ajar door behind him, called \u201COi, Mario! Them nuns\
  \ what drowned\u2026\u201D Enter Mario, another cemetery worker, who promptly led\
  \ us to the plot, asked if we were German (as the nuns had been), and explained\
  \ that \u201Cquite a few people come to look at them nuns\u201D. My sister began\
  \ a brief tutorial on Hopkins, but I think Mario had heard it all before\u2014having\
  \ delivered us to our tombstone, he rapidly headed back to whatever he had been\
  \ doing before. Ever since, I have mentally subtitled Hopkins\u2019 great poem \u201C\
  Them Nuns What Drowned\u201D.\n\nPhotograph courtesy of findagrave\n[2010-08-27]"
