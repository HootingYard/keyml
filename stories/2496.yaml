text: "OK, I am going to stop babbling on about John Ruskin, I promise. As a way of\
  \ saying farewell, here is an extract from Fors Clavigera, Letter LXIX ,\u201DThe\
  \ Message Of Jael-Atropos\u201D, 1876. With minimal changes, what I have called\
  \ John Ruskin On The Train could quite easily become Frank Key On The Bus:\nI had\
  \ driven from Brantwood in early morning down the valley of the Crake and took train\
  \ first at the Ulverston station, settling myself in the corner of the carriage\
  \ next the sea, for better prospect thereof. In the other corner was a respectable,\
  \ stolid, middle-aged man reading his paper.\nI had left my Coniston lake in dashing\
  \ ripples under a south wind, thick with rain; but the tide lay smooth and silent\
  \ along the sands; melancholy in absolute pause of motion, nor ebb nor flow distinguishable;\u2014\
  here and there, among the shelves of grey shore, a little ruffling of their apparent\
  \ pools marked stray threadings of river-current.\nAt Grange, talking loud, got\
  \ in two young coxcombs; who reclined themselves on the opposite cushions. One had\
  \ a thin stick, with which, in a kind of St Vitus's dance, partly affectation of\
  \ nonchalance, partly real fever produced by the intolerable idleness of his mind\
  \ and body, he rapped on the elbow of his seat, poked at the button-holes of the\
  \ window strap, and switched his boots, or the air, all the way from Grange to the\
  \ last station before Carnforth,\u2014he and his friend talking yacht and regatta,\
  \ listlessly;\u2014the St Vitus's, meantime, dancing one expressing his opinion\
  \ that \u201Cthe most dangerous thing to do on these lakes was going before the\
  \ wind\u201D. The respectable man went on reading his paper, without notice of them.\
  \ None of the three ever looked out of the windows at sea or shore. There was not\
  \ much to look at, indeed, through the driving, and gradually closer-driven, rain,\u2014\
  except the drifting about of the seagulls and their quiet dropping into the pools,\
  \ their wings kept open for an instant till their breasts felt the water well; then\
  \ closing their petals of white light, like suddenly shut water flowers.\nThe two\
  \ regatta men got out, in drenching rain, on the coverless platform at the station\
  \ before Carnforth, and all the rest of us at Carnforth itself, to wait for the\
  \ up train. The shed on the up-line, even there, is small, in which a crowd of third-class\
  \ passengers were packed close by the outside drip. I did not see one, out of some\
  \ twenty-five or thirty persons, tidily dressed, nor one with a contented and serenely\
  \ patient look. Lines of care, of mean hardship, of comfortless submission, of gnawing\
  \ anxiety, or ill-temper, characterized every face.\nThe train came up, and my poor\
  \ companions were shuffled into it speedily, in heaps. I found an empty first-class\
  \ carriage for myself: wondering how long universal suffrage would allow itself\
  \ to be packed away in heaps, for my convenience.\nAt Lancaster, a father and daughter\
  \ got in; presumably commercial. Father stoutly built and firm-featured, sagacious\
  \ and cool. The girl hard and common; well dressed, except that her hat was cocked\
  \ too high on her hair. They both read papers all the way to Warrington. I was not\
  \ myself employed much better; the incessant rain making the windows a mere wilderness\
  \ of dirty dribblings; and neither Preston nor Wigan presenting anything lively\
  \ to behold, I had settled myself to Mrs Brown on Spelling Bees, (an unusually forced\
  \ and poor number of Mrs Brown, by the way).\nI had to change at Warrington for\
  \ Chester. The weather bettered a little, while I got a cup of tea and a slice of\
  \ bread in the small refreshment room; contemplating, the while, in front of me,\
  \ the panels of painted glass on its swinging doors, which represented two troubadours,\
  \ in broadly striped blue and yellow breeches, purple jackets, and plumed caps;\
  \ with golden-hilted swords and enormous lyres. Both had soft curled moustaches,\
  \ languishing eyes, open mouths, and faultless legs. Meanwhile, lounged at the corner\
  \ behind me, much bemused in beer, a perfect example of the special type of youthful\
  \ blackguard now developing generally in England; more or less blackly pulpous and\
  \ swollen in all the features, and with mingled expression of intense grossness\
  \ and intense impudence;\u2014half pig, half jackdaw.\nThere got in with me, when\
  \ the train was ready, a middle-class person of commercial-traveller aspect, who\
  \ had possessed himself of a \u2018Graphic\u2019 from the news-boy; and whom I presently\
  \ forgot, in examining the country on a line new to me, which became quickly, under\
  \ gleams of broken sunlight, of extreme interest. Azure-green fields of deep corn;\
  \ undulations of sandstone hill, with here and there a broken crag at the edge of\
  \ a cutting; presently the far glittering of the Solway-like sands of Dee, and rounded\
  \ waves of the Welsh hills on the southern horizon, formed a landscape more fresh\
  \ and fair than I have seen for many a day, from any great line of English rail.\
  \ When I looked back to my fellow-traveller, he was sprawling all his length on\
  \ the cushion of the back seat, with his boots on his \u2018Graphic\u2019\u2014\
  not to save the cushions assuredly, but in the foul modern carelessness of everything\
  \ which we have \u2018done with\u2019 for the moment;\u2014his face clouded with\
  \ sullen thought, as of a person helplessly in difficulty, and not able to give\
  \ up thinking how to avoid the unavoidable.\nIn a minute or two more I found myself\
  \ plunged into the general dissolution and whirlpool of porters, passengers, and\
  \ crook-boned trucks, running round corners against one's legs, of the great Chester\
  \ station. A simply-dressed upper-class girl of sixteen or seventeen, strictly and\
  \ swiftly piloting her little sister through the populace, was the first human creature\
  \ I had yet seen, on whom sight could rest without pain. The rest of the crowd was\
  \ a mere dismal fermentation of the Ignominious.\nThe train to Ruabon was crowded,\
  \ and I was obliged to get into a carriage with two cadaverous sexagenarian spinsters,\
  \ who had been keeping the windows up, all but a chink, for fear a drop of rain\
  \ or breath of south wind should come in, and were breathing the richest compound\
  \ of products of their own indigestion. Pretending to be anxious about the construction\
  \ of the train, I got the farther window down, and my body well out of it; then\
  \ put it only half-way up when the train left, and kept putting my head out without\
  \ my hat; so as, if possible, to impress my fellow-passengers with the imminence\
  \ of a collision, which could only be averted by extreme watchfulness on my part.\
  \ Then requesting, with all the politeness I could muster, to be allowed to move\
  \ a box with which they had occupied the corner-seat\u2014\u201Cthat I might sit\
  \ face to the air\u201D\u2014I got them ashamed to ask that the window might be\
  \ shut up again; but they huddled away into the opposite corner to make me understand\
  \ how they suffered from the draught. Presently they got out two bags of blue grapes,\
  \ and ate away unanimously, availing themselves of my open window to throw out rolled-up\
  \ pips and skins.\nGeneral change, to my extreme relief, as to their's, was again\
  \ required at Ruabon, effected by a screwing backwards and forwards, for three-quarters\
  \ of an hour, of carriages which one was expecting every five minutes to get into;\
  \ and which were puffed and pushed away again the moment one opened a door, with\
  \ loud calls of \u2018Stand back there\u2019. A group of half a dozen children,\
  \ from eight to fourteen\u2014the girls all in straw hats, with long hanging scarlet\
  \ ribands\u2014were more or less pleasant to see meanwhile; and sunshine through\
  \ the puffs of petulant and cross-purposed steam, promised a pleasant run to Llangollen.\n\
  I had only the conventional \u2018business man with a paper\u2019 for this run;\
  \ and on his leaving the carriage for Llangollen, was just closing the door, thinking\
  \ to have both windows at command, when my hand was stayed by the father of a family\
  \ of four children, who, with their mother and aunt, presently filled the carriage,\
  \ the children fitting or scrambling in anywhere, with expansive kicks and lively\
  \ struggles. They belonged to the lower-middle class; the mother an ideal of the\
  \ worthy commonplace, evidently hard put to it to make both ends meet, and wholly\
  \ occupied in family concerns; her face fixed in the ignoble gravity of virtuous\
  \ persons to whom their own troublesome households have become monasteries. The\
  \ father, slightly more conscious of external things, submitting benevolently to\
  \ his domestic happiness out on its annual holiday. The children ugly, fidgety,\
  \ and ill-bred, but not unintelligent,\u2014full of questionings, \u2018when\u2019\
  \ they were to get here, or there? how many rails there were on the line; which\
  \ side the station was on, and who was to meet them. In such debate, varied by bodily\
  \ contortions in every direction, they contrived to pass the half-hour which took\
  \ us through the vale of Llangollen, past some of the loveliest brook and glen scenery\
  \ in the world. But neither the man, the woman, nor any one of the children, looked\
  \ out of the window once, the whole way.\nThey got out at Corwen, leaving me to\
  \ myself for the run past Bala lake and down the Dolgelly valley; but more sorrowful\
  \ than of late has been my wont, in the sense of my total isolation from the thoughts\
  \ and ways of the present English people. For I was perfectly certain that among\
  \ all the crowd of living creatures whom I had that day seen,\u2014scarlet ribands\
  \ and all,\u2014there was not one to whom I could have spoken a word on any subject\
  \ interesting to me, which would have been intelligible to them.\nBut the first\
  \ broad sum of fact, for the sake of which I have given this diary, is among certainly\
  \ not less than some seven or eight hundred people, seen by me in the course of\
  \ this day, I saw not one happy face, and several hundreds of entirely miserable\
  \ ones. The second broad sum of fact is, that out of the few,\u2014not happy,\u2014\
  but more or less spirited and complacent faces I saw, among the lower and the mercantile\
  \ classes, what life or spirit they had depended on a peculiar cock-on-a-dunghill\
  \ character of impudence, which meant a total inability to conceive any good or\
  \ lovely thing in this world or any other: and the third sum of fact is, that in\
  \ this rich England I saw only eight out of eight hundred persons gracefully dressed,\
  \ and decently mannered.\n[2009-05-29]"
