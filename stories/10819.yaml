text: 'But in England towers so seldom mellowed rightly. They were too rain-washed,
  weather-beaten, wind-kissed, rugged; they turned tragic and outlived themselves;
  they became such hags of things; they grew dowdy and wore snapdragons; objects for
  picnics; rendezvous of lovers, haunts of vice . . . ; they were made a convenience
  of by owls; they were scarred by names; choked by refuse, and in the end they got
  ghoulish and took to too much ivy, and came toppling down.

  from Ronald Firbank, Vainglory (1915)
