text: 'Incey-wincey badger, scrubbling in the dirt. Puts some sticks together and
  builds himself a yurt. He''s a New Age badger, his name is Little Kurt. Careful
  now, his feelings are very easily hurt.

  Incey-wincey goat-boy, creature of two realms. We can see you darting in between
  the elms. Half of you is human, the other half''s a goat. Incey-wincey goat-boy,
  drowning in a moat.

  Incey-wincey lobster, clacking in the sea. His brain''s completely alien to that
  of you and me. Incey-wincey lobster, much bigger than a bee. The lobster''s very
  strange, and is never ever twee.
