text: "I have had a couple of enquiries from readers asking if Hubermann's department\
  \ store (motto: a byword for utter gorgeousness) has a mail order service. Hubermann's\
  \ was mentioned in both Balsa Wood Crow and Annals Of The Frankish Kings, for those\
  \ of you who need to catch up. I am slightly fretful about Tim Thurn, whose request\
  \ is rather more specific.\nDear Frank, he writes, I am on the lookout for a penis-melting\
  \ Zionist robot comb, not the kind of item a diffident chap like me is going to\
  \ march into a shop and ask for, even in a whisper. I wonder if Hubermann's runs\
  \ a mail order service, and if so whether this is the kind of thing I might find\
  \ in its catalogue?\nWell, Tim, even if Hubermann's did do mail order, this is not\
  \ the kind of thing you'd find in it, for the simple reason that a penis-melting\
  \ Zionist robot comb lacks gorgeousness. Only the gorgeous is to be found in that\
  \ legendary department store.\nThe original shop was opened in 1909 by Jacopo Hubermann,\
  \ and sold only cream crackers, shellac and baize. It was Jacopo's paramour Loopy,\
  \ an international woman of intrigue, who extended the range of stock to include\
  \ other forms of gorgeousness. She believed firmly that the gorgeous could be found\
  \ in all things, both expensive and cheap, hand-crafted and mass-produced, decorative\
  \ and functional. At times, her choices\u2014and those of the smitten Jacopo\u2014\
  were questionable, and stretched the definition of gorgeousness to an alarming degree.\
  \ Loopy was very fond, for example, of mud-splattered gewgaws and filthy discarded\
  \ things, some of which crumbled to dust when picked up. Just before the Great War,\
  \ she was given the run of what became the \u201Cbargain bin basement\u201D of Hubermann's\
  \ in its new premises, a fin de si\xE8cle monstrosity which had previously been\
  \ the headquarters of a SMERSHesque cabal. There were rumours that Loopy continued\
  \ the cabal's sinister business from her hidey-hole next to the pneumatic piping\
  \ system hub, but that was probably just tittle-tattle. Queer stories attached themselves\
  \ to Jacopo Hubermann, too, for it was said that his limp was exaggerated, that\
  \ his startling walrus moustache was counterfeit, that his penumbra of sobriety\
  \ masked the looning of a madcap, and that his cakes were mere crumbs, and breadcrumbs\
  \ at that. All false, of course, for the signal fact about Hubermann was that he\
  \ shimmered like a saint.\nToday there is no bargain bin basement, and the pneumatic\
  \ piping system has been replaced by a new-fangled \xFCberpneumatic piping system,\
  \ but otherwise Hubermann's is, as it has been for nigh on a hundred years, the\
  \ brightest star in the retail sector firmament. The absence of a mail order service\
  \ so perplexed Dobson that he wrote a pamphlet on the subject, which is regrettably\
  \ out of print. He devoted almost forty pages to worrying away at the problem, but\
  \ was unable to reach a sensible conclusion. By the time he finished writing his\
  \ essay, he was in such a foul temper that Marigold Chew dragged him off to the\
  \ snackbar at Hubermann's to stuff his face with lemon meringue pie.\nIncidentally,\
  \ the snackbar at Hubermann's is the very same snackbar where lumbered and stalked\
  \ the snackbar hooligans mentioned at the end of Cargpan And Beppo. And so we find\
  \ that everything in this world is linked by loops of intricate yet unfathomable\
  \ significance. Or so it seems.\n[2007-05-25]"
