text: "\nIn a comment on yesterday's postage about Nixonian soup hatred, Salim Fadhley\
  \ asks the intriguing question if the serving of shark's fin soup at a dinner on\
  \ the President's state visit to China in 1972 prompted one of his \u201Csix crises\u201D\
  . We shall overlook the fact that Nixon published his book of that title ten years\
  \ earlier, in 1962, and we shall also overlook the fact that Mr Fadhley's question\
  \ is easily answered, either by reading the book itself or, if the prospect of hundreds\
  \ of pages of Nixonian prose does not appeal, a summary of its contents which can\
  \ be found on the wikipedia. We will soon learn that the shark's fin soup did not\
  \ pose a crisis for Nixon, or at least not one of the six he wrote about.\nBut that\
  \ is so disappointing, is it not? I would prefer to think that there is another\
  \ book by Nixon, entitled perhaps Soup Crises, in which the thirty-seventh Potus\
  \ describes in dramatic and unflinching detail the various soup crises he had to\
  \ face. If, in the course of his life, there were only four soup crises, then an\
  \ alternative title for the book could be The Four Soups. Happily, this is an anagram\
  \ of House Of Turps, an out of print pamphlet by Mr Key. Could it be that I was\
  \ anagrammatically channelling Nixon in 1989? I must consult a brain quack to delve\
  \ into this important question.\n[2013-02-06]"
