text: "Among the most inventive minds at work today are our management consultants,\
  \ those busy-brained men and women forever thinking up exciting new ideas for the\
  \ world of work. We are all, I hope, familiar by now with \u201CHot Desking\u201D\
  , a revolutionary approach which allows a business to sell off half of its office\
  \ furniture for the greater good. Now I learn, somewhat belatedly, that the BBC\
  \ has launched a \u201CHot Shoes\u201D initiative. First the furniture, now the\
  \ clothes. What will be the next hot thing?\nHere at Hooting Yard we always try\
  \ to keep one step ahead of the latest management thinking, so we tasked Mrs Gubbins\
  \ to come up with a list of hot thing initiatives. Being an octogenarian crone,\
  \ La Gubbins baulked at the use of \u201Ctasked\u201D as a verb, but we fed her\
  \ a bowl of gravy pudding and offered to help find that knitting needle she mislaid,\
  \ and she soon came on board.\nShe initially decided to set up a working party to\
  \ originate and assess various hot ideas, but this was felt to be crass, until it\
  \ dropped the \u201Cworking party\u201D title and renamed itself as an \u201Cideas\
  \ silo\u201D. The silo has a hub with radii, each radius has a directional pointing\
  \ device, and at the end point of each is a \u201Cbrain crate\u201D. Responsibility\
  \ for sifting through the crates rests with Mrs Gubbins herself, in between her\
  \ core activities of knitting tea cosies and taking naps.\nAs a result of her first\
  \ such sift, Hooting Yard will shortly be launching a series of hot initiatives\
  \ entitled \u201CHot Pencil Sharpeners\u201D, \u201CHot Carpets\u201D, \u201CHot\
  \ Puddings\u201D and \u201CHot Peter Wyngarde Monogrammed Cravats\u201D. I think\
  \ readers will be able to appreciate the tremendous benefits these hot things will\
  \ have on the ongoing Hooting Yard project. And remember, you are important to us.\
  \ Please let us know what we can do to make further 360\xB0 improvements.\n[2007-10-27]"
