text: "Gosh! On this day, ten long years ago, on Sunday 14 December 2003, the Hooting\
  \ Yard blog came mewling into the world! Strange to think, is it not?, there was\
  \ once a time that this website did not exist, to give pleasure to teeming millions\
  \ dozens.\nIn order to celebrate a decade of Hooting Yard, I think I will post each\
  \ day between now and Christmas an item from each calendar year. Not a \u201Cbest\
  \ of \u2026\u201D, nor even particularly my own favourites, but a fair jumble of\
  \ potsages [sic] designed to instruct, enlighten, and entertain.\nReaders may wish\
  \ to join in the celebrations by making a donation to ensure Hooting Yard continues\
  \ to flourish for the next ten glorious years.\nThis splendid quotation first appeared\
  \ on Friday 19 December 2003.\nIn my own case I have imputed my early baldness to\
  \ growth in intellectuality and spirituality induced by my fondness for and devotion\
  \ to books. Miss Susan, my sister, lays it to other causes, first among which she\
  \ declares to be my unnatural practice of reading in bed, and the second my habit\
  \ of eating welsh-rarebits late of nights. Over my bed I have a gas-jet so properly\
  \ shaded that the rays of light are concentrated and reflected downward upon the\
  \ volume which I am reading. Miss Susan insists that much of this light and its\
  \ attendant heat falls upon my head, compelling there a dryness of the scalp whereby\
  \ the follicles have been deprived of their natural nourishment and have consequently\
  \ died. She furthermore maintains that the welsh-rarebits of which I partake invariably\
  \ at the eleventh hour every night breed poisonous vapors and subtle megrims within\
  \ my stomach, which humors, rising by their natural courses to my brain, do therein\
  \ produce a fever that from within burneth up the fluids necessary to a healthy\
  \ condition of the capillary growth upon the super-adjacent and exterior cranial\
  \ integument.\nEugene Field, The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac.\nEugene Field also\
  \ wrote, among many other works, the children's rhyme Wynken, Blynken & Nod. He\
  \ had a childhood sweetheart with the marvellous name Captivity Waite. I wonder\
  \ if she was any relation to the splendid Asenath Waite in H P Lovecraft's The Thing\
  \ On The Doorstep? Glubb\u2026 glubb\u2026 glubb.\n[2013-12-14]"
