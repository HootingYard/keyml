text: 'In Pointy Town, when they bury a dead Pointy Towner in the Pointy Town cemetery,
  they dig a pointy grave using a pointy shovel. The gravediggers have pointy spades,
  too, but they are not as pointy as the shovels. The shovels could not be more pointy.

  There is a price to be paid for all this pointiness. It is a price paid sometimes
  in blood, sometimes in coinage, and sometimes in toads. Pointy Towners will roam
  the marsh flats outside Pointy Town collecting in baskets the toads that live there.
  Most of the toads have pointy bits, though perhaps they are more knobby than pointy.
  Pointy Town''s genetic engineers are working hard to breed a pointier toad. If and
  when they succeed, the knobby toads will become worthless as currency and will be
  left to go about their toady business in the marsh flats undisturbed.
