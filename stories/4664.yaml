text: "\u201COrdnance Survey Map 104\_: Leeds and Bradford\u2026 It's a riot of names\
  \ that could be nowhere else but Yorkshire: villages such as Luddendon Foot, Mytholmroyd,\
  \ Farsley Beck Bottom, Wibsey, Odsal, Idle, Owlet, Harden, Greetland, Rastrick,\
  \ Ossett, Soothill, Scarcroft, Wike, Kirkby Overblow, Spofforth, Scriven, Blubberhouses,\
  \ Stainburn, Birstwith, Thwaites Brow, Cringles, Glusburn and Goose Eye\u2014a list\
  \ that sounds more like entries in a dictionary of Dickensian ailments.\u201D\n\
