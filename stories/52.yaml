text: "Pansy Cradledew bought a new kettle recently. Tempting though it is to use\
  \ this as an excuse to regale you with my all-encompassing kettle theories\u2014\
  and believe me, you will be impressed\u2014I'd like instead to say a few words about\
  \ the particular make of kettle Ms Cradledew purchased.\nThere is an egg-shaped\
  \ window in the side of the kettle which enables the pleased-as-punch kettle owner\
  \ to see at a glance the water level of the water that has been poured out of a\
  \ tap or spigot into the kettle. It may be argued that I could rewrite that sentence\
  \ so that it is less ungainly and doesn't mention the kettle three times, but I\
  \ want to be absolutely clear and I am writing in a rush. There is a pot of tea\
  \ to be brewed, and I cannot type and make tea at the same time. You try it, and\
  \ see how difficult it is.\nWhen the power is on, but the kettle is switched off,\
  \ that is, when it is plugged in to the wall socket and the wall socket is switched\
  \ on but the kettle remains in its default, at rest, idle state, an internal light\
  \ is activated, and through the egg-shaped window the excited kettle owner sees\
  \ a blue glow. This has the effect of making the water look not unlike a tropical\
  \ sea, or at least a tiny portion of such a sea, on a blazing hot summer day\u2014\
  no small benefit when one lives in a land of ice chaos.\nDepress the switch underneath\
  \ the kettle's handle, however, and the blue glow is instantly transformed into\
  \ a glow that is bright red. The kettle is now on, and begins to boil the water\
  \ which was poured into it from the tap, or spigot. Gradually, it begins to bubble.\
  \ As it approaches boiling point, the combination of seething, bubbling water and\
  \ a blood-red glow makes it look like a scene from hell. Satan's spa!\nI may write\
  \ about further kitchen-based excitements at a later date, but now it is time for\
  \ that pot of tea.\n[2007-02-15]"
