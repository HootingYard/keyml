text: 'So who are they, these folk who dwell on the sandbank, in cardboard shelters?
  For the most part, they are retired sleuths, old hands who met each other long ago
  at the Picnic For Detectives, where they discovered a shared interest in sandbanks,
  cardboard hovels, and monsters of the deep. They pointedly ignore the shoals that
  swim in the shallows beyond the sandbank. There is not an angler among them. The
  occasional sighting of a lobster or a jellyfish excites them, and such is the brouhaha
  that one or more of the cardboard shelters collapses, from overbuffeting, and has
  to be re-erected before the stars come out at night. Not even the hardiest of retired
  detectives wants to spend the hours of darkness exposed, on a sandbank, to the pitiless
  gleam of moon and stars. They have their superstitions and their irrational fears,
  these dwellers on the sandbank, just like anyone else.

  In daylight, they keep watch on the waters. Some are armed with electronic devices,
  run on batteries. They tick off sightings of minor monsters, such as the aforementioned
  lobsters and jellyfish, in ledgers. But what all of them await is for there to be
  a great uncanny churning maelstrom from which emerges a gigantic and terrible sea-creature
  never before seen by human detective eyes.

  They set traps and lures, though they know not what precisely might tempt such a
  monster. Sprats? Minnows? Scraps of cardboard? The liver and lights of a hare or
  a crow? They have tried all these to no avail.

  Every so often the wind whips in and blows their cardboard shelters into the sea.
  Then, the more nautically-gifted of the retired sleuths, those who once worked in
  plain clothes aboard ocean liners and cruise ships, perhaps, bound into a rowing
  boat and strain to retrieve the precious cardboard sheets. There is plenty of space
  on the sandbank to lay out the soaked and wind-scarred cardboard for drying out
  in the sun.

  In homage to the old days, they picnic, these sandbank sleuths, and they picnic
  hard. Not for them such girly snacks as watercress sandwiches with the crusts cut
  off. They bite the lids off jamjars and spit them into a pit. Drifting sands, ah,
  drifting sands soon cover the pit of lids, it is effaced from the planet''s surface
  as if it had never been. But down there, beneath the sands, attracted by the metal
  lids, there are creatures burrowing, blind, mole-like creatures that sniff the metal,
  and the traces of raspberry jam and marmalade adhering to the metal, and they burrow
  with their snouts and claws, and one night soon they will push their gruesome heads
  above the sands, and exult in the moonlight, and gorge themselves on jam and marmalade
  and cardboard and sleeping sleuths.
