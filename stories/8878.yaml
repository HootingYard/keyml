text: "I am angry, I am ill, and I'm as ugly as sin. My irritability keeps me alive\
  \ and kicking.\nThat was me, sitting bolt upright in bed upon waking at dawn, singing\
  \ my little heart out, like a chaffinch or a linnet. I sang A Song From Under The\
  \ Floorboards by Magazine. Now, regular listeners to my radio show on Resonance104.4FM,\
  \ Hooting Yard On The Air, will be well aware that I cannot sing for toffee. Recite\
  \ prose, yes. Sing, no. But while I would never dream of assailing the ears of an\
  \ unsuspecting public by singing\u2014or attempting to sing\u2014on the airwaves,\
  \ there is no reason why I should not do so in the privacy of my own home.\nIt has\
  \ become apparent to me, you see, that the lives of people in film musicals have\
  \ that little extra spark, simply because they have the facility to burst into song\
  \ at appropriate moments in their day. I am not personally acquainted with any chimney\
  \ sweeps, but it seems clear that Bert, in Mary Poppins (Robert Stevenson, 1964),\
  \ as portrayed by Dick Van Dyke, almost certainly has a happier and more fulfilling\
  \ life than the average sweep, simply due to the fact that he gets to sing about\
  \ it. The same is true of many of the nuns in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965).\
  \ Their lives, circumscribed by the iron rules of convent life, and with Nazis running\
  \ rampage outwith the nunnery walls, must have been fairly grim. Who can doubt that\
  \ by belting out Climb Every Mountain once in a while, their hearts were immeasurably\
  \ cheered?\nHaving recourse to a repertoire of songs also allows one to provide\
  \ a musical commentary upon one's day, which can be a straightforward reflection\
  \ of one's mood (Zippity Doo Dah) or an ironic commentary upon it (Zippity Doo Dah,\
  \ Queuing In The Gutter For The Soup Kitchen Version). In the more anarchic musicals,\
  \ of course, there is little or no connection between what is going on in the characters\u2019\
  \ lives and the songs they choose to break into, often suddenly and without warning.\
  \ It is this latter approach that appeals to me. After all, when I woke up I was\
  \ not particularly angry, nor ill, nor even irritable. I may have been somewhat\
  \ ugly, before preening and primping myself in the mirror until I took on the bedazzling\
  \ appearance of a Sun God. But Howard Devoto's Dostoyevsky-inspired ditty seemed\
  \ just the thing, at the time, as did Hans Werner Henze's raucous and discordant\
  \ Essay On Pigs while I prepared what our Belgian pals call het ontbijt.\nIn musicals,\
  \ the characters usually have the benefit of accompaniment, whether it be a full\
  \ orchestra or, in certain trendy pop musicals, a beat combo. A penurious scribbler\
  \ such as myself obviously cannot employ a troupe of musicians to stand ready, out\
  \ of sight in a corner of whichever room I happen to be in, to strike up the tune\
  \ in those heady moments before I start singing. At the same time, one does not\
  \ wish to limit oneself simply to an a cappella soundtrack. In the circumstances,\
  \ the best thing to do is to throw caution to the winds and to carry on regardless.\
  \ That is why, after breakfast, as I pottered aimlessly about before taking my morning\
  \ stroll, I delivered a spine-tingling version of Oye Como Va by Santana.\nLater,\
  \ as I trudged along the towpath of the filthy old canal towards the newsagent,\
  \ there was a fortuitous conjunction of life and song. I was accosted by a yapping\
  \ dog which had slipped its master's leash and was now making a canalside nuisance\
  \ of itself. I could not help noticing it was a slow dog, with see-through skin,\
  \ the kind of dog you can see through, so I sang Slow Dog by Belly, or as much of\
  \ it as I could remember.\nThough I decently refrain from singing into a microphone\
  \ at the Resonance studios, and thus broadcasting my tuneless caterwauling to the\
  \ masses huddled over their radio sets, I have no such compunction when I am out\
  \ and about in my bailiwick. If I am overheard, say by a man trailing a leash in\
  \ search of a fled dog on a canal towpath, I may stop my singing if, in sizing him\
  \ up, I suspect he is intent on silencing me by means of violence. The wisdom of\
  \ ceasing to sing when so threatened was brought home to me after a memorable incident\
  \ involving a whirling tangle of intoxicated ruffians and my rendering of The Windmills\
  \ Of Your Mind, famously sung by Noel Harrison in the film The Thomas Crown Affair\
  \ (Norman Jewison, 1968). That I was in the vicinity of a windmill at the time was\
  \ perhaps pertinent, as was the fact that the ruffians had been drinking all day\
  \ in a squalid tavern called the Cow & Pins.\nMost of the people whose ears may\
  \ be assaulted by my singing out of doors will not actually beat me insensible,\
  \ as the ruffians did. They will simply pass on by, perhaps with a look of reproach,\
  \ or nausea, or pity. But it once happened that I was on my way to the newsagent,\
  \ trudging along the towpath of the filthy old canal, when I encountered a trained,\
  \ professional, indeed famous, musician. He was standing on one leg, playing the\
  \ flute. I wish I could remember his name. Anyway, along I came, happy as a lark,\
  \ singing Jack In The Green by Jethro Tull, and this fellow, rather than ignoring\
  \ me or attacking me, gave me a useful piece of advice. Why, he asked, did I not\
  \ limit my repertoire to works intended to be performed in Sprechgesang, or even\
  \ better Sprechstimme? I need not sing at all, but could still indulge my musical\
  \ passion. Well, all I can say is that I tried it, for a week or two, but quite\
  \ frankly Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire begins to pall after a while, and there are\
  \ only so many bits of grumpy Germanic avant garde folderol a man can tolerate.\
  \ The Hans Werner Henze piece works well enough before breakfast, but after that\
  \ I like something a bit less\u2026 difficult.\nThat is why, today, on my way back\
  \ from the newsagent, I sent whole flocks of birds scattering from their perches\
  \ with a spirited rendition of Hungry Freaks, Daddy by the Mothers of Invention.\n\
