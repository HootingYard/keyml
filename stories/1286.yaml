text: "Bluestocking polymath Dot Tint has a new book out next month, a magisterial\
  \ study of aquatic birds entitled Dot's Ducks. There are two very curious things\
  \ about this hefty hardback, and I think it right that you are made aware of them\
  \ before shelling out your cash for a copy.\nIt is the first of Dot Tint's innumerable\
  \ books not to feature on its dust jacket a mezzotint by her brother Rex Tint, the\
  \ noted mezzotintist. Indeed, a considerable number of her earlier titles have been\
  \ absolutely riddled with mezzotints, often quite gratuitously, so much so that\
  \ there are cynics who claim Dot is keeping Rex gainfully employed, whereas without\
  \ her patronage he would be starving in some sort of mezzotintist's garret, surviving\
  \ on stale croissant crusts and tap water. This is piffle, of course, for Rex Tint\
  \ is never short of commissions, and has been known to turn work down, for example\
  \ when he was asked a couple of years ago to create a gigantic mezzotint to be displayed\
  \ on the wall of a house owned by the Belgian actor and martial arts expert Jean-Claude\
  \ Camille Fran\xE7ois Van Varenberg, better known as Jean-Claude Van Damme. It is\
  \ not known whether the star chose his professional name to echo Philip Vandamm,\
  \ the villain played by James Mason in North By Northwest, but we do know that Rex\
  \ Tint snubbed him despite being offered a very large amount of Belgian money. Whether\
  \ Dot pays Rex at all for the mezzotints he has until now provided for her books\
  \ is unclear, making the charge that he is a kept mezzotintist all the more laughable.\
  \ The absence of his work from Dot's Ducks has led to speculation that there may\
  \ have been a falling out between the siblings. Rex is notoriously temperamental,\
  \ and has recently grown a preposterous beard, thus obscuring the distinctive Tint\
  \ family cast of his features, so that might be something to do with it. I suppose\
  \ if he shaves his beard off and is subsequently invited by his sister to provide\
  \ mezzotints for her next book we will have a better understanding of the matter.\
  \ Time will tell.\nThe second curious thing about Dot's Ducks is the inclusion of\
  \ a vast amount of material about owls. Owls are not ducks, and Dot Tint cannot\
  \ seriously believe that they are. Yet there are pages upon pages of owl-related\
  \ material, offered without any qualification or explanation. I have read my advance\
  \ copy of the book twice, all the way through, and sure enough, we go from mallard\
  \ to merganser to teal to owl to shelduck to pochard to bufflehead, as if, in Dot\
  \ Tint's world, owls are ducks. It is all very strange. Or at least, it was, until\
  \ quite by chance the other day I came upon what may be an answer to the riddle.\
  \ I was browsing through a back number of the magazine Traumatic Childhood Incidents\
  \ Of Bluestocking Polymaths, and lo and behold, there was a lengthy piece of anecdotage\
  \ about Dot Tint. Apparently, when she was five or six years old, on a family holiday\
  \ at a gruesome seaside resort, she was gambolling and frolicking upon the beach\
  \ when, panting with infant glee, she stopped to catch her breath and looked out\
  \ to sea, where she saw a rowing boat. Her eyesight was piercing back then, and\
  \ she could clearly make out that there were two people in the rowing boat. One\
  \ was rowing, in a fairly lacklustre way, while the other person was holding a sack.\
  \ All of a sudden, as Dot Tint watched, this person took an owl out of the sack\
  \ and held it under the water until it drowned, whereupon the dead owl was put back\
  \ in the sack and the rower rowed the rowing boat away with greater urgency. It\
  \ does not take a mind doctor to conclude that the traumatised child thereafter\
  \ held fast to the delusion that owls were ducks, the water their habitat, and that\
  \ she had not seen an owl cruelly drowned but merely one taking a dip in the sea.\
  \ If anything, this forgotten magazine article makes Dot's Ducks an even more compelling\
  \ book than it otherwise would be, despite the absence of mezzotints by the mezzotintist\
  \ Rex Tint. I'd buy it if I were you.\n[2009-01-02]"
