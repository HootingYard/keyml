text: "Astute reader Roland Clare reminds me that the soft drink sloshed all over\
  \ the canteen table by the narrator of Impugned By A Peasant was the subject of\
  \ an Andy Warhol painting.\n\nThree Cans Of Squelcho! (1966) recently fetched untold\
  \ billions of dollars at auction. The buyer remained anonymous, though the word\
  \ on the street* suggests the picture now hangs in the foetid lair of the Grunty\
  \ Man, up in the hills. The Grunty Man has been a keen art collector for some centuries.\
  \ If you look very, very carefully, you can spot him at the back of the auction\
  \ scene in North By Northwest, where Roger O Thornhill (Cary Grant) confronts Philip\
  \ Vandamm (James Mason) and causes a kerfuffle.\n* NOTE\_: Blister Lane, apparently.\n\
