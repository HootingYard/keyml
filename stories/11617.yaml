text: "I met my antagonist in vegetation and in awe. The vegetation was a patch of\
  \ scrub and gorse and bracken and furze and phlox and lupins and stunted hollyhocks,\
  \ behind the towpath that goes along beside the canal, leading to the sea, which\
  \ in turn leads on to all the major oceans, Indian, Atlantic, Pacific, I can't remember\
  \ the names of the others offhand. I was in awe because my antagonist, too, was\
  \ in awe, and awe has a way of feeding off itself, and increasing exponentially.\
  \ We made a handshake last for hours.\nThe stunting of the hollyhocks looked natural,\
  \ organic, or so it seemed to me. They did not appear to have been pollarded, like\
  \ the willows by the canal just before the level crossing. The patch of vegetation\
  \ was equidistant, I would guess, from the level crossing, along the canal in one\
  \ direction, and the sea, in the other. I could draw you a map, if you wanted me\
  \ to. I do not think I would have been able to then, in the immediate aftermath\
  \ of our meeting. My antagonist had a very firm handshake, intimidatingly so, and\
  \ I was not to be intimidated, so I grasped his hand all the more firmly. I think\
  \ we were bent on crushing each other's bones. Neither of us was willing to relinquish\
  \ the hand of the other. That is why we stood there, in vegetation and awe, like\
  \ a pair of ninnies, shaking hands for hours.\nI had come from the level crossing,\
  \ he from the sea. His shoes and trouser-cuffs were still wet. It was a humid day.\
  \ The stunted hollyhocks drooped. The air was thick with flies. In the distance,\
  \ we could hear the sound of violins. I remember the sense of awe as if it were\
  \ yesterday, though it was the day before yesterday. I wanted to smoke, and I managed\
  \ to extricate a cigarette from the packet in my pocket and put it between my lips\
  \ and take my lighter and ignite the cigarette with deft movements of my left hand.\
  \ My right was still clutching the right hand of my antagonist in that long, long\
  \ handshake. For a moment I thought he was going to mirror my actions, for he put\
  \ his left hand in his pocket, but when he took it out he was holding a boiled sweet.\
  \ As deft as I, he unwrapped it from its twisted cellophane wrapper and popped it\
  \ into his mouth. He let fall the wrapper, and it landed upon a lupin. I was disconcerted\u2014\
  I had not had my antagonist down as a litterbug.\nHe took advantage of my momentary\
  \ disconcertment to tighten his grip on my hand. I puffed a mouthful of smoke into\
  \ his face. He blinked once or twice but marshalled himself, but his grip relaxed\
  \ just a little. We both adjusted our footing, me in my Tyrolean postman's boots\
  \ and he in his wet shoes and socks. I think they were quite expensive shoes, though\
  \ I am no great judge of these matters. I suppose when one lives by the sea one\
  \ has to pay due attention to one's footwear.\nNeither of us said a word. What would\
  \ have been the point? We spoke in different tongues, mine that of the interior,\
  \ his, like Beau Brummell speaking French, that of those accustomed to chewing pebbles\
  \ and talking next to the sea. Without a pebble, he made do with his boiled sweet.\
  \ Even if we had shared a language, we were too awestruck to speak. And as our awe\
  \ grew, so did our antagonism. Would either of us claim victory?\nI do not know\
  \ how many hours had passed when the referee emerged from somewhere behind the clumps\
  \ of scrub and gorse and bracken and furze and phlox and lupins and stunted hollyhocks.\
  \ He flicked his ribbon at our hands, still clenched in handshake, and pronounced\
  \ a tie. We would have to return, to the same place, at the same time, next week.\
  \ He hinted that there might be television crews eager to cover our confrontation.\n\
  Our seconds appeared, and bore us home on palanquins, me to the chalet by the level\
  \ crossing, he to the sea, the sea. He took my cigarette butt as a memento, and\
  \ I pocketed his boiled sweet wrapper. At sunset, the patch of vegetation was deserted\
  \ and undisturbed, as if we had never fought there at all, as if the whole thing\
  \ had been but a dream.\n[2013-06-18]"
