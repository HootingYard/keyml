  \ this place has become AntiFry Central. The Most Intelligent Life-Form In The Known\
  \ Universe was interviewed on BBC's Newsnight yesterday\u2014mercifully briefly\u2014\
  about the MPs\u2019 expenses hoo-hah. He claimed that everybody, including himself,\
  \ fiddled their expenses, that it was nothing to get worked up about, and that making\
  \ a fuss about it was \u201Cbourgeois\u201D. (This while suited and booted in black\
  \ tie for some event he was attending.) Oh, how we vomited here at Haemoglobin Towers!\n\
  I have a new heroine, however. Back in the studio, discussing the same topic, the\
  \ MP Kate Hoey referred contemptuously to \u201Cthat actor, whoever he is\u201D\
  \ and how he was talking twaddle. Gold star for her.\n[2009-05-12]"
