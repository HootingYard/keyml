text: "\u201CAllahu Akbar!\u201D I shout, as I deadhead the roses. I am an Islamic\
  \ gardener. The gardens I tend are based upon Islamic principles, and contain not\
  \ a whiff of kaffir filth. No woman shall ever besmirch the gravel paths between\
  \ the flower beds. And whenever a bloom sprouts atop a green stalk, I take my combination\
  \ scimitar-and-secateurs and lop it off, in praise of Allah.\nThe only plants I\
  \ allow to flourish are varieties of Old Man's Beard, including Chionanthus virginicus,\
  \ a tree both medicinal and ornamental, Clematis aristata, an Australian climbing\
  \ plant, Clematis vitalba, another climbing plant, Tillandsia usneoides, or Spanish\
  \ moss, a bromeliad, and Usnea, a type of lichen. Because they vaguely resemble\
  \ an old man's beard, they are suitably Islamic.\nOccasionally I am mistaken for\
  \ a hippy gardener, Steve Hillage of Gong with a spade in place of a guitar. I have\
  \ been told we are like two peas in a pod. But there are no peas in my gardens,\
  \ because peapods do not have beards.\n\nSteve Hillage\_: not an Islamic fundamentalist\n\
