text: "The word \u201CMedium\u201D to me suggests a Victorian charlatan in a darkened\
  \ room, summoning the spirits of the dead and spewing forth ectoplasm. \u201CMedium\u201D\
  \ is also, I learn, the name of a new(ish?) bit of interwebbery, a repository for\
  \ prose, a sort of amalgam of bloggery and twittering. Those more familiar with\
  \ these matters could no doubt explain it better. But Hooting Yard is always bang\
  \ up to the minute with the latest developments in technology, and not just L'Oreal's\
  \ light-reflecting booster technology. That is why Mr Key has taken a tentative\
  \ step into Medium, by reposting that recent spot of wittering about surrealism.\n\
  I may add further pieces to the site, and you lot can all hie over there with your\
  \ knapsacks and a packed lunch, and \u201Crecommend\u201D me. Who knows if conquering\
  \ Medium will be a profitable step on the path to our ultimate goal of Hooting Yard\
  \ Global Dominion?\n[2014-02-05]"
