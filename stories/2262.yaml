text: 'Mr Key would like to draw to your attention a very promising new blog entitled
  The Pavilion Of Innocent Pastimes. Its onlie begetter is Hooting Yard''s Antipodean
  research boffin Glyn Webster. The latest postage, entitled A page from an O''Houlihan''s
  Wharf primer?, is particularly splendid, and is reproduced below, but do not let
  that deter you from making many, many visits to the site itself.
