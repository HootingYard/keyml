text: "Having dismissed the idea of running a series examining the gloveboxes of the\
  \ rich and famous, I wondered if instead it might be interesting to run a series\
  \ on the boxing gloves of the indigent and wretched. That's right, I had finally\
  \ taken leave of my senses, again. What was I thinking? For one thing, I know precious\
  \ little about boxing, or its gloves. Second, I would rather know much less than\
  \ I do about the indigent and wretched, otherwise known as riff-raff. Much, much\
  \ less. If I never came upon another member of the riff-raff I would die a happy\
  \ man. Unfortunately, on the rare occasions when I emerge from my barrel of reclusion\
  \ and venture into the outside world, I can barely move for the teeming throngs\
  \ of riff-raff.\nIncidentally, if you followed the link above, do take the opportunity\
  \ to buy the record. It is very good indeed.\nI am always amused by the fact that\
  \ the Corbynistas and their like claim to be devoted to the needs of the riff-raff.\
  \ They hate and despise the riff-raff even more than I do. It is a mutual loathing,\
  \ which the Corbynistas explain by saying the riff-raff are bedevilled by \u201C\
  false consciousness\u201D. Frankly I would be surprised if the riff-raff I encounter\
  \ have any consciousness whatsoever, unless it be a malign intention to exasperate\
  \ me. That is something in which they demonstrate an almost enviable skill.\nClearly,\
  \ given the above, I am not best placed to write about the boxing gloves of the\
  \ indigent and wretched. Could I, then, turn my attention to the boxing gloves of\
  \ the rich and famous? I suppose I could, but for the full run of a series? That\
  \ seems dubious, to say the least. Once I had dealt with Ernest Hemingway's many\
  \ and various punch-ups, with a nod to Joan Mir\xF3\_and Arthur Cravan, I would\
  \ pretty much have exhausted my knowledge. Add to which Hemingway's fist-fights\
  \ were usually boxing gloveless\u2014as when he knocked Wallace Stevens into a puddle\
  \ (1936)\u2014and Arthur Cravan was neither rich nor famous in his time, and the\
  \ paucity of material I have to draw on becomes horribly apparent.\nSo, to face\
  \ brute facts, that is another projected series I shall have to dismiss as a hopeless\
  \ dream. Oh, that gives me an idea! Hopeless Dreams of the Riff-Raff! Now there\
  \ is a topic I could get my teeth into. And, being based on dreams, I could just\
  \ make it all up. No pesky research required. I shall start work on it immediately.\n\
