text: "After the French Revolution, a law was passed that bells should be removed\
  \ from churches and melted down to make cannons. \u201CThese monuments to the luxury\
  \ of our cities and to the vanity of their inhabitants\u201D explained one public\
  \ prosecutor in 1793, \u201Ccan be more usefully employed in bringing terror and\
  \ death\u201D to the enemies of the republic. Not all towns and villages co-operated.\n\
  In November 1793, the mayor [of Saint Cornier-des-Landes], a republican, decided\
  \ to follow the letter of the law and take down the bells. The operation dragged\
  \ on, however, as the patriots staying at the local inn shirked the task. The former\
  \ \u201Ccustos\u201D of the church, a post that had been handed down within the\
  \ same family for almost two hundred years, managed to persuade them to drink perry\
  \ . . . which delayed the operation, since by then night had fallen. Pierre Duchesnay,\
  \ the servant of the mayor's aunt, was delighted to discover that the vehicle he\
  \ had brought to move the bells was now quite useless.\nIn the following days the\
  \ people of Saint Cornier prided themselves on having succeeded where neighbouring\
  \ communes had failed so lamentably. A few weeks later, a commissioner from the\
  \ revolutionary committee of Domfront, escorted by a \u201Cjuring\u201D priest and\
  \ a wagoner, came to seize the bells in question. He seemed to be in somewhat of\
  \ a hurry and remarked to the mayor that he should have razed the bell tower because\
  \ it was an affront to the principal of equality. It was then that a former bailiff\
  \ residing in the commune decided to \u201Cplay a trick\u201D on the authorities\
  \ by installing in the bell tower one Gabriel Duchesnay, a journeyman woodcutter\
  \ who was armed with an axe and instructed to feign madness. After a drink or two,\
  \ the commissioner set out to capture the bells, whereupon he heard the woodcutter\
  \ order him to go back down. \u201CIf you climb up and lay a finger on the bells,\
  \ I'll cut you right down!\u201D cried the madman. The mayor, who had gotten wise\
  \ to the trick, confirmed that it was indeed a genuine madman and the commissioner\
  \ had to withdraw.\nfrom Village Bells\_: Sound And Meaning In The Nineteenth-Century\
