text: "Duff, for those you woefully ignorant of its meaning, is all that stuff on\
  \ the forest floor\u2014dead plant material, leaves and bits of bark and needles\
  \ and twigs, that has fallen to the ground and lies there, rotting, rotting. As\
  \ it rots it is enmingled with the top layer of soil and this is what scientists\
  \ call the O horizon. I am not a scientist, so I stick to duff.\nSome would have\
  \ you believe that the duffle or duffel coat is so called because it is made from\
  \ coarse thick woollen material originally made in the Belgian town of Duffel. Likewise\
  \ the duffle or duffel bag. Although this is almost certainly true, and not really\
  \ open to doubt, we should not overlook the fact that long long long ago, primitive\
  \ shambling savages lumbering about the primeval forests fashioned for themselves\
  \ clothing and bags made from the duff on the forest floor, thus duff coats and\
  \ duff bags, easily tweaked to become duffel or duffle by the vagaries of human\
  \ speech.\nOf course, it was all so long ago that no one living has ever seen a\
  \ primitive shambling savage making a coat or bag out of duff. Intuitively, one\
  \ might think the thing would simply fall apart. Perhaps when first gathered up\
  \ from the forest floor, the duff would be wet and sticky and thus hold together.\
  \ But time, heat, drying out, and certain exertions on the part of the savage would\
  \ surely make a duff coat fall to bits soon enough. And one wonders what could possibly\
  \ be carried in a duff bag without it, too, being rendered useless.\nClearly, then,\
  \ our primitive shambling savage forest-dwelling ancestors must have devised a method\
  \ of strengthening the matted duff. They may have used rudimentary needlework, or\
  \ perhaps a type of glue or gum. The best way to find out was to conduct an experiment.\
  \ That is why I had myself parachuted, stark naked, into a forest. I should point\
  \ out that the parachute was made of tough synthetic twenty-first century fabric,\
  \ not from duff. I have never argued that primitive shambling savages made duff\
  \ parachutes, so I was not being inconsistent. Once I had landed, high in some tree\
  \ cover, I unhitched myself from my harness and clambered down to ground level.\
  \ I had made an appointment to meet up with my research team in twenty-four hours\
  \ time, in the Cow & Pins, a somewhat insalubrious tavern on the edge of the forest.\n\
  Standing naked and alone in the dark dense forest, I found it easy to imagine myself\
  \ a primitive shambling savage in the dim and distant past. I grunted a few times.\
  \ I spotted a tiny wriggling creepy crawly on the trunk of a tree and plucked it\
  \ off and popped it into my mouth and chewed it and swallowed it. It tasted foul.\
  \ I began to feel like a monkey. The strange thing is that within five minutes of\
  \ landing in the forest I had actually become primitive and shambling and savage.\
  \ I quite forgot about my appointment. I forgot about my everyday life. I forgot\
  \ language. I grunted and scratched and ate creepy crawlies.\nI might be there still\
  \ had I not taken the precaution of carrying, on a lanyard around my neck, a pochette\
  \ containing a portable metal tapping machine. It buzzed and beeped and I took it\
  \ out and held it in front of me, wonderingly, as if it were a magic box, which,\
  \ in some ways, it is.\n\u201CCalling Mr Key! Calling Mr Key!\u201D\nIn my primitive\
  \ shambling savage state, I was so surprised at the voice issuing from the magic\
  \ box that I dropped it in the duff. The voice grew more urgent, until I picked\
  \ it up and grunted at it.\n\u201CAh, you're there, safely landed I assume?\u201D\
  \nMy brain was a chaos, but suddenly I remembered everything. There was a bitter\
  \ taste in my mouth.\n\u201CAck!\u201D I spat, \u201CI've been eating creepy crawlies\
  \ plucked from tree trunks!\u201D I cried.\n\u201CWell there's no time for that.\
  \ You have twenty-three and a half hours until you are to meet us in the Cow & Pins,\
  \ in your duff coat, with your duff bag. Get cracking! Over and out.\u201D\nNext\
  \ time I conduct an experiment I must remember to appoint a less peremptory research\
  \ team.\nI do not wish to get bogged down in the detail of how I spent the next\
  \ several hours. Let me confess that more than once I prayed to high heaven, wishing\
  \ I were in a provincial town in Belgium rather than in the dark dense forest. It\
  \ is not being melodramatic to say that I knew, more fully than ever before, despair.\
  \ I wept. I howled. I scrabbled in the duff\u2014duff that, far from being wet and\
  \ sticky and holding together at least for a few minutes, as I had imagined, was\
  \ bone dry and frangible and fell through my fingers even as I picked it up from\
  \ the forest floor.\nDo you have any idea how damnably difficult it is to stick\
  \ one tiny fragment of duff to another tiny fragment of duff using only some goo\
  \ that you find smeared here and there on trees and leaves? How tiresome it is when\
  \ you have used up all the available goo and have to go plodding off to find more?\
  \ How in dragging with you your patiently-stuck-together duff-fragments they snag\
  \ on a stray twig and become unstuck and fall apart so you have to begin all over\
  \ again? How the occasional roar of Sabretooth jet fighters screaming across the\
  \ sky over the forest jangles your nerves and makes you a butterfingers?\nWith twenty\
  \ minutes to spare, I trudged into the saloon bar of the Cow & Pins to greet my\
  \ research team. I was dressed in a fetching duff coat and duff pantaloons, with\
  \ a duff cap on my head and duff socks on my feet. I had a duff bag slung over my\
  \ shoulder, empty, because it was too weak to carry any weight.\n\u201CMission accomplished!\u201D\
  \ I yelled.\nIn the corner of the pub, there was a gang of scientists sat around\
  \ a table.\n\u201CLook!\u201D, one piped up, \u201CThe O horizon!\u201D\nAnd they\
  \ sprang up from their chairs and picked me up and carried me off to their science\
  \ van and drove me to their lab, where I have languished ever since, prodded and\
  \ probed and poked at, and fed, now and then, on bitter, bitter creepy crawlies.\n\
