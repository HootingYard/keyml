text: "It is Sabine Baring-Gould Week at Hooting Yard, and today our hero sinks into\
  \ a bog. He is out on Dartmoor with a man called Thomas from the Ordnance Survey.\
  \ As night falls, the pair realise they are hopelessly lost. This passage is quoted\
  \ in William Purcell's biography, but he does not tell us from where in Baring-Gould's\
  \ preposterously profuse writings he has extracted it:\n\u201CThe bog at night exhaled\
  \ a deathlike sickly odour. Not a sound could be heard. No bird was roused, not\
  \ an insect hummed. It was night now; not even a spark, not a Jack o\u2019 Lantern.\
  \ We could no longer see each other, and we had ceased to call to each other. Then\
  \ all at once a fear came over me that we had got into Crowdy Marsh. I had seen\
  \ quite enough of that. It is not composed of peat; it is simply water which is\
  \ slimy with decomposing vegetable matter. It is dangerous to men and fatal to beasts\u2026\
  \n\u201CAll at once I uttered a cry of \u2018Help me\u2019, and sank to my armpits.\
  \ It was instantaneous. I was in water, not on moss; and in sinking all I could\
  \ do was to catch at some particles of floating moss fibre, half-rotten reed and\
  \ water-weed, and rake myself forward with strokes like those of a swimmer till\
  \ I could lay hold of the spongelike surface of moss that formed the skin over the\
  \ quaking bog. The moss was a foot thick, very porous but light, so that it floated\
  \ till saturated with water. In my struggles I drew much of this moss towards me,\
  \ but, as I pressed on it it sank under my weight, became waterlogged, and surrounded\
  \ me, helping to suck me down. Against the wan sky I could see the moss as a mound\
  \ black as ink, which wavered and rolled as I clung to and dragged at it.\n\u201C\
  Finding that my efforts were unavailing, and by this means I could never extricate\
  \ myself, I extended the bamboo I held horizontally, a hand at each extremity, and\
  \ pressed this down on the surface of the moss. By this means I managed to heave\
  \ myself up, and I had just enough power to throw my head and my neck forward on\
  \ the moss, with arms extended like a spider. I felt as if I were striving against\
  \ a gigantic octopus, that was endeavouring with boneless, fleshy arms to drag me\
  \ under water. So great indeed was the suction that the leather gaiters that extended\
  \ to the knee were torn off my legs.\n\u201CHaving thus reached the surface, and\
  \ spread myself upon it, I worked myself along till I arrived at a hassock of coarse\
  \ grass or reed, and on that I planted myself to breathe\u2026 I was quivering in\
  \ every muscle after the supreme strain of wrenching myself out of the mire\u2026\
  \ There was still a long tract of moss very similar in nature to that through part\
  \ of which I had struggled, and I was fain to go through it in the same manner as\
  \ before, writhing along like a lizard.\n\u201CAt length, I came to firm land, exhausted,\
  \ panting, my brow beaded with sweat, yet at the same time conscious of extreme\
  \ cold from immersion. I called again and again\u2026 and soon came up with Thomas.\
  \ The stench of the decomposing matter in my nostrils sickened me. However, a sense\
  \ of relief and exhilaration came over me, and we made our way on till we struck\
  \ a road, and finally reached our inn. I found my purse in my pocket sodden, my\
  \ watch in my waistcoat pocket stopped\u2026\n\u201CI found moss on my left shoulder,\
  \ so that I had sunk that far, and, as I had said, the suction tore my gaiters off\
  \ my legs.\u201D\n[2010-12-07]"
