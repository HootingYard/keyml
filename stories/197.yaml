text: "Pevsner never passed this way, so the building, long abandoned, remains unsung.\
  \ Hidden by elm and yew and larch and sycamore, only ghosts sing here now\u2026\
  \ sing and dance, conjure and tumble, toot and whistle and crack the corniest of\
  \ corny gags you ever did hear. For the crumbling palace of which I speak was once\
  \ Bodger's Spinney Music Hall & Variety Theatre, and it was here that one of the\
  \ most singular careers in entertainment began, and ended.\nLike a character from\
  \ a Gothic novel, Bonkers Maisie was locked up in an attic for forty years. Whether\
  \ her bonkersness was the motive for her confinement, or the inevitable result of\
  \ it, we cannot say. All others who lived at the stinking farmhouse atop which the\
  \ attic loomed are dead and gone, and they left no diaries or memoirs or confessions.\
  \ Indeed, the only book to be recovered from the farm was the novel which was Bonkers\
  \ Maisie's companion for all those years. It was a copy of Iron In The Soul by Jean-Paul\
  \ Sartre.\nOn the night of her rescue, Bonkers Maisie came lolloping down the staircase\
  \ clutching the Sartre in one hand and a moth-eaten stuffed toy bear in the other.\
  \ It was a one-eyed bear, and looked rather like the cloying mascot of the BBC's\
  \ annual Children In Need appeal. It did not have a name. As she passed through\
  \ the door into the open air for the first time in forty years, Bonkers Maisie took\
  \ one rapid, unblinking, uncomprehending look at those who had kept her shut away.\
  \ The soldiers had lined them up against the wall of the pig-sty, blindfolded, their\
  \ necks already bared for the nooses. An owl hooted, and Bonkers Maisie was given\
  \ an already-lit cigarette, and driven away in a jeep at reckless speed.\nOne week\
  \ later posters appeared in Bodger's Spinney announcing an exciting new turn at\
  \ the Music Hall & Variety Theatre. Opening the show for more established acts,\
  \ Bonkers Maisie would take to the stage for half an hour. The advertisement ran\
  \ shy of divulging the precise nature of her performance, so when the local hoi\
  \ polloi peasantry shuffled resentfully into the sawdust-strewn mosh pit, they had\
  \ no inkling of what to expect. With everybody inside, the soldiers slammed shut\
  \ all the doors and set the timer-locks.\nThis was the era of the New Look, and\
  \ when Bonkers Maisie skipped onstage it was obvious that a benefactor had replaced\
  \ her tattered attic rags. She tapped the microphone hesitantly with a gloved fingertip,\
  \ and took from her new expensive Wyck Thayer handbag her spookily pristine copy\
  \ of Iron In The Soul. And beginning very quietly, but gradually getting louder,\
  \ until she was shrieking like a banshee, she read:\nAn octopus? He pulled out his\
  \ knife and opened his eyes \u2026 Rushes of blood to the head settle nothing \u2026\
  \ The abscess had got to be drained \u2026 He'll pretend to agree, so as not to\
  \ look like a pricked bubble, but no sooner is your back turned, than he evaporates\
  \ into thin air \u2026 Brunet was grinding scraps of bread into the ground with\
  \ his heel \u2026 The general mood welled sluggishly up in his mind and oozed from\
  \ his mouth \u2026 Truth stood blocking every vista.\nTo those among the gathered\
  \ peasants who were existentialists familiar with Sartre, it was apparent that Bonkers\
  \ Maisie was plucking phrases from the book at random. To the rest, the words took\
  \ on a haunting grandeur. Some wept. All were transfixed.\nAnd then, after reading\
  \ for fifteen minutes, Bonkers Maisie stopped, put the book back in her handbag,\
  \ sashayed to the side of the stage and came back bearing in her Dior-clad arms\
  \ a large bundle of dishcloths. She spent the next quarter of an hour in complete\
  \ silence, scrunching up the dishcloths one by one, unscrunching them and then scrunching\
  \ them up again. It was not quite a magic show, in fact it was as far from a magic\
  \ show as one could get, yet by the time the emcee tootled his whistle to signal\
  \ that she cease her scrunching, the crowd of rustics was bathed in an aura of absolute\
  \ awe.\nThat season, Bonkers Maisie performed her show every night without a break,\
  \ gradually moving up the billing until she was the star act for the final weekend.\
  \ The morning after her final appearance, it is said that the soldiers came for\
  \ her in their jeep, and drove her away from Bodger's Spinney before dawn. Some\
  \ say they took her to the seaside, and that she lived out the rest of her days\
  \ in tranquility. No one has ever been able to locate her gravestone.\nNote\_: Astute\
  \ and/or pernickety readers may question a certain befuddlement in the chronology\
  \ of the tale of Bonkers Maisie, and of course they are free so to do. I offer no\
  \ defence, except to say that I may have muddled up my source material.\n[2007-06-14]"
