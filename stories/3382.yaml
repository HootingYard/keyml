  Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. Remember,\
  \ too, the case of the distressed pig, solved by Special Agent Blot. The distressed\
  \ pig was found in a rowing boat crossing Tantarabim Lake. Agent Blot swam out to\
  \ it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becalmed Agent Blot took the\
  \ oars and he rowed to the mud-splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of\
  \ the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plodded his way in his wellington\
  \ boots to the pig farmer's hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack\
  \ of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off\
  \ to the prison, bang in the centre of town. And that is why, on November the fifth,\
  \ the distressed pig did not drown.\u201D\nI am pleased to report that the tale\
  \ so briefly told has been expanded, by bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead no less,\
  \ into a thumping great airport bookstall paperback potboiler entitled Special Agent\
  \ Blot And The Distressed Pig!\_: How A Distressed Pig Was Rescued By Special Agent\
  \ Blot!\nIt seems Pebblehead is still managing to avoid the attentions of a copy\
  \ editor. Those exclamation marks in the title are wholly uncalled-for. Obviously\
  \ he is trying to drum up excitement in the casual airport bookstall browser, but\
  \ surely he realises that the name \u201CPebblehead\u201D alone, emblazoned in glittery\
  \ glittering glitz upon the cover, is enough to cause perilous palpitations in the\
  \ hardest of hearts?\nHooting Yard Rating\_: Sweeping & Magisterial\n[2009-11-05]"
