text: "\nOn the occasion of her 184th birthday, I am reminded of my long-abandoned\
  \ project of concocting an entirely new corpus of works by Emily Dickinson, through\
  \ the simple procedure of jumbling up lines from her poems more or less at random.\
  \ Perhaps reviving this scheme will keep me occupied during my (imminent) dotage.\

  \  Between my Curtain and the Wall\n  Had power to mangle me\n[2014-12-10]"
