text: "The other day I had some harsh words to say about the out of print pamphleteer\
  \ Dobson's song-writing skills. \u201CNo one with any sense has ever listened to\
  \ a Dobson song more than once\u201D, I wrote. Well, it seems I was mistaken. I\
  \ was rummaging in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and I came\
  \ upon indisputable evidence that at least one sensible person admired a Dobson\
  \ song so much that they recorded a cover version of it. The song in question is\
  \ one of the pamphleteer's settings from the Book of Isaiah.\nHooting Yard readers\
  \ are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged with letters accusing\
  \ me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in some foolhardy attempt\
  \ to chivvy up Dobson's reputation. I therefore arranged for a local snapper to\
  \ take a snapshot of what I found, as proof. \n\nam now going to have to go and\
  \ lie down in a darkened, cork-panelled room while I mull over what this extraordinary\
  \ artefact tells us about (a) Dobson, and (b) Tiny Enid.\nThanks, by the way, to\
  \ boynton.\n[2007-06-15]"
