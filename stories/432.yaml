text: "\u201CBlack hair announces cowardice and great craftiness, excessively yellow\
  \ and pale white hair, such as the Scythians and Celts have, reveals ignorance and\
  \ clumsiness and wildness, and that which is gently yellow points towards an aptitude\
  \ for learning, gentleness, and skill in art. Unmixed fiery hair like the flower\
  \ of a pomegranate is not good, since for the most part their characters are beastlike\
  \ and shameless and greedy. Legs which are very hairy with thick black hair indicate\
  \ slowness at learning and wildness. Those whose loins and thighs have lots of hair\
  \ separately from the other parts of the body are very lascivious.\u201D\nQuoted\
  \ in The Philosophy Of Physiognomy\n[2008-05-20]"
