text: "In a piece marking the death, at 85, of General Alexander Haig, Christopher\
  \ Hitchens described the fifty-ninth US Secretary of State as a \u201Cslobbering\
  \ dauphin\u201D. This phrase will be more familiar to Hooting Yard readers as the\
  \ one commonly used to refer to Prince Fulgencio's sickly, pipsqueak son and heir,\
  \ whose official title was His Luminous Magnificence The Princeling Balthazar Clovis\
  \ Agamemnon De Pig De Pig Of Oogah And Sluice In The Islands Of Widdecombe Sound.\
  \ That was what it said on his badge. But everybody, including Prince Fulgencio\
  \ himself, called him the slobbering dauphin, when they were talking about him or,\
  \ indeed, talking to him.\nA typical exchange might go as follows:\nPrince Fulgencio\_\
  : Good grief! Ever since we arrived here at Fort Hoity where I am to review my trooplets\
  \ and cut a princely dash, you, slobbering dauphin, have been slobbering away and\
  \ quite taking the shine off my regal jib.\nThe Princeling\_: Slobber slobber slobber.\n\
  Prince Fulgencio\_: There, you are at it again! Yes, slobbering dauphin, I am slapping\
  \ my forehead hard, for you leave me at my wits\u2019 end. Perhaps it is your forehead\
  \ I ought to be slapping, if I did not think doing so would make you slobber all\
  \ the more!\nThe Princeling\_: Slobber slobber slobber.\nPrince Fulgencio\_: There\
  \ is only one thing for it! While I remain here at Fort Hoity I must have you out\
  \ of my sight, so you must go to Fort Toity, a mile or two yonder across the glinka,\
  \ and stay put. You may take a little groupuscule of henchpersons with you. Now\
  \ hie thee hence, slobbering dauphin!\nThus is explained the otherwise puzzling\
  \ fact that the spindly and sickly and slobbering dauphin found himself, that long\
  \ hot summer, in sole command of Fort Toity. Freed from the repressive influence\
  \ of his loathsome Papa, the Princeling's slobberings grew fewer, and on some days\
  \ he barely slobbered at all. Though there was, at Fort Toity as at Fort Hoity,\
  \ a full complement of domestic staff, he spent much of his time in the first few\
  \ days buffing the crenellations with a rag, until they glistened. When this activity\
  \ exhausted his weedy constitution, the Princeling sprawled pallid and wan upon\
  \ cushions, on a balcony, gazing for hours at the desolate glinka, with its few\
  \ scattered clumps of lightning-blasted shrubbery and, dotted here and there, yawning\
  \ pits of doom into which would topple, from time to time, such small blind stupid\
  \ furry creatures as had strayed from their nestings and burrows in search of food.\
  \ The sun was immense, and golden.\nIn his paperback potted biography of the Princeling,\
  \ Pebblehead is at pains to point out that the slobbering dauphin's balcony cushions\
  \ were uncomfortable, and thus that his lolling upon them for untold hours was a\
  \ kind of penitence. But penitence for what? Pebblehead does not say, at least not\
  \ explicitly. At the time of the Fort Toity summer, the Princeling was but a pipsqueak\
  \ youth, and had not the years behind him to have drummed up the kind of catalogue\
  \ of crimes other writers have imputed to him, confusing him perhaps with his black-hearted\
  \ father, or even perhaps with the deranged killer Babinsky, to whom, in later life,\
  \ when he had grown an impressive walrus moustache, the Princeling bore more than\
  \ a passing resemblance. Indeed, it became a tactic of Babinsky's, whenever the\
  \ coppers were closing in on him, to slobber, the better to outwit them. Certainly\
  \ we have not one whit of evidence that the slobbering dauphin was involved in the\
  \ series of outrages that took place in and around the glinka in the months before\
  \ he was installed at Fort Toity. In any case, even had he harboured a desire to\
  \ wipe out great swathes of peasantry, how likely is it that he would have crept\
  \ about from place to place poisoning wells, when all he need do, as Princeling,\
  \ was to drop a word in his father's ear? Prince Fulgencio was always looking for\
  \ any excuse to issue a ukase to his henchpersons and to have them clattering about\
  \ the place on their fine ferocious horses bringing death and ruination in their\
  \ wake. That was the kind of Prince he was, those the kind of henchpersons.\nIt\
  \ is possible that Pebblehead mistranslated the ancient documents, getting \u201C\
  uncomfortable cushions\u201D where he ought to have had \u201Cgorgeous embroidered\
  \ pillows stuffed with duck down and a new kind of foam material soft as marshmallow\u201D\
  . The Princeling's own jottings give no sense that he was consumed by guilt and\
  \ the desire for uncomfortable cushion penitence, though they are difficult to read,\
  \ because his slobbering was always at its most slobbery when he was writing, even\
  \ during that blazing Fort Toity summer, when he slobbered less in general.\nThere\
  \ was an amusing fashion, for a brief period in the latter half of the last century,\
  \ for wealthy beat music combos to decamp to chateaux, there to engage in the dual\
  \ activities of high debauch and the waxing of their latest disc. As we know full\
  \ well, there is nothing new under the sun, that immense and golden orb that beat\
  \ down, once, upon the desolate glinka and upon the balcony where the slobbering\
  \ dauphin sprawled upon his cushions. And one blazing noon, his brain grown hot,\
  \ the Princeling had a sudden thought, and clapped his hands to summon a henchperson.\n\
  The Princeling\_: Today I am able to stop slobbering long enough to speak coherently,\
  \ Arpad. [For the henchperson's name was Arpad.] My brain is hot, and I have a sudden\
  \ thought. I want you to go bustling about the villages on the edges of the glinka\
  \ and round up some musicians. Players on the sackbut and shawm and pipe and drum\
  \ and what have you. Bring them to me, at once!\nArpad : It will be enacted, O slobbering\
  \ dauphin.\nArpad the henchperson was a frighteningly efficient fellow, and no sooner\
  \ had he been given his orders than he was off, on a cart drawn by several horses\
  \ borrowed from Prince Fulgencio's magnificent horsery at Fort Hoity. As Pebblehead\
  \ pointed out, for all his evil ways, Prince Fulgencio had done much to eradicate\
  \ sickness among his steeds, and the Fort Hoity horsery proudly proclaimed itself\
  \ to be free of glanders, headshaking, lethal white syndrome, mud fever, contagious\
  \ equine metritis, rainscald, strangles, quiltor, hereditary equine regional dermal\
  \ asthenia, choke, grass sickness, recurrent airway obstruction, cerebellar abiotrophy,\
  \ lavender foal syndrome, pythiosis, poll evil, and many another common horse disease.\
  \ So healthy and vigorous were the horses pulling his cart that Arpad made the rounds\
  \ of the villages in a single afternoon, and returned to Fort Toity at dusk with\
  \ various sackbuttists and shawmists and pipers and drummers, to the unbridled delight\
  \ of the Princeling, who cut some capers and slobbered, and rewarded Arpad with\
  \ a personal picnic basket.\nSo happy was the Princeling that his slobbering became\
  \ uncontrollable, and he had to write down his instructions for the musicians, with\
  \ Arpad at his side mopping the slobber into a cup so it did not drip upon the vellum.\
  \ Although the original is lost, Pebblehead was able to reconstruct the Princeling's\
  \ scribble using the technique known as \u201Cboggle-eyed hallucinatory scribble\
  \ reconstruction\u201D, sitting in a darkened room kept at a constant chill, and\
  \ with beetles scurrying across the floor. The bestselling paperbackist actually\
  \ wrote two entirely different versions, because he was enjoying himself so much,\
  \ but only one is suitable for family reading. According to Pebblehead, this is\
  \ what the slobbering dauphin wrote:\nWhile I was buffing the crenellations with\
  \ a rag, and more so when I was just lying sprawled on cushions on the balcony gazing\
  \ upon the desolation of the glinka, all the while I have been hearing noises in\
  \ my head. Noises, I say? No, music, the music of the spheres, or at least between\
  \ my ears. Now, I charge you raggle-taggle band of players to make this music known\
  \ to the world outside my head, so others, including Arpad here, and the other henchpersons,\
  \ and my father's majestic horses, and the domestic staff, and all who dwell in\
  \ Fort Toity, and beyond, beyond the glinka, in the villages from whence you came,\
  \ and elsewhere, may hear it. For it is music destined to be immortal. It will outlast\
  \ me, as it will outlast my terrible reproachful father, Prince Fulgencio, as it\
  \ will outlast even you, who play it. For I command also Arpad, with or without\
  \ the help of his fellow henchpersons, to devise, from polished magnetic pebbles\
  \ and pointy bits of tin and interlocking wheels and belts made from the stretchy\
  \ sinewy guts of badgers and the like, an engine to entrap and then to recreate\
  \ this music, over and over again, so you need no longer play it and may begone\
  \ from Fort Toity and return to your villages. So, begin to play upon your sackbuts\
  \ and shawms and pipes and drums, and I will direct and guide you by gesticulation\
  \ of my arms and legs and movements of my brow, and by slobbering.\nThe music thus\
  \ created, by fits and starts and with much agon, sounded remarkably like the genre\
  \ we know today as \u201Csmooth death metal\u201D. Before summer's end, it was blasted\
  \ by Arpad's engine across the glinka, from dawn to dusk, occasionally jaunty, sometimes\
  \ pounding, but mostly just smooth and deathly and metallic, just as the slobbering\
  \ dauphin heard it inside his head.\nBut the summer ended, as summers will, and\
  \ one morning Prince Fulgencio came to Fort Toity, roaring his head off, on horseback,\
  \ flanked by a trooplet of brutish henchpersons.\nPrince Fulgencio\_: Well, slobbering\
  \ dauphin, I have shut up Fort Hoity for the bleaker months, and am set upon a long\
  \ and arduous journey to Castle Blunkett, there to hole up for the winter tormenting\
  \ the peasantry and eradicating disease among the horses and guide dogs. I wish\
  \ you to accompany me, for so vast is the castle that you can have your own wing\
  \ to slobber in, slobber as you will.\nThe Princeling\_:\_ Slobber slobber slobber.\n\
  Then came a wind such as swept across the glinka on autumnal mornings, a bitter\
  \ wind. Arpad helped the weedy Princeling up on to a horse, and off he rode, slobbering\
  \ onto the horse's magnificent shining mane, riding into the wind.\n[2010-04-07]"
