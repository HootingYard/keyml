text: "Where Eagles Dare is a 1968 film starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, and\
  \ Mary Ure, based on the 1967 novel by Alistair MacLean, who also wrote the screenplay.\
  \ It is also the title of a late pamphlet by Dobson.\nDobson's Where Eagles Dare\
  \ was written at the prompting of Marigold Chew, who hoped that by scribbling away\
  \ at length the pamphleteer could overcome his preposterous obsession with the film.\
  \ Students of Dobson's dotage will recall that he took to wearing a snowsuit and\
  \ cobbled together a walkie-talkie system out of paper cups and string. For weeks\
  \ on end his only communication with Marigold Chew was to stretch the string to\
  \ its full extent, so that for example he was in the pantry when Marigold Chew was\
  \ in the front garden, or vice versa, and to declaim \u201CBroadsword to Danny Boy\u2026\
  \ Broadsword to Danny Boy\u201D into his paper cup.\nDobson's mania was given further\
  \ fuel by the coincidental fact that, for many years, Marigold Chew's party piece\
  \ had been an exquisitely accurate impersonation of Michael Hordern. Her voice was\
  \ of course somewhat higher pitched than that of the actor, but she used a Japanese\
  \ funnel to lower it, and caught his distracted mannerisms perfectly.\nAs weeks\
  \ turned to months, and Dobson's foolishness showed no sign of abating\u2014he had,\
  \ for example, taken to referring to their house as the Schloss Adler \u2013 Marigold\
  \ Chew became desperate. She consulted a local bird counting person who arranged\
  \ for a multitude of wrens to flock around the house, thinking to simulate the conditions\
  \ in The Tragedy of King Richard the third. Containing, His treacherous Plots against\
  \ his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall\
  \ vsurpation: with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserued death,\
  \ where \u201Cthe world is grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare\
  \ not perch\u201D.\nThis only served to encourage Dobson, and so, at her wit's end,\
  \ Marigold Chew reasoned that the writing of a pamphlet might be the answer. It\
  \ was characteristic of Dobson that his many fads and enthusiasms sputtered out\
  \ once he had written about them. And so it proved, once again. But what are we\
  \ to make of his Where Eagles Dare today? It is impossible to say, for not a single\
  \ copy has ever been tracked down. Indeed, some think it never existed in the first\
  \ place, and is a mere chimera, although a chimera of a particularly Dobsonian kidney.\n\
  One small footnote. There is an amusing note in Marigold Chew's diary, from the\
  \ same period, where she writes: \u201CThe Great Escape is showing at the local\
  \ Excelsior. I have sent Dobson to a remote seaside resort for the duration of its\
  \ run. One cannot be too careful.\u201D\n[2007-03-04]"
