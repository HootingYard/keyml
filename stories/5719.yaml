text: "\u201CIt occurred to a medical man some years ago that the uniform atmosphere\
  \ of this cave might be a specific for consumption.\n\u201CPossessed with this theory,\
  \ the doctor had a dozen small houses constructed in the cavern, about a mile or\
  \ two from its mouth, and to these he conveyed his patients. From the appearance\
  \ of these places of abode, the only wonder is that the poor invalids did not expire\
  \ after twenty-four hours of residence in them. They, however, contrived to exist\
  \ there about three months, most of them being carried out in extremis. The houses\
  \ consisted of a single room, built of the rough stone of the cavern,\u2014which,\
  \ in this part, bears all the appearance of a stone-quarry,\u2014and without one\
  \ particle of comfort beyond a boarded floor, the small dwelling being constructed\
  \ entirely on the model of a lock-up, or \u2018stone-jug\u2019. The cells of a modern\
  \ prison are quite palatial in comparison with them. The darkness is such as might\
  \ be felt; and it is impossible to realize what darkness actually is until experienced\
  \ in some place where a ray of sunlight has never penetrated\u2026\n\u201CThe houses\u2014\
  or rather detached stone boxes\u2014were so small that without vitiating the air\
  \ only one person could remain in them at one time; so that, besides the darkness,\u2014\
  in case of any accident to their lamps,\u2014these poor creatures must have endured\
  \ utter solitude. Their food was brought from the hotel, two or three miles away,\
  \ on the hill, and consequently must have been cold and comfortless. They were kept\
  \ prisoners within their narrow cells, for the rough rocks and stones everywhere\
  \ abounding rendered a promenade for invalids quite impracticable. The deprivation\
  \ of sunlight, fresh air, and all the beauties of the earth must have been the direst\
  \ punishment imaginable. No wonder these poor creatures were carried out one by\
  \ one to die.\n\u201CThe last one having become so weak that it was deemed unsafe\
  \ to move him, his friends resolved to stay with him in the cavern till the last.\
  \ What transpired is now beyond investigation. Whether some effect of light, which\
  \ in this cavern has a most mysterious and awful appearance, or whether the death-bed\
  \ was one of terrors, owing to some imp of mischief having laid a plan to \u2018\
  scare\u2019 them, as they say in this country, is not known; but they rushed terror-stricken\
  \ from the cave, and on reaching the hotel fell down insensible. Subsequently they\
  \ declared they had seen spirits carrying away their friend. Mustering a strong\
  \ force, the people from terra firma, with the guides and plenty of torches, sallied\
  \ down to the lower and supposed infernal regions. The spirits, however, had fled,\
  \ leaving nothing but the stiffening corpse of the poor consumptive. This ended\
  \ all hope of the cavern as a cure for consumption.\u201D\nTh\xE9r\xE8se Yelverton,\
