text: "Quite often, a farmer will choose to give one of his cows the name Buttercup.\
  \ This is lost on the cow itself, which is too stupid to understand the concept\
  \ of names for things. When a cow gazes upon the world it is as if through a dense\
  \ mental fog. We can go some way to replicating this, even with our much mightier\
  \ brain power. For instance, I once spent a morning\u2014a misty morning\u2014standing\
  \ in a field, chewing on a mouthful of uprooted grass, staring straight ahead, and\
  \ emptying my mind of all and any stimulus, using a technique I learned from a witch\
  \ doctor. It was a salutary experience, and afterwards I felt I had a much greater\
  \ understanding of the interior world of a cow. I continued the experiment by asking\
  \ people to call me Buttercup, to see if I would respond when my name was spoken\
  \ aloud. I did not so respond, on that day or on any day thereafter. If somebody\
  \ called out, in my hearing, \u201COi! Mr Key!\u201D, my ears would prick up and\
  \ I would look around for whomsoever had called my name, and, when I spotted them,\
  \ raise an eyebrow and answer \u201CYes, what is it you want, my good fellow?\u201D\
  \ or, as it may be, \u201Cmy good woman?\u201D, or even \u201Cyoung urchin?\u201D\
  \ But I found that when somebody yelled \u201CButtercup! Buttercup!\u201D my immediate\
  \ reaction was to assume I had fallen among florists.\nIt can be quite unnerving\
  \ to fall among florists, particularly when there is a gang of them. They tend to\
  \ hold, in their clenched fists, bunches of buttercups or daffodils or god alone\
  \ knows how many different types of flowers, and they will thrust them under your\
  \ nose while holding out the open palm of their free hand in expectation of coinage.\
  \ The idea is that you give them money and in return they present you with the bunch\
  \ of buttercups, or whatever. But when there is a whole sussuration of florists\
  \ surrounding you, each importuning you, it is no easy matter to pick one out of\
  \ the crowd and to buy his sprig in preference to any other sprig, and it is unlikely\
  \ you are carrying enough cash to be able to afford all the blooms thrust at you.\
  \ Whenever I fall among florists in this manner, I remember the lessons I learned\
  \ from the witch doctor, and I assume the mien of a cow. Usually, but not always,\
  \ the florists will disperse.\nIf the florists do not disperse, the best idea is\
  \ to snap out of your cow-trance and to shake a stick at them, the more wildly the\
  \ better, accompanying the wild shaking of the stick with blood-curdling screams.\
  \ Production of such screams can also be taught to you by any witch doctor worth\
  \ their salt.\nIf you intend to eat a dish of buttercups, either raw or cooked,\
  \ do not garnish them with salt. If, on the other hand, you have it in mind to eat\
  \ a cow called Buttercup, a sprinkle of salt does not go amiss, and will make the\
  \ meat more palatable. For vegetarians, a cow made out of marzipan is an acceptable\
  \ substitute, but here again, as with the buttercups, it should be innocent of a\
  \ salt seasoning.\nNever eat buttercups in the presence of a florist.\n[2015-02-05]"
