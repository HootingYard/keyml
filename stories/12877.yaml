text: "The year is 1982, the scene is the Jacquard Club in Norwich. On the bill for\
  \ the evening's entertainment are Serious Drinking, a band composed of middle class\
  \ university graduates who do a reasonably convincing job of pretending to be working\
  \ class oiks. Their songs are mostly about beer and foopball. Their EP Love On The\
  \ Terraces is a collector's item these days. Also taking to the stage is a post-punk\
  \ performance poet. Incapable of memorising his verses, he has them scribbled on\
  \ pieces of paper which, as he finishes reading each one, he scrunches up in his\
  \ fist and chucks into the audience. Nobody knows\u2014indeed nobody cares\u2014\
  that this will be his one and only performance as a poet, and he will not reappear\
  \ on stage until the new century has dawned. He shouts (among other things):\nI\
  \ spent ten days in a shed\n  The shed was made of wood\n  I smoked a pack of Number\
  \ 6\n  And drank a bottle of stout\n  I didn't eat a fucking crumb\n  After a while\
  \ my legs went numb\n  Then I went and had my bath\n  Now I'm so clean it almost\
  \ hurts\nThat youthful performer was Frank Key The Poet. I am not sure what brought\
  \ that memory flooding back.\nADDENDUM\_: I recall only one other piece I shouted\
  \ at the crowd that night, and only the opening three lines come back to me:\nHe\
  \ pushed a boy scout into a lake\n  Went to a snackbar and stole some cake\n  He's\
  \ a snackbar hooligan!\nAll the verses followed the same pattern, a rhyming couplet\
  \ followed by the one-line \u201Cchorus\u201D, after each bellowing of which I urged\
  \ the audience to shout \u201CYeah!\u201D or \u201COi!\u201D, which I am pleased\
  \ to say they did, with a certain mocking enthusiasm.\n[2014-07-29]"
