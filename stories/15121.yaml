  me if the answer is blindingly obvious.

  What, I would like to know, is the quality inherent in the excrement expelled by
  bats that is related to human madness? I am thinking of the phrase batshit crazy.
  We do not commonly say, for example, catshit crazy or giraffeshit crazy or puff-addershit
  crazy, or at least I have not heard these phrases used at the sort of swish sophisticated
  cocktail parties I try to barge my way into. But reference to the droppings of bats
  is made frequently.

  Answers in the Comments please, unless you are batshit crazy yourself, in which
  case you would be more appropriately occupied reading something by Will Self.
