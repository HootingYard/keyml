text: "\nNot only had Minnie taken the alarm-clock and thrown it into a canal, she\
  \ had also laced Lars Talc's bedtime drink with a powerful sedative. He woke assuming\
  \ it was late on Friday morning and dawdled about the apartment sharpening pencils,\
  \ putting hay under the chairs, stamping on beetles, smearing foul-smelling decoctions\
  \ on to his luxuriant hairstyle, gnashing his teeth, tinkering with a plastic fruitbat\
  \ decoy, painting hurdles, winnowing chaff, hooting, chomping a surfeit of lampreys,\
  \ and docking a hare.\nThe telegram, delivered by the efficient Finnish postal service,\
  \ arrived as he was in the middle of straightening his doilies. It was from Bewg.\n\
  \u201CTwo hours left to claim prize,\u201D it read, \u201CIf crate not opened, massive\
  \ explosion will result. You and everything else within five-hundred-yards radius\
  \ will be obliterated.\u201D\nTwo hours? Talc switched on his radio and, after enduring\
  \ three and a half minutes of windy Sumatran jazz, was informed that it was three\
  \ and a half minutes past ten on Saturday morning. Imagine his bafflement. Picture\
  \ him stalking through his rooms, locating Minnie, prising the truth from her, and\
  \ falling into a swoon. He comes to, wails, and attempts to focus his throbbing\
  \ brain on these unsuspected developments. It is twenty-four hours later than he\
  \ thought, and the tiny zinc crate is booby-trapped.\nMinnie is detailed to stand\
  \ by with a stop-watch. She records the sequence of events in her commonplace book.\n\
  10.14\_: Tiny crate removed from pocket of blazer. Talc emitting persistent stream\
  \ of curses. He attempts to smash the crate open. Agents\_: hammer, awl, adze, side\
  \ of table, fists, jemmy, iron mallet, edge of cabinet, crowbar, knife, sword, fork,\
  \ divers implements, slab.\n10.28\_: Talc sobbing.\n10.29\_: The englantilainen\
  \ Snodgrass brings vestments. He has darned them. He says he has an appointment.\
  \ Talc is all snarls and hisses. Snodgrass demands refreshments. I proffer jam and\
  \ ale, which Snodgrass wolfs down, explaining that he has not eaten for days. Talc\
  \ is hunched in the corner of the room, armed with a dirk, the tiny zinc crate wedged\
  \ between torn-up floorboards. Snodgrass demands more jam. Talc takes exception\
  \ to him, and manhandles him roughly. Snodgrass threatens to call the police. Talc\
  \ bashes him on the head with a large wooden kitchen utensil and shoves him into\
  \ a cupboard, which he locks, throwing the key out of the window.\n10.46\_: Talc\
  \ moans much.\n10.49\_: The crate is severely dented. Talc has been hitting it with\
  \ the handle of a torch for three minutes.\n10.50\_: There is a pounding upon the\
  \ door. Screeching horribly, Talc commands me to ignore it. In a steady voice, as\
  \ if I were reading a railway timetable, I inform him that he has one hour and ten\
  \ minutes left. He makes use of colourful language, at which I am sufficiently offended\
  \ to stamp my feet and slouch off to the table-tennis room to sulk. The pounding\
  \ at the door continues.\n10.54\_: Bruno joins me for a game of ping pong. As we\
  \ play, we chuckle together at the increasingly ludicrous noises emanating from\
  \ the pantry.\n11.02\_: I am 15\u201311 ahead on points. Bathed in sweat, crackling\
  \ with fury, Talc bursts in and interrupts our game. I tell him he is pungent. Bruno,\
  \ who fears him, slinks out despite my protests. Talc places the tiny crate on the\
  \ ping pong table. At some point in the last ten minutes he has donned a suit of\
  \ protective clothing. He looks not unlike a bee-keeping enthusiast. In ringing\
  \ tones, he raps out a list of apparatus he wishes me to fetch. Aluminium netting!\
  \ Spatula! Titanium batteries! Gutta-percha chocks! Flamethrower! Spindle! Hooter!\
  \ I point out that there has been no let-up in the pounding at the door, which is\
  \ now increasing in vigour. Plastic nozzles! Coddington lens! Piping! Magnetic ring!\
  \ Taut wiring! Pot of milk! Bungee! Flint snappers! Ratchets! Timber! Wing-nuts!\
  \ Suction tubes! Rubber knobs! [Ad nauseam.] The pounding becomes ever more violent,\
  \ until at last the door gives way.\n11.06\_: A man enters the room. He is of indeterminate\
  \ age, bedraggled, seething, and accompanied by a Finnish police officer. The latter\
  \ takes a keen interest in the apparatus collected upon the ping pong table. Talc,\
  \ who is making careful adjustments to the equipment, ignores their presence. The\
  \ man complains that, as he walked along the street past our building, the key which\
  \ Talc hurled from the window landed with a thud upon his head, quite discombobulating\
  \ him. The police officer, who witnessed the incident, has accompanied him to our\
  \ dwelling in order to arrest the malefactor. Talc spits.\n11.07\_: The police officer,\
  \ herself an amateur scientist, has become enormously fascinated by Talc's activities,\
  \ and is now assisting him in his work. I pat the key-struck man on the head, place\
  \ a Finnish banknote into his hand, and usher him from the apartment with soothing\
  \ words. As he leaves, he gives the key back to me, but I decide to leave Snodgrass\
  \ confined to the cupboard for the time being.\n11.10\_: Fifty minutes to go, I\
  \ announce. I apprise the police officer of our dilemma. She is doughty. She does\
  \ not flee.\n11.14\_: The conglomeration of equipment is now ready. Talc tests it\
  \ by subjecting a biscuit tin to a barrage of noisy experiments. Jagged bolts of\
  \ electricity shoot forth. Gases hiss. Liquids bubble. The biscuit tin cracks open.\
  \ Talc and the police officer mop their brows, shake hands, and smile through gritted\
  \ teeth.\n11.20\_: Bruno, quizzical, pokes his head in, but retreats.\n11.21\_:\
  \ Talc attaches a pin to his siphon. The police\n[Page missing.]\nmore jam. The\
  \ minutes are ticking away.\n11.49\_: The crate is sturdier than the biscuit tin.\
  \ Indeed, it is formidable. It has now withstood three separate attempts to crack\
  \ it open. The police officer has set all the dials to maximum. The mechanisms,\
  \ which hummed gently, are now growling. I suggest that we call it a day, gather\
  \ our most precious belongings, and seek refuge in a distant spinney. This is met\
  \ with quiet ferocity. Talc and the police officer bare their fangs and continue\
  \ mucking about with the equipment.\n11.54\_: The postman delivers a rebuff from\
  \ the Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum Committee regarding Talc's ticket designs.\n\
  11.55\_: I gather my most precious belongings in a tote bag, bid farewell to Talc\
  \ and the police officer, and, with Bruno in tow, step out into the street. It is\
  \ pouring with rain, as ever. There is a clap of thunder. Bruno and I make for the\
  \ bus stop.\n11.57\_: The bus arrives. The driver is in a foul mood, and refuses\
  \ to allow us aboard, on account of Bruno's apparel. Yes, I say, there is no doubt\
  \ that his clothing offends the senses, he's a proper caution, but you really must\
  \ \u2013\n11.58\_: I am in the middle of my sentence when a lightning bolt crashes\
  \ through a skylight into a building behind us. I notice that it is our building.\
  \ Instinctively, I run back. I meet Talc on the stairs. He is grinning like a maniac.\
  \ The lightning bolt has smashed open the tiny zinc crate, divulging the prize,\
  \ which Talc now holds aloft in his scorched right hand. His hair is afire. I lead\
  \ him to a fountain and douse the flames.\n12.00\_: We return to the apartment.\
  \ The police officer is gibbering, but unhurt. Blasted by lightning, the table-tennis\
  \ room is in a state of devastation. We release Snodgrass from the cupboard, crack\
  \ open a bottle of penk, and carouse, carouse.\n[2017-10-14]"
