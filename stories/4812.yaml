text: "Last week I quoted the views of Colonel Sibthorp, M.P. for Lincoln, on the\
  \ Great Exhibition of 1851. And lo!, now I have come across him again, for Colonel\
  \ Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp has a chapter entire to himself in the late John\
  \ Michell's splendid book Eccentric Lives And Peculiar Notions (1984).\n\u201CDuring\
  \ his many years in the House of Commons, Colonel Sibthorp made his name as the\
  \ most conservative Member of Parliament ever known, setting a standard of reaction,\
  \ nationalism and xenophobia unrivalled in parliamentary history. He opposed every\
  \ change and innovation, regarding even the mildest reform as a fundamental attack\
  \ on his idol, the English Constitution of his youth.\u201D\nPrior to his election,\
  \ asked if he would support reform, he replied:\n\u201COn no account would I sanction\
  \ any attempts to subvert that glorious fabric, our matchless Constitution, which\
  \ has reached its present perfection by the experience of ages, by any new-fangled\
  \ schemes which interested or deluded individuals might bring forward, and those\
  \ who expect any advantages from such notions will find their visions go like a\
  \ vapour and vanish into nothing.\u201D\n\u201CAs his indignation flourished,\u201D\
  \ says Michell, \u201Cso did his powers of oratory. His emphatic speeches against\
  \ anything new or foreign delighted the House of Commons and made him their popular\
  \ favourite. The things he disapproved of were always \u2018Humbugs\u2019 , and\
  \ his repetitions of this and other familiar terms of abuse were greeted with roars\
  \ of parliamentary laughter. His dress was as old-fashioned as his opinions, usually\
  \ consisting of a bottle-green frock-coat and wide white trousers hoisted high above\
  \ his top-boots in the Regency manner. His wispy beard, tall white hat and antique\
  \ quizzing glasses on a cord distinguished him from all other Members\u2026\n\u201C\
  Colonel Sibthorp was obviously very loyal to the Monarchy, but in his eyes Queen\
  \ Victoria had committed one terrible blunder: she had married a foreigner. He always\
  \ referred to such people as \u2018hypocritical foreigners\u2019, implying that\
  \ they were not merely unfortunate but in some way sinister through having been\
  \ born outside Britain. Prince Albert, he allowed, had some admirable qualities,\
  \ but his character was permanently impaired by the fact of his foreign birth\u2026\
  \n\u201CThe coming of the railways provided Colonel Sibthorp with the subject which\
  \ grew obsessive during his later years. Beginning with the announcement that he\
  \ had no intention of ever riding in the \u2018steam humbug;, he opposed all railway\
  \ bills in principle and detail. The new \u2018degrading form of transport\u2019\
  , he foresaw, would bring all sorts of disasters to its patrons, from moral ruin\
  \ to wholesale slaughter. He kept an eye on the newspapers for reports of railway\
  \ accidents, and accused the steam companies of playing down the gory details of\
  \ crashes\u2026\n\u201CChristopher Sykes, who has written affectionately about Sibthorp,\
  \ says that Dostoievski used to read English parliamentary reports, and took Colonel\
  \ Sibthorp as his model for Lebedev, the character in The Idiot who proclaimed that\
  \ the network of railways spreading across holy Russia was the baleful \u2018star\
  \ called Wormwood\u2019 prophesied in the Book of Revelation.\u201D\n[2010-07-21]"
