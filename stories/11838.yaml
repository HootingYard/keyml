  \ number of chickens slaughtered daily worldwide. Nige addressed the important topic\
  \ of chicken sexing. And in the paper the other day I learned of a play entitled,\
  \ brilliantly, Knives In Hens. I am not a theatre-going person, so I had never heard\
  \ of this \u201Cbrutal fable set in a timeless spartan rural community\u201D, but\
