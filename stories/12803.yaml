text: 'Back in February I announced the forthcoming book Mr Key''s Shorter Potted
  Brief, Brief Lives. You lot have no doubt been panting with spittle-flecked anticipation
  ever since, impatiently awaiting the day when you can sashay into your nearest bookshop
  and buy dozens of copies for family, friends, and semiliterate hobbledehoys you
  encounter in the queue at the soup kitchen.

  Alas! What with one thing and another, unbeknown to me, Constable have decided to
  postpone publication until September 2015. To ensure that your Christmas is not
  thereby ruined, I will try my best to issue a brand new Lulu paperback for the festive
  season. Watch this space.
