text: "\nThis is the Venerable Mother Jer\xF3nima de la Fuente, painted by Vel\xE1\
  zquez in 1620. She posed for him while passing through Seville on her way to Manila\
  \ in the Philippines where she was to found a convent. The Venerable Mother was\
  \ renowned for her particularly austere programme of penitence, one which might\
  \ not go amiss for some of today's unruly hoi polloi. Apparently, she was given\
  \ to re-enacting the crucifixion by attaching herself to a cross and hanging upside\
  \ down, like a bat in\_ a cave, for up to three hours at a time.\nYou can go and\
  \ prostrate yourself in spiritual abandonment before the Venerable Mother at the\
  \ National Gallery's exhibition The Sacred Made Real, until January next year. There\
  \ are twenty-nine other works to see, all of them utterly marvellous. Catholicism\
  \ has never been so passionate and gruesome.\n[2009-11-08]"
