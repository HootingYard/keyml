text: "From The Times in 1833, enthusing about the new hydro-oxygen microscope:\n\u201C\
  It can, in truth represent objects five hundred thousand times larger in size than\
  \ they really are. Thus the pores of the slenderest twig and the fibres of the most\
  \ delicate leaf expand into coarse net work. The external integuments of a fly's\
  \ eye, filled with thousands of lenses, appear the dimensions of a lady's veil\u2014\
  that gentleman yclept the flea, swells into six feet\u2014worms seem like boa constrictors:\
  \ while the population of a drop of goodly ditch water presents such shapes as Teniers\
  \ should have seen before he pencilled the grotesque monsters who troubled the sleep\
  \ of St Anthony.\u201D\nQuoted in The Sun And The Moon\_: The Remarkable True Account\
