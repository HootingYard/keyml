  \nThis is the opening line of Dennis Beerpint's latest piece of poetical whimsy.\
  \ Indeed, it is the only line, for the twee versifier has had a fit of the vapours\
  \ and put down his pencil. He is pallid, and shaking, and staring wild-eyed into\
  \ the grate where a few sticks are burning weakly. He wonders if his talent has\
  \ been dissipated by his newfound devotion to buzzing around in a light aircraft,\
  \ swooping low over clumps of cows in fields and calling to them in a language they\
  \ do not understand. Will Dennis get a grip? Can he salvage his poetic gift? Or\
  \ will he dash out his brains on a paving slab? Don't miss the exciting new 26-part\
  \ television drama series Twee Poet In A Light Aircraft Swooping Upon Cows.\n[2007-11-22]"
