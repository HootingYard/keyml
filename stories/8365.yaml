text: "And lo!, we come to the two thousandth postage at Hooting Yard. (Two thousand,\
  \ that is, in the current format. There are an additional nine-hundred-and-fifty\
  \ or so postages in the 2003\_-2006 Archive.) I suggested divers methods of celebration\
  \ when we hit one thousand, so you might want to go and read that.\nNow there are\
  \ so many posts that, were each one a year, they would stretch back as near as dammit\
  \ to the birth of Christ, I am minded to mark two thousand more quietly. Hooting\
  \ Yard is, I hope, quite clearly a place for those intoxicated by love of words.\
  \ So what better way to celebrate than with a quotation containing an extraordinary,\
  \ and sadly neglected, coinage?\nI retired myselfe among the merrie muses, and by\
  \ the worke of my pen and inke, have dezinkhornifistibulated a fantasticall Rapsody\
  \ of dialogisme, to the end that I would not be found an idle drone among so many\
  \ famous teachers and professors of noble languages.\nThat is from the preface to\
  \ Ortho-epia Gallica by John Eliot (1593). According to Charles Nicholl,\_\u201C\
  the Ortho-epia Gallica is a curious and colourful work\_: ostensibly a language-manual,\
  \ of the type very popular in cosmopolitan London, it turns out on closer inspection\
  \ to be a lampoon of other language-manuals and of the foreigners who wrote them\u201D\
  .\nMy source is Charles Nicholl's A Cup Of News\_: The Life Of Thomas Nashe (1984),\
  \ wherein I also gleaned those other recent bits of Nashery.\n[2012-02-13]"
