text: "This morning, at nine o\u2019 clock, I celebrated Adam's birthday, for as we\
  \ know\nIn the seventeenth century, in his great work, Dr. John Lightfoot, Vice-Chancellor\
  \ of the University of Cambridge, and one of the most eminent Hebrew scholars of\
  \ his time, declared, as the result of his most profound and exhaustive study of\
  \ the Scriptures, that \u201Cheaven and earth, centre and circumference, were created\
  \ all together, in the same instant, and clouds full of water,\u201D and that \u201C\
  this work took place and man was created by the Trinity on October 23, 4004 B.C.,\
  \ at nine of the clock in the morning\nor so said Andrew Dickson White in A History\
  \ of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). It has been suggested\
  \ that White was rather selectively quoting Lightfoot, and there are arguments to\
  \ be had. But let us not get into a kerfuffle about it. Clearly the important thing\
  \ is that God knew what time it was, on what day, in what month, of what year. Being\
  \ majestic and subtle and ineffable, He did not proclaim the beginning of all things\
  \ as \u201CYear Zero\u201D, as the tiresomely literal-minded Pol Pot did, in spite\
  \ of a French university education. I think we can all be grateful that the universe,\
  \ with all its kinks and crooked timbers, was created by a mischievous beardy rascal\
  \ and not by that Cambodian psychopath.\n[2011-10-23]"
