  In my Dabbler cupboard this week I make a convincing argument that the names of
  the stations on the Docklands Light Railway are as worthy of having their own dedicated
  forecast on the radio as those oh so evocative shipping areas.

  And while we are on the subject of BBC Radio 4, I should note that I learned something
  very fascinating on Farming Today this morning. Apparently, on no account whatsoever
  should you ever tell anybody how many sheep you have, even if they have the gall
  to come out and ask you directly. Remember that.
