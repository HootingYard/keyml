text: "Pebblehead's Book Of British Pebbles is something of a departure for the bestselling\
  \ paperback potboilerist. Best known for his fat airport-bookstall blockbusters\
  \ with one-word titles ending in an exclamation mark, his latest tome is a picture\
  \ book featuring hundreds of snaps of pebbles accompanied by sprightly and vivid\
  \ explanatory texts.\n\u201CFor many years I have been collecting pebbles,\u201D\
  \ said Pebblehead, sheltering from the rain under an umbrella outside a sordid backstreet\
  \ bordello where he was buttonholed by an eager young cub reporter from a regional\
  \ newspaper, \u201CAnd it occurred to me to exploit my success as a writer of potboilers\
  \ to bring the joy of pebbles to a wider audience. Pebbles are too often ignored\
  \ and neglected in this day and age. I want people to notice them, admire them,\
  \ pick them up and plop them in their pockets and take them home, then place them\
  \ on their mantelpiece or windowsill and give them a good polish with a rag and\
  \ a spraycan of Mr Brightly Dazzling propietary pebble polish from time to time.\
  \ They are also very useful for chucking at swans if you have a fit of pique when\
  \ taking a turn around your local duckpond.\u201D\nAnd with that, the indefatigable\
  \ paperbackist clamped his pipe tighter between his jaws and flounced off in the\
  \ rain towards some fresh hell.\n[2013-09-22]"
