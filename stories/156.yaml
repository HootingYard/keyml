  \ item on the Silos Of Concern. When he had finished reproaching me for reading\
  \ the Guardian \u2013 claiming it makes me \u201Chuffy\u201D\u2014he very helpfully\
  \ wrote to tell me that it is possible to fry an egg in a silage pit. Naturally,\
  \ I asked for further details, to which he replied as follows:\nChoose your silage\
  \ pit.\nDig down about 2 feet. (Deeper the hole quicker the frying time)\nCrack\
  \ egg into hole.\nWait and observe the egg, turning if necessary, till it is cooked\
  \ to your taste.\nRetrieve the fried egg and marvel.\nON NO ACCOUNT ATTEMPT TO EAT\
  \ THE EGG.\nIt will probably be poisonous or, at least, shot through with rotting\
  \ grass.\nI read this with some consternation. Important questions were screaming\
  \ in my head. What criteria should I use to make my choice of silage pit? Could\
  \ I dig using any old spade or did he recommend a particular kind? Would I need\
  \ a metal or plastic or wooden spatula to turn and retrieve my egg, or would any\
  \ kind do? What did he suggest I do with the uneaten egg once I had stopped marvelling?\
  \ Could it be fed safely to any barnyard animals? If so, which ones?\nI am pleased\
  \ to say that OutaSpaceman wrote back with commendable promptness. This is what\
  \ he had to say:\n1. Age is the primary criteria. The longer the pit has been filled\
  \ and festering the better.\n2. A peat cutter is probably the best implement to\
  \ use as this will give the hole good clean corners and prevent side collapse. (On\
  \ no account should a shovel be used because of the contamination risk i.e. I've\
  \ never shovelled excrement with a spade)\n3. My own preference is for a stainless\
  \ steel spatula with a wooden handle. Hygiene being the prime advantage of this\
  \ utensil and the opportunity for reuse after a comprehensive sterilisation. Wooden\
  \ spatulas carry the risk of contamination from prior use and the very real threat\
  \ of combustion. Plastic spatulas will melt.\n4. The uneaten egg should be placed\
  \ on a clay pigeon trap and shot at by an untutored, unsupervised ten year old child.\
  \ Feeding animal protein to, in the majority, vegetarian creatures is an unnatural\
  \ practice. That's how we got BSE.\nIf any other readers have any silage pit-related\
  \ recipes, please send them in. We could have the makings of a Christmas bestseller.\n\
