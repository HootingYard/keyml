text: "Hooting Yard's anagrammatist-in-residence, R., has alerted me to a non-anagrammatical\
  \ matter of some importance. Winchester woman finds 3ft wasp nest on bed, says a\
  \ report on the BBC news page. As R. remarks, it is \u201Cdisappointing that it's\
  \ the extent of the nest, rather than the magnitude of a particular wasp, to which\
  \ this headline refers\u201D. I have read and reread the story, in the faint hope\
  \ that R. misunderstood it and that there really is\u2014or was\u2014a 3ft wasp\
  \ at large in Hampshire. It would make a terrific short story, wouldn't it? As Mrs\
  \ Gubbins awoke one morning from uneasy dreams she found herself transformed in\
  \ her bed into a gigantic wasp. Or has somebody already written something similar?\n\
  Elsewhere at the BBC, I heard\u2014in the woozy world between sleep and wakefulness\u2014\
  something about squirrels with leprosy. This was a report on Farming Today on Radio\
  \ 4, a show I have come to think of as Girly Farming Club. The BBC seems forever\
  \ to be wringing its hands at the under-representation of women, but Farming Today\
  \ is produced and presented by an exclusively female team. Regrettably, however,\
  \ not one of them sounds remotely like a proper peasant.\n[2014-08-28]"
