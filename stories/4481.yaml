text: "The Man Who Ate His Own Head is the new paperback potboiler by Pebblehead,\
  \ the latest in his series of novellas featuring \u201CBeing Of The Future\u201D\
  \ David Blunkett. The fictional superperson ought not, of course, be confused with\
  \ the Labour politician of the same name, though some people do get them mixed up.\
  \ Much the same collision of political fact and speculative fiction occurs in Norman\
  \ Spinrad's \u201Cagonizing science fiction adventure novel\u201D of 1967, Agent\
  \ Of Chaos, in which, to quote the back cover blurb, \u201CThe scene [is] Dome One,\
  \ Mars. The terrible dictatorship ruling the planet was the Brotherhood of Assassins,\
  \ and Boris Johnson, head of the Democratic League was plotting to overthrow the\
  \ Hegemony and to restore democratic rule. The Hegemony, that mysterious group that\
  \ controls the entire solar system, was now threatening to control the entire human\
  \ race and render Man extinct! The entire galaxy in chaos; now bloodshed, then infinity\u2026\
  ?\u201D (You can read more about fictive Boris Johnson here.)\n\nIn The Man Who\
  \ Ate His Own Head, the Being Of The Future sits down at some sort of futuristic\
  \ dinner table, picks up his futuristic knife and futuristic fork, and tucks in\
  \ to a futuristic meal piled on his futuristic plate. It is unclear what is so futuristic\
  \ about the meal, as it consists of peas and gravy and jugged hare and cauliflower\
  \ and cream crackers. Be that as it may, a robot valet appears at Blunkett's side\
  \ and, through some form of futuristic mind control, persuades him to eat his own\
  \ head. This he accomplishes, though not without difficulty, and Pebblehead is very\
  \ sketchy about the precise sequence of events.\nI will not give away the ending.\
  \ Suffice it to say that the paperbackist unleashes some of his finest narrative\
  \ pyrotechnics, and we are introduced, at the last, to the Being Of The Future's\
  \ futuristic guide dog, Skippy, with the clear indication that this thousand-eyed\
  \ zinc, tin, titanium, bakelite, and leather hound, stuffed with excelsior, will\
  \ feature in the sequel, due out next week. Even as I write, Pebblehead is tapping\
  \ away in his chalet o\u2019 prose, brow furrowed, pipe clenched in his infected\
  \ teeth.\n[2010-05-20]"
