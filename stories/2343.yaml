  \ such distractions as the monkey feng shui consultant and the sandpaper palaver.\
  \ But a few things twitched the Hooting Yard antennae, among them:\nThe imminence\
  \ of a global pig flu epidemic\nThe fact that it was once common, in fashionable\
  \ society, to call a humble or paid companion a \u201Ctoad-eater\u201D\nThe splendid\
  \ news that Resonance magnifico Ed Baxter appeared in the Independent On Sunday\
  \ list of 100 people who make Britain happy\nBela Tarr's film The Man From London,\
  \ characteristically slow and grim and bleak and black and white, contains a scene\
  \ with a pair of tailors reminiscent of The Fast Show\nThere is a Hooting Yard Appreciation\
  \ Society on Facebook, with 28 members and little or no activity\nIf I can rouse\
  \ myself from indolence, I will insert links so readers can scoot off elsewhere\
  \ on the web to investigate these matters. If not, you shall have to do your own\
  \ research, which will no doubt be good for your moral fibre, if not mine.\n[2009-04-24]"
