text: "It is a little over three years since we learned that Crouch is big threat\
  \ says Kaka. Now things have taken a further turn. According to today's inky bulletin,\
  \ Kak\xE1 might claim he is in shape but Dunga is bound to be uneasy. There are\
  \ two things of immediate note. First, Kak\xE1 has gained an accent over his final\
  \ A, although we are not told what he has done to deserve this. Secondly, the threat\
  \ of Crouch has not merely receded but vanished entirely, supplanted by the uneasiness\
  \ of Dunga. Dunga does not have an accent on his A, which may account in part for\
  \ his nerviness, born as it may be from envy of Kak\xE1's newly acquired accent.\
  \ The obliterated Crouch, without an A to his name, was never going to be accorded\
  \ an accent, and in any case at the time he was considered a threat by Kak\xE1,\
  \ Kak\xE1 himself was accentless. It may well be that the threat of Crouch and the\
  \ unease of Dunga have nothing whatsoever to do with accents over As. Further work\
  \ must be done before drawing a watertight conclusion.\nSo what are we to make of\
  \ Kak\xE1's claim to be \u201Cin shape\u201D? It is surely pertinent that the shape\
  \ itself goes unmentioned. Triangle? Oblong? Dodecahedron? Or perhaps even mere\
  \ blob? This could be the true source of Dunga's unease. Dunga may also be wondering\
  \ what happened to Crouch, of course. Three years ago, Crouch was a big threat\u2014\
  or was at least perceived as such by Kaka, as he was then\u2014and now, pfft!, he\
  \ is nowhere to be seen, Kak\xE1 meanwhile having clambered into, or been ingested\
  \ by, an undefined \u201Cshape\u201D. This would make any of us uneasy, so we ought\
  \ not tsk tsk at Dunga for a wholly natural reaction. And we should mark well that\
  \ not only is Dunga uneasy, he is bound to be uneasy. He has no choice in the matter.\
  \ His uneasiness has been thrust upon him, whatever his feelings in the matter,\
  \ by this claim of Kak\xE1's, a claim made, we take it, from within a shape, a shape\
  \ of which we know little, if anything. You or I would, I'll warrant, be uneasy.\
  \ How much more so, then, Dunga, even without the vanished threat of Crouch?\nThese\
  \ are deep matters, to be sure, and there will no doubt be further developments\
  \ in the coming weeks. We must do our best to keep abreast of them, and treat them\
  \ with the gravity they deserve.\n[2010-06-08]"
