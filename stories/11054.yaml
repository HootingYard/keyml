text: "One Wednesday afternoon in Split, Ferdy Pog\xF3stic\_was bouncing along the\
  \ boulevard on his pogo-stick when he heard a voice in his head.\n\u201CFerdinand!\
  \ You are the living embodiment of the great Gak! Go forth and do the doings of\
  \ the Gak!\u201D\nBut Ferdy heeded not the voice, and continued to bounce along.\
  \ So the voice returned, more insistent, deafening, until Ferdy paid attention to\
  \ it. He stopped bouncing, and chucked his pogo-stick into a canal, and went forth\
  \ as instructed.\nHis first stopping point was a Split butcher's shop. He marched\
  \ in under the awning and announced to the startled butcher that he, Ferdy, was\
  \ the great Gak, and that he must have a blood sausage.\n\u201CFor the great Gak\
  \ has a blood sausage in all the paintings and icons,\u201D he added, as if in explanation.\n\
  The startled butcher had no idea what this bedraggled fool was talking about, and\
  \ sent him packing with a flea in his ear.\nAnd so Ferdy Pog\xF3stic\_went a-wandering\
  \ through the streets of Split, without his pogo-stick and without a blood sausage,\
  \ and nobody recognised him as the living embodiment of the great Gak.\nAnd eventually,\
  \ on the outskirts of Split, he sat him down anent a well. And then came the voice\
  \ once more within his head.\n\u201COops. I mistook you for a different bedgraggled\
  \ fool. You are not after all the living embodiment of the great Gak. My apologies.\u201D\
  \nAnd Ferdy Pog\xF3stic\_sat by the well and wept.\nAnd there came a terrific thunderstorm\
  \ and teeming rainfall, so much rain that the well filled up with water, until it\
  \ overflowed. And there, bobbing to the surface, was a well-duck, with bright feathers\
  \ and gleaming beak. It quacked at Ferdy in a language he did not comprehend. He\
  \ chucked a pebble at it.\nBy now it was Wednesday evening and time for Ferdy to\
  \ go home. In spite of the unfriendly pebble, the duck splashed out of the well\
  \ and followed him, waddling in his wake. And when he was home and was sitting in\
  \ his armchair by the fire in his chalet in an insalubrious neighbourhood in Split,\
  \ the well-duck came and sat upon his head, and would not budge.\n\u201CTomorrow,\u201D\
  \ said Ferdy to himself, \u201CI must retrieve my pogo-stick from the canal. Perhaps\
  \ when I am once again bouncing along the boulevard I will be able to dislodge this\
  \ damnable duck.\u201D\nBut could he?\nAcross town, the startled butcher was in\
  \ the back room of his shop, behind a bead curtain, stuffing sausage skins with\
  \ the blood of ducks. On the wall hung an icon of the great Gak. Or was it the butcher's\
  \ mirror?\n[2013-02-22]"
