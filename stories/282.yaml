text: "Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting Facts About Birds was one of the fattest\
  \ pamphlets Dobson ever published. The title is something of a misnomer, for the\
  \ remarkable thing about this work is that it contains not a single fact about birds\
  \ whatsoever. Indeed, apart from the occasional passing mention of starlings (page\
  \ 49), shrikelets (page 92) and a swan (page 119), birds are signally absent from\
  \ the text. In spite of this, the pamphlet has been hailed by the upstart young\
  \ Dobsonist Ted Cack as \u201Cthe most informative text on ornithology that I have\
  \ ever read\u201D. Cack is not always the most intellectually agile of critics,\
  \ though, so perhaps we should not take him too seriously, the way we might furrow\
  \ our brows in deep concentration at even the merest squib from a theoretical colossus\
  \ like, say, Terry Eagleton.\nDobson wrote the pamphlet at a time when he was preoccupied\
  \ with moles. He was fascinated by their burrowing habits, near-blindness, and twitching\
  \ snouts. Although the snouts of moles twitch less than those of shrews, particularly\
  \ elephant shrews, Dobson was enamoured of what he considered the more \u201Cmoley\u201D\
  \ twitching of the snouts of moles. Why, then, did he not essay a pamphlet of unusual\
  \ and arresting facts about moles, rather than birds, when it was moles that intrigued\
  \ him during this period? It should be noted that his tract makes no mention of\
  \ [insert Latin tag for moles here] either.\nA clue may be found in the fact that\
  \ at the time of the pamphlet's writing, Dobson was engaged in a feud with a bellicose\
  \ undertaker from down Pointy Town way. No one can be quite sure any more what caused\
  \ the vendetta, not even Ted Cack, who admits to utter beflummoxment about the whole\
  \ matter. But there was an exchange of letters, among much else, and in one of these\
  \ the out of print pamphleteer wrote as follows:\n\u201CNot only are you a singularly\
  \ bellicose undertaker, sir, but you keep the seats in your death carriage in a\
  \ very greasy condition. My dry cleaners had the devil of a job returning my trousers\
  \ to their usual impeccability after last I sat upon those seats when attending\
  \ the funeral rites of Thruxtonshaw Beppo, the noted mole- and bird-expert whose\
  \ friendship I had come to treasure. It is true that I have not sought from you\
  \ financial recompense for the cost of degreasing my trousers, but that is only\
  \ because I have a more terrible revenge in mind.\u201D\nThe authenticity of this\
  \ letter has been questioned, chiefly because the last thing one tends to associate\
  \ with Dobson is a pair of impeccable trousers. I am not suggesting that he was\
  \ forever covered in grease, far from it, but a certain shabbiness, even grubbiness,\
  \ was part of his general aura, even the aura detected by our psychic brethren and\
  \ sistren, as attested by the redoubtable Madame Boubou, who sometimes did \u201C\
  readings\u201D of the pamphleteer's ethereal being. Dobson himself was unaware of\
  \ these, as the turbanned Madame was given to following him about, skulking down\
  \ alleyways or creeping after him as he reconnoitred picnicking spots in fields\
  \ and parkland. She would target him, from behind, with her fearsome gaze, and make\
  \ visible his aura for long enough to allow her to scribble a few notes into her\
  \ psychic notepad. Often such notes contained the words \u201Cgrubby\u201D, \u201C\
  grimy\u201D, \u201Cdishevelled\u201D, and \u201Csplattered with muck\u201D\u2026\
  \ and remember, that was his spiritual aura, not his solid, earthbound person.\n\
  Anyway, whether it is genuine or not, it is the reference in the letter to Thruxtonshaw\
  \ Beppo that concerns us here. Dobson\u2014or the counterfeiter pretending to be\
  \ Dobson\u2014correctly identifies the deceased Beppo as a mole- and bird-expert,\
  \ as indeed he was, and one who the pamphleteer met often in the final days of his,\
  \ the mole- and bird-expert's, life. They first encountered each other at a football\
  \ match (Red Star Hoon versus Pang Hill Academicals), where Dobson had gone to make\
  \ a tape recording of turnstile-clacking noises and Beppo was present as a turnstile-clacking\
  \ counter. It may seem to be unusual employment for a mole- and bird-expert, but\
  \ Beppo was the kind of impoverished amateur who was perpetually short of cash,\
  \ and on this particular day he was actually very close to starvation. It is thought\
  \ that Dobson took pity on the skeletal clack-counter and tossed him a pastry from\
  \ his bag, much as one might feed a zoo animal. The two men rapidly hit it off,\
  \ and indeed there was something juvenile in their camaraderie. They addressed each\
  \ other by foolish code-names, \u201CBroadsword\u201D and \u201CDanny Boy\u201D\
  , using these soubriquets as an excuse to practice their impersonations of Richard\
  \ Burton and Michael Hordern in the film Where Eagles Dare. Incidentally, the film's\
  \ screenplay, and the novel on which it is based, were written by the alcoholic\
  \ Scottish writer Alistair MacLean, who is buried just yards away from Richard Burton\
  \ in a Swiss graveyard. Several of MacLean's novels include the phrase \u201Cthe\
  \ huddled shapelessness of the dead\u201D, suggesting that this was an id\xE9e fixe\
  \ lodged in the writer's gin-soaked cranium, perhaps an unvanquishable memory from\
  \ his war service in the Royal Navy, where he was involved in action in the Atlantic\
  \ theatre, on two Arctic convoys and escorting carrier groups in operations against\
  \ Tirpitz and other targets off the Norwegian coast; in 1944 in the Mediterranean\
  \ theatre, as part of the invasion of southern France and in helping to sink blockade\
  \ runners off Crete and bombard Milos in the Aegean Sea; and in 1945, in the Far\
  \ East theatre, escorting carrier groups in operations against Japanese targets\
  \ in Burma, Malaya, and Sumatra. MacLean's late-in-life claims that he was captured\
  \ by the Japanese and tortured have been dismissed by both his son and his biographer\
  \ as drunken ravings. The Huddled Shapelessness Of The Dead is also the title of\
  \ an exceedingly rare and out of print Dobson pamphlet, a piece of fluff about dead\
  \ bees.\nDobson and Beppo began to meet daily, commandeering a corner table in The\
  \ Cow And Pins tavern, where they talked for hours about both birds and moles. The\
  \ expert knew his days were numbered, as he had already been diagnosed with the\
  \ invariably fatal Withered Innards Syndrome, and it may be that he wanted to pass\
  \ on his knowledge before he died. Intriguingly, in his eight decades, Beppo had\
  \ not once put pen to paper, and his matchless store of information about birds\
  \ and moles he carried entirely in his head. And what a head it was! The versifier\
  \ Dennis Beerpint once described it, in conversation rather than in a poem, as \u201C\
  Beppo's head, that great block of human head, dense and solid and mottled like a\
  \ potato\u201D. He made this remark during one of his rare television appearances,\
  \ on the Shadrach & Abednego chatshow, on which he was a guest in the week after\
  \ Beppo's death. There were others lined up to extol the bird- and mole-expert,\
  \ including songstress Kathy Kirby and bowler-hatted Avengers star Patrick McNee,\
  \ but Beerpint would not stop babbling, and in those days of live broadcasts and\
  \ a more spontaneous approach, he was allowed to continue until the next programme\u2014\
  a three-hour silent black-and-white documentary about swans\u2014was due to begin.\
  \ It was, of course, on a different edition of the same chatshow that Beerpint became\
  \ the first person to utter the word \u201CUbuntu\u201D on television.\nIf either\
  \ moles or birds were mentioned in Dobson's pamphlet Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting\
  \ Facts About Birds, we could draw the sensible conclusion that the pamphleteer\
  \ had simply mixed up the fantastic amount of information pouring out of Beppo over\
  \ that tavern table. But as we have seen, moles are not mentioned in the text at\
  \ all, and birds only in passing. Wherein, then, lies the enigma of the seemingly\
  \ gratuitous title? One possibility is that Dobson was using a code, akin to the\
  \ childish \u201CBroadsword\u201D and \u201CDanny Boy\u201D with which the pair\
  \ of ageing rascals addressed each other. If so, I do not think it is a code anyone\
  \ is going to crack. Dobson left a teeming pile of notebooks and scribblings, catalogued\
  \ by Aloysius Nestingbird and others with heroic diligence, and it seems to me that\
  \ somewhere in that paper Kilimanjaro they would have found a scrap upon which the\
  \ pamphleteer worked out his cipher, if cipher it was. The bumptious noodlehead\
  \ and pretend Dobson scholar Emeric Vinvanvoo made a fool of himself with his claim\
  \ that the pamphlet's title was an anagram of Ubuntu And Dust Can Be No Fruits Of\
  \ A Horrid SAS Salt Gas, chiefly because it isn't. That did not stop him weaving\
  \ a ludicrous fantasy that Dobson and Beppo were engaged in some kind of top secret\
  \ paramilitary gas experimentation programme. Wittily, one commentator dismissed\
  \ Vinvanvoo's ravings as \u201Clike something out of an Alistair MacLean novel\u201D\
  , demonstrating a contextual grasp of the whole Dobson/Beppo affair which I quite\
  \ envy.\nI am doing my best, you see, but though I have studied the pamphlet for\
  \ years now I can still make head nor tail of what Dobson was driving at. Usually,\
  \ you know where you stand with his titles. How I Poked A Pointed Stick Into A Hedge\
  \ is a pamphlet in which Dobson writes about poking a pointed stick into a hedge.\
  \ Christ Stopped At Eboli is about Christ stopping at Eboli. Granted, in both these\
  \ works, as with almost all his pamphlets, Dobson veers off into often surprising\
  \ digressions, but generally speaking he takes his subject, his fad or whim of the\
  \ moment, and wrings out of it all that can be wrung, and more. Even the youthful,\
  \ callow Ted Cack has had the insight that \u201Cwhatever the topic of his pamphlet,\
  \ Dobson's ambition was to have the last word, to make any further approach to the\
  \ subject futile, for at least a century, and preferably longer. Whether writing\
  \ about carpet beetles or electrical wiring systems or a dub version of the soundtrack\
  \ to Carl Sagan's television series Cosmos, Dobson worried away at his theme like\
  \ a small predatory beast gnawing upon the limp body of a smaller, non-predatory\
  \ beast from which the life was rapidly draining, as it were a tawny owl with a\
  \ hamster, or a shrew with a newborn goat, for example.\u201D\nSo if we take Ted\
  \ Cack's metaphor and think of Dobson as a tawny owl or a shrew, what kind of hamster\
  \ or newborn goat is he tearing to pieces in Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting\
  \ Facts About Birds? Is that a question to which we can ever give a sensible answer?\
  \ Well, I think we can. Not today, maybe, and perhaps not tomorrow, nor even this\
  \ week. Nor next week, nor next month, nay even unto Saint Loopy's Day. But I will\
  \ promise this much. By the time you are all celebrating the next Saint Loopy's\
  \ Day, I will publish the mighty tome on which I have laboured like an idiot for\
  \ the last God knows how many years. I long ago lost count of the number of tallow\
  \ candles I have burned to light my futuristic flame-resistant reinforced plastic\
  \ writer's cabin where I crouch, scrivening away, through days and nights, year\
  \ after year, sustained only by a peculiar soup-based nutrient slop and by a blinding\
  \ conviction that my privations are worthwhile because I shall, finally, pierce\
  \ the shroud of ignorance enveloping Dobson's fattest pamphlet. And when, on that\
  \ merry day, The Annotated Pop-Up Edition Of \u2018Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting\
  \ Facts About Birds\u2019 By Dobson, With A Preface, Introduction, Notes, Commentary,\
  \ Afterword, Exegesis, Maps, Colour Plates, Exquisite Binding, Greaseproof Wrapper\
  \ And Presentation Crate, Guaranteed Free Of Infestation By Microscopic Paper-Devouring\
  \ Beings hits the shelves of your local supermarket, I shall smash my way out of\
  \ my cabin and scamper through the meadows, flailing my arms and beaming with glee.\n\
