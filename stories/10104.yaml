text: "A letter arrives:\nDear, beloved Mr Key\nWe are lost, hopelessly hopelessly\
  \ hopelessly lost. We write \u201Chopelessly\u201D thrice to indicate that each\
  \ of us is hopeless. We would not have you think one is hopeless while two retain\
  \ hope, nor that two are hopeless and one still hopeful. We are all hopeless and\
  \ we are all lost.\nHow we have come to this pass may take some explaining. We got\
  \ off the bus, as you told us. We were on a lane. There was a hedge. There may have\
  \ been birds nesting in the hedge. There was certainly sign of nest, if not of bird.\
  \ Had a bird returned to the nest while we stood there in the lane as the bus chugged\
  \ away into the distance, there is every chance we might have killed the bird for\
  \ food. We were famished. Lucky bird, then, that it was off and out, somewhere in\
  \ the sky, in flight.\nWe peered over the hedge. There was a field. It was an extensive\
  \ field containing several cows. We pondered killing one of the cows for food but\
  \ could not come up with a method. Had there been a bird in the nest in the hedge,\
  \ we could have borne down upon it, the three of us, menacingly, and made short\
  \ work of it. Two could hold it still while the third throttled it. We looked at\
  \ a cow and tried to picture applying that same method. It was not a convincing\
  \ picture.\nWe cast our six eyes around in case there might be a pile of rocks in\
  \ the field or beside the lane. With a rock of sufficient size we thought one of\
  \ us might bash the cow about the head until it dropped dead. But look as we might\
  \ there seemed to be nothing bigger than a stone or a pebble, neither of which we\
  \ thought would prove fatal to a cow no matter how hard we hit it. We had to bear\
  \ in mind the presence of several cows and assume that the ones we did not attack\
  \ would come rushing to the aid of the one we did. A few quick sharp blows with\
  \ a big rock would kill a cow before the other cows came a-charging. But we would\
  \ have no such window of opportunity armed with mere pebbles. We dismissed the cows\
  \ as a possible source of food and turned our attentions back to the lane.\nWe were\
  \ famished, but at this stage we were not yet hopeless, nor indeed lost. After all,\
  \ we had only just alighted from the bus and had not yet had time to get our bearings.\
  \ In our hearts there was a flicker of optimism that within a few hundred yards\
  \ we might come upon the orchard with its squirrels, or the hotel, or both. We decided\
  \ to walk along the lane in the same direction in which the bus had travelled. The\
  \ bus itself had disappeared over the horizon. Ahead of us we could see various\
  \ clumps and slopes and distant buildings. Hence our hope.\nShortly afterwards,\
  \ we came upon a puddle of recent rainwater. We fell upon our knees and drank our\
  \ fill. It was a big puddle, so we did not drain it. We spotted in it a small pale,\
  \ almost translucent, writhing wriggling wormy maggoty kind of being. Food! We could\
  \ have compared notes on whose famishment was most debilitating, or drawn lots,\
  \ but instead, and in spite of its tininess, having plucked it from the puddle we\
  \ chopped it into three equal portions. Squatting beside the puddle, we then sucked\
  \ on our helping rather than bolting it down, to eke from it all the nourishment\
  \ we could and to make it last as long as possible. Yum!\nThus fortified, if only\
  \ minimally, we toiled on along the lane. Certain clumps and slopes and distant\
  \ buildings grew closer. None was yet close enough to ascertain whether an orchard\
  \ or hotel was among them. Pangs of thirst now beset us, as the wormy maggoty thing\
  \ had proved surprisingly salty. We encountered no further puddles, but then the\
  \ hedge beside the lane came to a sudden stop and in its place was a ditch. In the\
  \ ditch was a great deal of water, an admixture of recent rain and some kind of\
  \ filthy muck-riddled brownish liquid oozing up from below. We judged that were\
  \ we to drink it, we would be at risk of stomach cramps and digestive horrors and\
  \ many another gastric malady. \u201CGastric\u201D may not be the appropriate word,\
  \ but let it stand. So we trudged on, the watery ditch alongside us like a cruel\
  \ taunt of the devil's. It may have been about this time we began to lose hope.\
  \ But we were still not lost, because we could see the clumps and slopes and distant\
  \ buildings ahead. We had something to aim towards, be it but a chimera.\nBut then\
  \ a mist descended. It was a thick mist. We could not even see our hands in front\
  \ of our faces, let alone the clumps and slopes and distant buildings. There was\
  \ some relief in the fact that moisture was present in the mist, so if we gulped\
  \ mouthfuls of it and swallowed, our thirst raged a little less, oh a little less,\
  \ but enough, enough. If you can put yourself in the place of a famished and thirst-ravaged\
  \ orphan recently discharged from an orphanage and sent into the rustic wastelands\
  \ on a fact checking mission by a writer of unparalleled genius, accompanied by\
  \ two similarly discharged and famished and thirst-ravaged orphans from the same\
  \ orphanage on the same fact checking mission, you will appreciate how greedily\
  \ we gulped that mist-moisture.\nIn fact, we were so revitalised that we said \u201C\
  Pshaw!\u201D to the mist, the three of us in unison, and we blundered onwards, even\
  \ though we could not see where we were going. This was our undoing. For when the\
  \ mist cleared, as suddenly as it had descended, there was no sign of the clumps\
  \ and the slopes and the distant buildings. There was merely a bleak expanse of\
  \ nothingness. We were lost. And we were hopelessly hopelessly hopelessly lost.\n\
  We slumped against a blob of the nothingness that might have been a vestige of hedge\
  \ or of the side of a ditch. We sobbed quietly for a while. Then we wrote this report.\
  \ It is an interim report. Hopeless we may be, thrice hopeless, but we shall press\
  \ on with our mission, as if it were a metaphor for man's life upon this mortal\
  \ coil. If you receive this letter, you will know that at least we stumbled upon\
  \ a postbox. What the postbox is a metaphor for, we leave for you to judge.\nYours\
  \ lost and hopeless, your devoted fact checking team.\nBim, Bam and Little Nitty\n\
