text: "\u201CI am not just a person who goes around peeing on tombs, but a writer\
  \ with a serious oeuvre.\u201D\nSo says one Eduardo Labarca, quoted in today's Grauniad.\
  \ Proclaiming oneself to be the creator of \u201Ca serious oeuvre\u201D is akin\
  \ to the claim, invariably made by humourless persons, that \u201CI've got a mad\
  \ sense of humour, me\u201D. Labarca also states \u201CPeeing on that tomb was a\
  \ legitimate artistic act.\u201D Ah! How delightfully transgressive!\nIt briefly\
  \ occurred to me to court notoriety and publicity by desecrating the grave of, say,\
  \ Anthony Burgess, but then I realised that I am no longer a teenperson. Nor, for\
  \ that matter, is the absurd Labarca.\n[2011-01-25]"
