text: "I was reading the other day about closed-down shipyards and came upon a reference\
  \ to Swan Hunter. This served to remind me of a fellow I met recently whose business\
  \ card\u2014which he handed to me\u2014announced his business as a swan hunter.\
  \ We were guests at a swish sophisticated cocktail party and he was leaning insouciantly\
  \ against a mantelpiece. He apologised that the card was smeared with blood, explaining\
  \ that it was the blood of a swan and that such smearage was an occupational hazard.\n\
  \u201CSurely,\u201D I said, \u201CThere is not much hunting to do to find swans?\
  \ Do you not just head for the nearest body of water, such as a pond or a canal,\
  \ which swans are known to frequent?\u201D\n\u201CThere is a measure of truth in\
  \ what you say,\u201D he replied, bringing up an unseemly gobbet of catarrh and\
  \ spitting it into a napkin, \u201CBut first one must find the pond or canal. Though\
  \ swans are almost invariably found on ponds and canals, it does not follow that\
  \ all ponds and canals have their resident swans, as a moment's thought will confirm.\u201D\
  \n\u201CFair enough,\u201D I said, \u201CBut identifying those ponds and canals\
  \ where you might find a swan hardly counts as hunting. You just need to obtain\
  \ a map and mark with a pencilled X those ponds and canals shown on it which are\
  \ known to be populated by swans. You can do that while sitting in an armchair.\u201D\
  \nHe spat into his napkin again.\n\u201CI could indeed,\u201D he said, \u201CBut\
  \ that would take all the thrill out of the hunt. I prefer to go a-roaming through\
  \ the countryside, or through a large municipal park, sniffing the air and studying\
  \ the terrain until I track down a pond or a canal. And even then,\u201D he continued\
  \ before I had a chance to interrupt, \u201CThere can be no guarantee that the pond\
  \ or canal I come upon will be swanful. The uncertainty adds to the excitement.\u201D\
  \n\u201CIt might be more accurate to say, then, that you are a pond and canal hunter,\
  \ rather than a swan hunter,\u201D I said.\n\u201CBosh!\u201D he shouted, slopping\
  \ some of his cocktail onto the hearth-rug, \u201CWhere no swans are in evidence\
  \ upon the pond or canal I have stalked, I press on, indefatigably, come rain or\
  \ shine.\u201D\n\u201CSo let us assume,\u201D I said, \u201CThat you have arrived\
  \ at a pond or canal teeming with swans, whether in the countryside or in parkland.\
  \ Do you then take potshots at them with a Mannlicher-Carcano sniper's rifle?\u201D\
  \n\u201CHeaven forfend!\u201D he cried, slopping more cocktail onto the rug, \u201C\
  Where would be the sport in that? No, I go unarmed. Swan hunting, when executed\
  \ properly, is the pitting of man against swan in a primal struggle. Having selected\
  \ an individual swan, I engage it in combat. That is why I have had my arms broken\
  \ several times in several places.\u201D\n\u201CAh,\u201D I said, \u201CI was wondering\
  \ why you held your cocktail glass at a rather curious angle.\u201D\nActually, I\
  \ ws not wondering this at all. I was just making conversation. It has never been\
  \ my habit to examine in any detail the angles at which swish sophisticated cocktail\
  \ party guests hold their cocktail glasses, nor, for that matter, am I much exercised\
  \ when in their excitement they slop some of the contents of said glasses on to\
  \ the hearth rug, unless of course it is my own hearth rug. But it never is, for\
  \ I do not host my own cocktail parties. I am temperamentally incapable of organising\
  \ sufficient sausages on sticks due to my cackhandedness, which invariably means\
  \ I prick my fingers and thumbs repeatedly with the sharp wooden cocktail sticks,\
  \ drawing blood. No one in their right minds wants to attend a party, however sumptuous\
  \ the cocktails, if the plates are littered with sausages lying unpunctured beside\
  \ piles of bloodied wooden sticks. A business card smeared with the blood of a swan\
  \ seemed to me a far less gruesome sight. In fact, the more I thought about it,\
  \ my own reservations about hosting a cocktail party seemed immeasurably more interesting\
  \ than listening to a man wittering on about his experiences of unarmed combat with\
  \ swans, fighting to the death. Only my impeccable manners prevented me from saying\
  \ so, in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone else in the room.\nIt was only\
  \ then, looking around, that I noticed the swan hunter and I were the only guests\
  \ still present. Everyone else had tiptoed out, through the open French windows.\
  \ Peering out into the dusk, I saw approaching, marching relentlessly across the\
  \ lawn, a gaggle of savage and vengeful swans.\n[2015-06-01]"
