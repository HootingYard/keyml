text: "The pounding of those infernal drums began shortly before dawn. I could hear\
  \ them, in the distance, from far across the wild and desolate tarputa. It was not\
  \ a regular, rhythmic pounding, but a drum din more disturbing, a clattering cacophony\
  \ of bangs and rattles and thumps and booms, as if a thousand Chris Cutlers were\
  \ improvising simultaneously. In the folding camp-cot next to mine, Carruthers stirred.\n\
  \u201CMy God!\u201D he said, \u201CWhat is it? Your countenance is ghastly, and\
  \ the blood has drained from your face, which is twitching horribly, like Herbert\
  \ Lom in the Clouseau films.\u201D\n\u201CIt's the pounding of those infernal drums,\
  \ Carruthers,\u201D I replied, \u201CCan you not hear them?\u201D\n\u201CBit of\
  \ a problem with the old hearing, actually,\u201D he said, \u201CSince that savage\
  \ aimed his blowpipe directly at my eardrum the other day.\u201D\nI had forgotten\
  \ the incident. I had forgotten much of what occurred on our journey to the edge\
  \ of the tarputa. Sometimes it is easier to forget.\nI stepped out of the tent,\
  \ lit my pipe, and took a deep draw on the filthy Kirghiz scrag tobacco. The sun\
  \ was rising now, over the tarputa, and the din of the drums grew louder and more\
  \ ominous. Carruthers joined me, lit his own pipe, and muttered something about\
  \ eggs.\nAfter breakfast, sitting in our folding camp-chairs, smoking our pipes,\
  \ we gazed dully across the wild and desolate tarputa. Every so often the bleak\
  \ expanse of nothingness was broken by a swooping bird or a distant, scurrying gazelle.\
  \ The drumming continued without cease, still increasing in volume, though not yet\
  \ within our sight.\n\u201CCan you hear it yet, that infernal pounding?\u201D I\
  \ asked.\n\u201CYes, faintly, in my good ear,\u201D said Carruthers. His face too\
  \ was now twitching horribly.\n\u201CSoon enough whoever is making that godawful\
  \ racket will appear on the horizon,\u201D I said, \u201CWe must devise a plan.\u201D\
  \nCarruthers spread our map out on the folding camp-table. We pondered our position,\
  \ on the edge of the tarputa, with the Big Frightening River behind us. To hide\
  \ in our tent would be unmanly. But our folding camp-rocket launcher was out of\
  \ commission, having been gnawed to ruin by an army of ferocious biting ants.\n\u201C\
  What if we covered ourselves in vividly coloured dyes and posed as savage gods?\u201D\
  \ suggested Carruthers, \u201CWe might strike terror into them, and they would turn\
  \ tail and scamper back to wherever they came from.\u201D\n\u201CBut who are they?\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CWe do not yet know with whom we are dealing.\u201D\n\u201CFair point,\u201D\
  \ said Carruthers, relighting his pipe, which had gone out.\nI set up the folding\
  \ camp-sundial to ascertain the time. It was nearly midday. There was still no sign\
  \ of the infernal drummers, yet the noise they were making was now deafening.\n\u201C\
  More eggs?\u201D said Carruthers. We wolfed down our lunch.\nSuddenly, on the far\
  \ horizon, we could see them. Far from being a thousand, they were just three in\
  \ number. How in the name of all that is holy did they create such a tremendous\
  \ and terrifying din?\nTwo against three. Carruthers and I looked at each other,\
  \ jutted our jaws, and, in unspoken compact, agreed that our chances were better\
  \ than good.\n\u201CLet us wait until we see the whites of their eyes,\u201D I said.\n\
  And so we sat awaiting the drummers as they slowly approached across the wild and\
  \ desolate tarputa. To muffle the din, I stuffed cotton wool into my ears, and Carruthers\
  \ plugged his good ear with a half-sucked boiled sweet. We smoked our pipes.\nAt\
  \ last, shortly before dusk descended upon the tarputa, we saw the whites of six\
  \ eyes. I stood up, and shouted.\n\u201CHalt!\u201D I cried, \u201CStep no further,\
  \ or you will have to answer to the might of the Empire and the fury of the Queen!\
  \ Now cease your infernal drumming and tell me who you are and what is your business!\u201D\
  \nAnd then I learned, and Carruthers learned, that we had found the Urbane Blodgett\
  \ Electronic Percussion Trio, long thought lost, having vanished somewhere in the\
  \ vast and desolate tarputa twenty years before.\n[2013-05-16]"
