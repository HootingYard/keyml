text: "My latest project is to stage a series of tableaux vivants. These will take\
  \ place daily over the coming week. Each one will last for a duration of no more\
  \ than one minute, at a push, at various locations in the hustle and bustle of the\
  \ London streets, what Keith Pratt termed \u201Cthe hurly-burly of the urban conurbation\u201D\
  , and each one will be a vivid, static, solo re-enactment of a significant historical\
  \ event. I have thus far chosen six subjects:\nThe death of Socrates\n  The sinking\
  \ of the Lusitania\n  The Punic Wars\n  The relief of Mafeking\n  The second resignation\
  \ of David Blunkett\n  My first choc-ice\nI would be grateful to readers for suggestions\
  \ for the seventh and final tableau vivant, which it is intended will outshine the\
  \ other six in both vividness and historical significance.\n[2013-07-22]"
