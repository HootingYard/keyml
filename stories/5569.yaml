text: "It is rather quiet at Hooting Yard at the moment. Partly this is because I\
  \ am recovering from the ague which felled me last week, and partly, I think, because\
  \ I am reading a stout collection of short stories by M P Shiel. It is two decades\
  \ since I last immersed myself in the works of that master of purple prose, but\
  \ I am a sensible person, and, as Rebecca West so wisely said, \u201CSensible people\
  \ ought to have a complete set of Shiel\u201D. I do not own such a set, but that\
  \ may be a small mercy. Reading Shiel may not exactly fuddle the brain, but I must\
  \ be very careful not to try to imitate his highly-wrought outpourings when tippy-tapping\
  \ my own prose. Long-time readers may recall what happened to Dobson when he fell\
  \ under Shiel's spell\u2026\n\n[2010-11-15]"
