text: "Q\u2014Dear Mr Key, I read with great interest your piece on swarfega pitfalls.\
  \ I myself have often experienced swarfega pratfalls. I think it would be very helpful\
  \ for your readers if you could provide a clear, comprehensive, and slightly hysterical\
  \ explanatory string of paragraphs on the differences between pitfalls and pratfalls.\
  \ Should you require my assistance in this matter, I am available for interview\
  \ at the corner table in Old Ma Popsicle's Tea Shoppe every day between the crack\
  \ of dawn and the engulfing shroud of pitch black starless night.\nA\u2014My correspondent\
  \ is deluded in thinking there is such a thing as a swarfega pratfall. He or she\
  \ is obviously confusing the phrase with Swarfegaprat Falls, a mighty cataract of\
  \ tumbling water which can be found on the outskirts of Pointy Town. (Turn left\
  \ by the cement statue of Hattie Jacques and keep going until you hear the roar\
  \ and slosh of a mighty cataract of tumbling water.)\n[2017-02-12]"
