text: "\u201CSuch is the immensity of this metropolis, so innumerable are its thoroughfares,\
  \ and so widely separated its districts, that one who had passed half a lifetime\
  \ at the west-end of London might well be excused for entire ignorance as to the\
  \ situation of Bethnal Green, Jacob's Island, Mile-end, and Stepney. They are as\
  \ vaguely remote to many as the Ultima Thule of Orkney or Shetland. It is exceedingly\
  \ probable that we have among our readers thousands who, with or without a map,\
  \ would be utterly unable to point out the localities of Piccadilly Square, Honey-lane\
  \ Market, Hay-Hill, Little Britain, Cloth Fair, Cock-lane, Bell square, Long-alley,\
  \ and Bleeding-heart-yard; and people are born and run their race of life, and die\
  \ within a mile or two of one another, and are as completely estranged from their\
  \ neighbours as though they were separated from them by rocky mountains, by unfordable\
  \ streams, by stormy seas.\n\u201CThis London is an amalgam of worlds within worlds,\
  \ and the occurrences of every day convince us that there is not one of these worlds\
  \ but has its special mysteries and its generic crimes. Exaggeration and ridicule\
  \ often attach to the vastness of London, and the ignorance of its penetralia common\
  \ to us who dwell therein. It has been said that beasts of chase still roam in the\
  \ verdant fastnesses of Grosvenor square, that there are undiscovered patches of\
  \ primaeval forest in Hyde Park and that Hampstead sewers shelter a monstrous breed\
  \ of black swine, which have propagated and run wild among the slimy feculence,\
  \ and whose ferocious snouts will one day up-root Highgate archway, while they make\
  \ Holloway intolerable with their grunting. Seriously that may be said of the Londoner,\
  \ who prides himself on his accurate topographical knowledge, which was said in\
  \ modesty by the great philosopher of light. He is but picking up shells on the\
  \ shore, while all before him lies a vast and undiscovered ocean.\n\u201CIt has\
  \ seemed, however, fated, of late days, that the London public should hear enough\u2014\
  if not, indeed, too much\u2014of the remote and ungenial region at the east end\
  \ of the metropolis. Murders, actions for seduction, fierce theological dissensions,\
  \ followed by alarming riots, robberies, and murderous assaults\u2014such eventualities\
  \ as these have formed the staple of our most recent tidings from the outlying faubourgs\
  \ of White Chapel, Spitalfields, Mile-end, Bow, Stepney, Wapping, and Rotherhithe\u2026\
  \ To the scandalous accounts of church brawls have been lately added the ghastly\
  \ revelations of the charnel house. The last importation from the East-end is the\
  \ revolting story of the surreptitious disposal of the dead body of an infant, the\
  \ illegitimate child of one Elizabeth Yorath, and which was smuggled into the earth\
  \ in the coffin of an adult person, under the auspices of an undertaker in the Borough,\
  \ and a clergyman of the Church of England.\u201D\nEditorial in The Daily Telegraph,\
  \ Monday 10 October 1859, quoted in Black Swine In The Sewers Of Hampstead\_: Beneath\
  \ The Surface Of Victorian Sensationalism by Thomas Boyle (1989)\n[2009-11-07]"
