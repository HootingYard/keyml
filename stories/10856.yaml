text: "The bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead's diary for this day in 1992:\nTo the\
  \ launch party for my new paperback potboiler Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!\
  \ Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! I took the title from Ronald Firbank's 1916 novel Inclinations,\
  \ and I am pleased to think that this may be the first time in the history of fiction\
  \ that an entire chapter of an existing work has been quoted as the title of a new\
  \ one. (It was Chapter XX, for anybody who wants to check.) My Mabel bears scant\
  \ resemblance to Firbank's. She was young and not a little ditzy, while mine is\
  \ a crone. In fact, for a while I thought of giving the book the title Crone With\
  \ A Sponge! until, about half way through, I encountered intractable technical potboiler\
  \ difficulties and had to ditch the sponge entirely, eradicating all mention of\
  \ it from the opening chapters. It is, I think, a better book as a result, certainly\
  \ a better potboiler.\nI attended the launch party incognito, got up as a baffled\
  \ bus conductor down on his luck. My disguise was almost wholly successful, and\
  \ not even my own mother recognised me. What on earth she was doing at the party\
  \ is a surpassing mystery. I must have words with the warden of the Bewilderment\
  \ Home. Though nobody actually knew me for who I am, one fathead mistook me for\
  \ the lumbering psychopathic walrus-moustached serial killer Babinsky, and called\
  \ the coppers. They arrived just as I was cramming cream crackers from the buffet\
  \ into the pocket of my bus conductor's jacket. Never overlook free cream crackers,\
  \ by the way\u2014follow that advice and you can sail through life more or less\
  \ unhindered.\nNot so this evening, alas, as the coppers, led by doughty Detective\
  \ Captain Cargpan, whacked me on the head several times with a lead-weighted sap,\
  \ removed the cream crackers from my pocket and put them back on the buffet table,\
  \ and bundled me into the back of their van. I assumed I would be taken down to\
  \ the station, but instead we drove out into the blasted and inhospitable winter\
  \ countryside. At a godforsaken spinney, the van screeched to a halt and the coppers\
  \ dragged me out and tied me to the trunk of a yew tree. The yew tree pointed up,\
  \ it had a Gothic shape. My eyes lifted after it and found the moon. I noticed that\
  \ fumy, spiritous mists inhabited this place, and there was a row of headstones.\n\
  \u201CI have decided that the only way to stop you, Babinsky, is to engage in a\
  \ spot of extra-judicial killing,\u201D said Cargpan. Then, \u201CNed, get the axe\
  \ and the shovel,\u201D he added, to one of his henchmen.\n\u201CBut I am not Babinsky!\u201D\
  \ I cried, \u201CI am the bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead!\u201D\n\u201CProve\
  \ it,\u201D said Cargpan, darkly.\n\u201CMy hands are tied to the trunk of this\
  \ pointy yew tree so I cannot rummage in my pockets, but if you do so, in among\
  \ the crumbs of cream crackers you will find my jotter, in which are jotted down\
  \ notes for my next half dozen bestselling paperback potboilers,\u201D I said.\n\
  Cargpan rummaged, and a look of wonderment lit up his countenance.\n\u201CBloody\
  \ hell, boys, this isn't Babinsky, it's Pebblehead!\u201D he cried, and he immediately\
  \ freed me from my bonds and sat me down on a camping stool and gave me a cup of\
  \ tea from a flask.\n\u201CWe are all big fans of yours,\u201D he said, as his little\
  \ band of coppers all nodded, \u201CWe've got every single one of your books down\
  \ at the station. If we take you back there, will you sign them for us?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Of course I will,\u201D I said, \u201CIf, afterwards, you will return me to the\
  \ launch party for Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!\u201D\
  \n\u201CBetter than that,\u201D said Cargpan, \u201CWe will throw a party for you\
  \ ourselves. I don't know if you have ever been to a coppers\u2019 party, Mr P.,\
  \ but we can guarantee you a splendid time.\u201D\nAnd so it turned out that I ended\
  \ the evening absolutely stuffed with cream crackers, wearing a paper hat, and regaling\
  \ a basement full of coppers with piquant anecdotes of the literary life. More to\
  \ the point, I gathered invaluable material for my forthcoming bestselling paperback\
  \ potboiler Tied To A Yew Tree By Coppers! (working title), which I should have\
  \ finished by late tomorrow afternoon.\n[2013-01-19]"
