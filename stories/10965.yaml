text: "I decided not to extend the daily diary entries theme beyond the end of January,\
  \ for the simple reason that I suspect it might become somewhat restrictive and\
  \ also unforgivably dull. So there will be no overarching theme at Hooting Yard\
  \ this year, just scrapings from the interior bran tub of my brain as and when they\
  \ occur. Such scrapings may include the occasional thousandish-word essay \u201C\
  On\u2026\u201D a particular topic, and indeed the occasional diary entry, from the\
  \ great or the not so great or the frankly fictional, but if so they will be slotted\
  \ in alongside general witterings, insights, reportage, sweeping paragraphs of majestic\
  \ prose, and whatnot.\n[2013-02-02]"
