text: "\nWe all know that God spelled backwards is Dog, but it is not commonly pointed\
  \ out that Ergo spelled backwards is Ogre. This insight can lead us to faff about\
  \ with Descartes\u2019 famous dictum cogito ergo sum so that, instead of stating\
  \ I think therefore I am, we say instead I think I am an ogre.\nIt could be argued\
  \ that this is actually a more profound statement than Descartes\u2019 original.\
  \ It could be, and it has. In a new book, the paperbackist Pebblehead takes cogito\
  \ ogre sum as his starting point, and weaves a tale staggering in its implications.\n\
  \u201CI am known for my potboilers\u201D said Pebblehead, speaking from his chalet\
  \ o\u2019 prose high in the Swiss Alps, smoking his pipe, \u201CFat paperbacks with\
  \ garish covers sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like. With my new book,\
  \ I like to think I have created an entirely new genre, which I have dubbed the\
  \ \u2018potboiler of profundity\u2019. This is a fat paperback with a garish cover\
  \ sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like which, in terms of deep mind-numbing\
  \ profundity, can stand alongside the deepest and most mind-numbing and most profound\
  \ works in the canon.\u201D\nBashed out in just two weeks of frantic typing, Pebblehead's\
  \ potboiler of profundity tells the story of a man who thinks he is an ogre. It\
  \ poses questions which delve into the core of the human soul. If I think I am an\
  \ ogre, am I an ogre? If I think I am an ogre but I am not an ogre, what, then,\
  \ am I? Why would I think I am an ogre in the first place? Am I hairy and brutish\
  \ and savage? Do I grunt rather than speak articulate words? If so, how do I manage\
  \ to narrate this potboiler of profundity in such punchy prose, daddy-o? Answer\
  \ me that, or I'll tear your head off with my bare hands, or rather paws, yes, great\
  \ hairy paws, suitable for an ogre. And when I've torn your head off I'll carry\
  \ it back to my lair, a dark dank cave, full of bats, where I lurk, grunting and\
  \ slobbering, ogreishly.\nWith your head torn off and tossed on to the pile of other\
  \ torn-off human heads in the corner of my cave, you won't be able to continue reading\
  \ my fat paperback with a garish cover sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the\
  \ like, will you? You won't be able to read, and you won't be able to think. And\
  \ if you can't read and you can't think, can you still call yourself civilised,\
  \ or are you, too, now merely an ogre, albeit one without a head? Ultimately, are\
  \ we not, all of us, wandering the world like headless ogres, searching for our\
  \ torn-off heads, tossed onto piles of other torn-off heads in the corners of dark\
  \ dank caves? Is one of those caves Plato's cave? Was Plato, too, an ogre? And if\
  \ Plato was an ogre, what of\_Ren\xE9\_Descartes? And what of you?\nThe latest news\
  \ from Pebblehead is that his own brain has been so bedizened by the writing of\
  \ his potboiler of profundity that he is currently languishing, exhausted, on the\
  \ balcony of a sanatorium even higher in the Swiss Alps. His book is available at\
  \ all good airport bookstalls. We wish him well.\n[2017-11-04]"
