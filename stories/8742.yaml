text: "In the course of a blog postage recounting \u201CA Day In The Life\u201D, Outa_Spaceman\
  \ describes his experience of listening to yesterday's edition of Hooting Yard On\
  \ The Air on Resonance104.4FM, broadcast, as ever, live:\nPrep and light the fire,\
  \ hang washing on clothes airer and get comfortable for Hooting Yard on the Air.\n\
  Familiar strains of the Caucasian Lullaby fade into horrific coughing and spluttering,\
  \ \u2018Oh God\u2019 intones the despairing voice of Mr. Key, Caucasian Lullaby\
  \ cuts back in and plays for a distressingly long time. I begin to worry that I\
  \ might actually have heard Mr. Key's last gasp. Caucasian Lullaby fades again and\
  \ Mr. Key resumes the entertainment that I know and love as Hooting Yard on the\
  \ Air.\nWrite email to congratulate Mr. Key on best start (in hindsight) to Hooting\
  \ Yard on the Air ever.\nI did indeed manage to time a fit of strangulated choking\
  \ perfectly to coincide with the start of the programme. At 6.30 PM, I was fine\
  \ and chipper. Ten or fifteen seconds later I was racked by heaving convulsive coughs\
  \ and, as I signalled wildly for John, the sound engineer, to bring the music back\
  \ up, I was unable to breathe. I then staggered out of the studio to the kitchen\
  \ to get a beaker of water, where I heard, from the office above, the voice of Resonance\
  \ supremo Ed Baxter calling \u201CTerrific beginning to the show, Frank!\u201D\n\
  I gulped down water and gradually regained my composure. Such are the joys of live\
  \ radio.\n[2012-03-23]"
