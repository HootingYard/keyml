text: "Never one to be troubled by the chronology of cultural fads, poet Dennis Beerpint\
  \ is trying to reinvent himself as a beatnik. He has been seen about town sporting\
  \ a goatee beard and a jet black polo neck sweater. A concerned Beerpint-watcher\
  \ suspects a copy of Allen Ginsberg's Howl may have fallen into his hands.\n\u201C\
  Knowing Dennis Beerpint,\u201D writes my correspondent, \u201CHis version of Howl\
  \ will probably be called Bleat or Oooh, Missus!\u201D\nThis seems a bit harsh to\
  \ me. Though Beerpint can be incorrigibly twee, and often fatuous, at its best his\
  \ work has reduced me to a sincerely sobbing heap of woebane. I am thinking of such\
  \ pieces as Lines Upon The Collision Of A Little Peewit With A Hot Air Balloon,\
  \ a poem I consider to be the finest peewit-related poem of the last millennium.\
  \ It will be interesting to see where he goes in his new beatnik persona, daddy-o.\
  \ Well, perhaps not interesting, but at the very least mildly diverting in a Beerpinty\
  \ way for those of us who follow his doings.\n[2009-02-20]"
