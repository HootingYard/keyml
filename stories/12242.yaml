text: "\nThe monopod flautist Ian Anderson once sang about the time \u201Cwhen the\
  \ Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree\u201D. I have no idea what he was\
  \ going on about, and I suspect Mr Anderson may just have wanted something to rhyme\
  \ with the \u201Csea\u201D and \u201Cto be\u201D endings of the preceding lines\
  \ in his song.\nIn any case, it is the time before the apple returned to the Garden\
  \ of Eden that concerns me today, over in my cupboard at The Dabbler, the editor\
  \ of which found this splendidly apt picture with which to illustrate the piece.\n\
