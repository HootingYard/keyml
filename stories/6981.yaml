text: "At time of writing, Krishnan Guru-Murthy has nudged ahead of Yoko Ono in our\
  \ poll to decide on the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard\
  \ lapel accoutrement. Could it be, I wonder, that the email I fired off to him at\
  \ Channel 4 News the other day bore fruit?\nDear Mr Guru-Murthy\nYou are currently\
  \ in second place (behind Yoko Ono) in a readers\u2019 poll at Hooting Yard to choose\
  \ the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard lapel accoutrement.\
  \ Might I suggest you vote for yourself and encourage others in the Channel 4 newsroom\
  \ to cast their votes in your favour?\nClearly something is going right, as many\
  \ of my readers may be under the impression you are a fictional character, and they\
  \ still vote for you!\nYours sincerely\nFrank Key\nSome readers may be appalled\
  \ by what they see as a morally reprehensible attempt to influence the outcome of\
  \ the poll. Let me assure these virtuous souls that I fully intend to fire off similar\
  \ letters to De Botton, Huffington, Tempah, and Ono. But not Balls, for Christ's\
  \ sake, not Balls!\n[2011-07-26]"
