text: "[Please note that I follow the Geoffrey Willans / St Custard's spelling \u2018\
  foopball\u2019 throughout, as part of my campaign to supplant the more common, yet\
  \ erroneous, spelling of the word.]\nBetween the ages of about seven and fourteen,\
  \ I had two overwhelming passions, foopball and nisbet spotting. I have written\
  \ about the latter earlier, though it is a topic of abiding interest so I shall\
  \ probably return to it from time to time. Foopball, it turned out, did not abide,\
  \ in my case. I went from fanatical interest to caring not a jot seemingly overnight,\
  \ though I suppose it must have been a more gradual process. Ever since, there have\
  \ been occasional faint stirrings of the old enthusiasm, for example during World\
  \ Cup tournaments, but it never holds my attention for long. And in thinking about\
  \ it, I realise that foopball itself\u2014foopball as foopball\u2014was never the\
  \ real focus of my youthful absorption.\nI played, but ineptly\u2014myopia tends\
  \ to limit one's abilities on the pitch. I went to a few live matches, but not many.\
  \ I watched a lot of foopball on television, but then as now, I had no real appreciation\
  \ of what I was looking at. The finer points always eluded me. Superb displays of\
  \ skill, when they occasionally occur, are obvious and breathtaking, but the general\
  \ run of games, twenty-two chaps darting about (if near the ball) or strolling around\
  \ (if far from it) is enormously tedious. I never quite manage to comprehend the\
  \ tactical blather of commentators and pundits, in terms of what I am seeing. What\
  \ I was fanatical about, when young, was reading about it.\nMore precisely, I read\
  \ the history. I was less interested in contemporary doings, match reports, transfer\
  \ speculations, and whatnot, than I was in the past. One of my favourite players\
  \ was Steve Bloomer, \u201Cthe Daisycutter\u201D, and he retired before the First\
  \ World War. I pored over books and encyclopaedias and part-works, hoovering up\
  \ and retaining an incredible amount of information. I have forgotten it all now,\
  \ but at the time I could have recited a list of every league champion and every\
  \ FA Cup winner, told you the scores of every FA Cup Final and every World Cup Final\
  \ and every European Cup Final, and on and on ad nauseam. That this had anything\
  \ at all to do with the brute reality of chaps kicking a ball around on grass was,\
  \ I now understand, incidental. Had I taken it into my head to pursue any other\
  \ subject\u2014cricket, or stamp collecting, or ornithology\u2014and pursued it\
  \ with the same single-minded devotion, I would merely have stuffed my head with\
  \ a different body of knowledge.\nAnd I further realise that never, since, have\
  \ I concentrated my mind so determinedly on one particular subject. In adulthood,\
  \ it has been my way to flit from one thing to another, magpie like, with the result\
  \ that I know a little about a lot, but could never consider myself an expert on\
  \ anything. What if, today, I decided to immerse myself in a topic as deeply as\
  \ I immersed myself in foopball all those years ago? I was certainly an expert then.\
  \ Perhaps, with age, my brain has shrivelled, and would no longer be capable of\
  \ the feats of concentration and memory which once came so easily.\nThe few memories\
  \ I do retain from my foopball fanaticism are fragmentary. If pushed, I could still\
  \ name every player in England's World Cup winning side of 1966. Equally, I could\
  \ list those who died and those who survived the 1958 Munich Air Disaster. That,\
  \ incidentally, being the then recent past, I considered the signal event of the\
  \ twentieth century. I mourned Duncan Edwards with soppy sentimentality.\nI remember\
  \ Puskas and Di Stefano. I remember Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. I remember a player\
  \ named Derek Dooley whose career ended when he was badly injured and had his leg\
  \ amputated, and the goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who was also badly injured\u2014\
  a broken neck\u2014but carried on playing in a cup final. I remember the \u201C\
  Matthews final\u201D of 1953. Well, for all of the above I should say rather that\
  \ I \u201Cremember\u201D them, for they were all before my time, they were already\
  \ in the past. Foopball was something that happened in grainy black and white.\n\
  There was history, and there were words. Foopball provided many instances to feed\
  \ my fascination with words. Why were Real Madrid called Real Madrid? Was there\
  \ an Unreal Madrid, or a Pretend Madrid? Later on, towards the end of my foopball\
  \ days, as other areas of human activity began to impinge upon my consciousness,\
  \ I wondered if there was a Surreal Madrid. Very likely, I thought, given that as\
  \ far as I understood surrealism equalled Salvador Dali, and he was Spanish.\nThere\
  \ was (probably still is) a Scottish team called Partick Thistle. I misread this\
  \ at first as Patrick Thistle, but after realising my mistake I concocted the idea\
  \ that the manager ought to be scouting the country for a promising young player\
  \ called Patrick Thistle, just so he could sign him and make him team captain.\n\
  I devised a \u201Cdream team\u201D of players whose surnames were also the names\
  \ of birds\u2014Partridge, Finch, Pratincole\u2014and another of players who shared\
  \ their names with my schoolteachers. And I recall at one point creating an alternative\
  \ foopball league, of ninety-two teams whose names were anagrams of the ninety-two\
  \ teams in the real league.\nAll the while I was thus happily occupied, every Saturday\
  \ chaps were kicking a ball around on grass. But what did that matter to me? Oh,\
  \ I thought it did. But it didn't.\n[2012-08-28]"
