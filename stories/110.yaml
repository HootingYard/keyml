text: "Sir Thomas Browne tells us, in Pseudodoxia Epidemica:\nThere is found in the\
  \ Summer a kind of Spider called a Tainct, of a red colour, and so little of body\
  \ that ten of the largest will hardly outway a grain; this by Country people is\
  \ accounted a deadly poison unto Cows and Horses; who, if they suddenly die, and\
  \ swell thereon, ascribe their death hereto, and will commonly say, they have licked\
  \ a Tainct. Now to satisfie the doubts of men we have called this tradition unto\
  \ experiment; we have given hereof unto Dogs, Chickens, Calves and Horses, and not\
  \ in the singular in number; yet never could find the least disturbance ensue. There\
  \ must be therefore other causes enquired of the sudden death and swelling of cattle;\
  \ and perhaps this insect is mistaken, and unjustly accused for some other. For\
  \ some there are which from elder times have been observed pernicious unto cattle,\
  \ as the Buprestis or Burstcow, the Pityocampe or Eruca Pinnum, by Dioscorides,\
  \ Galen and \xC6tius, the Staphilinus described by Aristotle and others, or those\
  \ red Phalangious Spiders like Cantharides mentioned by Muffetus. Now although the\
  \ animal may be mistaken and the opinion also false, yet in the ground and reason\
  \ which makes men most to doubt the verity hereof, there may be truth enough, that\
  \ is, the inconsiderable quantity of this insect. For that a poison cannot destroy\
  \ in so small a bulk; we have no reason to affirm. For if as Leo Africanus reporteth,\
  \ the tenth part of a grain of the poison of Nubia, will dispatch a man in two hours;\
  \ if the bite of a Viper and sting of a Scorpion, is not conceived to impart so\
  \ much; if the bite of an Asp will kill within an hour, yet the impression scarce\
  \ visible, and the poison communicated not ponderable; we cannot as impossible reject\
  \ this way of destruction; or deny the power of death in so narrow a circumscription.\n\
