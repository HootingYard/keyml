  \ use of the powder to them by putting it in anything of substance, wherein it will\
  \ not swim a-top of the water.\u201D\nThe father, feeling unwell, frequently took\
  \ water gruel. This was a proper vehicle for the powder.\n\u201COn Sunday morning,\
  \ I again examined Mr Blandy. He seemed much relieved, but, on viewing his fundament,\
  \ I found it almost surrounded with gleety excoriations and ulcers.\u201D\n\u201C\
  I always thought there was mischief in those cursed Scotch pebbles.\u201D\nFour\
