  \ The Dabbler to the unresolved question of which bird she most closely resembled.\
  \ I noted that Matthew Parris claimed \u201Cshe walked like a partridge\u201D, while\
  \ Jon Snow asserted \u201Cshe scuttled about like a hen\u201D. Now things have become\
  \ more complicated. Reading Dominic Sandbrook's Seasons In The Sun\_: The Battle\
  \ For Britain 1974\u20131979, I learn that the Daily Express compared the then-future\
  \ Prime Minister to \u201Can angry woodpecker\u201D.\n[2014-03-30]"
