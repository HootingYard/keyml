text: "I am indebted to reader Mike Jennings who, despite being banished to a pompous\
  \ land, has, in his own words, been \u201Ccompiling these tentative notes toward\
  \ a Dobson bibliography\u201D. This seems to me to be a work of magnificent scholarship.\
  \ Indeed, I cannot begin to imagine how we have all been coping without it.\nMr\
  \ Jennings adds \u201CMuch work is to be done of course with regard to details such\
  \ as binding, font, illustration etc but I know my limitations.\_ Such scrutiny\
  \ I will leave to more qualified Dobsonists with the requisite anoraks and little\
  \ grease-proof bags of egg sandwiches.\u201D\nThe bibliography is ordered according\
  \ to an arcane system of Mr Jennings\u2019 own devising, one the intrinsic beauty\
  \ of which I hope we can all appreciate. I have taken the liberty of applying a\
  \ set of Bl\xF6tzmann Numbers to the pamphlet titles. Though broadly similar to\
  \ ordinary numbers, they of course harbour a terrifying underlying significance.\
  \ To paraphrase H P Lovecraft, \u201Cthe most merciful thing in the world is the\
