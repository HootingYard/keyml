text: "\u201COh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and\
  \ plaice\u201D is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer. This has\
  \ the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is\
  \ why you will rarely hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that,\
  \ within the rolling cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish,\
  \ both edible and inedible, are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial\
  \ monomaniac named Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger, nor\
  \ indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little\
  \ man whose ears were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if they had\
  \ been stuck to his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought to have\
  \ been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders. Nine\
  \ times out of ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock's case it\
  \ had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon\
  \ his brain after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and\
  \ the mongering of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside vicars still\
  \ include an abridged version of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer in their services.\
  \ But not many.\n[2008-11-19]"
