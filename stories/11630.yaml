text: "For me, the highlight of the recent Old Scratchy Black And White Newsreel Footage\
  \ Of Tiny Fascists Film Festival was the exceedingly rare old scratchy black and\
  \ white newsreel footage of Tiny Enid. The plucky fascist tot was filmed, possibly\
  \ in the Old Town of Plovdiv, clomping along a street, in a polka dot dress, dragging\
  \ behind her her club foot and withered leg.\nThis latter detail allows us to date\
  \ the footage fairly precisely. In her Memoirs, written in her dotage, Tiny Enid\
  \ recalled what she dubbed \u201Cthe year of rotating withers\u201D:\nThen it so\
  \ happened that I awoke one morning to discover that my left leg\u2014the one which\
  \ ends in a perfectly normal, as opposed to a club, foot\u2014was withered. Being\
  \ a brave and plucky tot I did not whimper, as so many girlies would have done,\
  \ but dragged myself downstairs and tucked into my breakfast of milk slops, after\
  \ which I got on with my day as usual.\nThe next day, Tuesday, my leg was still\
  \ withered. But when I woke up on Wednesday, my left leg was as sound as before,\
  \ but my left arm was withered. This withering lasted for three days, until the\
  \ Saturday morning, when it was my right arm that was withered, while my left arm\
  \ was wholly unwithered. Come Sunday, my right arm was back to normal but my right\
  \ leg was withered.\nAnd so it went on, turn and turn about, limb by limb. Only\
  \ one was ever withered at a time, but invariably one of the four, either an arm\
  \ or a leg, was withered, every day. Of course I coped admirably with these witherings,\
  \ and never uttered a word of complaint, but I did wonder if I might ever return\
  \ to being fully sound of limb, permanently, apart of course from my club foot.\n\
  It occurred to me that the unwithering of one and the withering of another must\
  \ of necessity take place while I slept, for it was a discovery I made each morning\
  \ when the alarm clock jangled me awake at six. I thus decided to forego sleep,\
  \ and kept myself awake by singing rousing songs and smashing crockery. However,\
  \ even as plucky a tot as I could only remain awake for so long before, as a poet\
  \ might put it, the waters of Lethe closed over my head. When I woke up, my right\
  \ leg, which had been withered, was unwithered, and my left leg was withered.\n\
  Eventually, and not before time, I decided to consult a physician. There was newly\
  \ arrived in town a doctor with the splendidly appropriate name Ague-Palsy. I rapped\
  \ my knuckles on his door, was ushered in, and he took one look at me and announced,\
  \ in his gravelly voice, that I was suffering from rotating withers. This was not\
  \ a malady I had ever heard of before, obviously, or I would have been able to diagnose\
  \ it myself.\nDr Ague-Palsy proved to be an experimentalist. He was working at that\
  \ time with an entirely new type of gas which he had either discovered or invented,\
  \ it was never clear to me which. He prescribed a series of daily \u201Cgas baths\u201D\
  . The basic idea was that I filled the tub with piping hot water, pumped some of\
  \ his gas into it, and then splashed about, playing with my toy ducks, for half\
  \ an hour. A week of this regime, he said, and each of my four limbs would be free\
  \ from withering for the foreseeable future.\nI am pleased to report that this experimental\
  \ treatment proved highly efficacious, and at the end of the week I was completely\
  \ cured of rotating withers. He did not warn me of the side-effects of his new gas,\
  \ which made me three times as plucky and reckless and fascistic as I had been before\u2014\
  so that was an added boon!\n[2013-06-19]"
