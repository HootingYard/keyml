text: "This is the first in our important series \u201CBreakfasts Of Kings\u201D in\
  \ which we cast a beady eye on the breakfast preferences of various monarchs throughout\
  \ history.\nKing Leopold II of Belgium ate six poached eggs, an enormous number\
  \ of slices of toast, and an entire jar of marmalade for his breakfast each day.\n\
  Leopold spoke French, rather than Flemish, so he did not refer to his breakfast\
  \ as \u201Chet ontbijt\u201D, as Mr Key does, usually.\nADDENDUM\_: It concerns\
  \ not just breakfast but every daily meal, and it is not a king writing, but this\
  \ quotation from the journals of Roger Casement is worth noting: \u201CChicken,\
  \ chicken, custard, custard\u2026 every day\u2026 Goddam\u201D. Casement's meals\
  \ at the time (1903) were prepared by a cook known only as \u201CHairy Bill\u201D\
