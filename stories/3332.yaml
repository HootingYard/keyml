text: "\nThis is Shirley Hibberd\u2014or James Shirley Hibberd to give his full name\u2014\
  a Victorian writer and horticulturalist (1825\u20131890). I draw him to your attention\
  \ apropos of nothing in particular. By all accounts he was a prolific author, churning\
  \ out books and articles on many subjects apart from his specialist field. He wrote\
  \ beautifully. Consider this, from \u201CThe Instincts And Habits Of Bees\u201D\
  , published in The Intellectual Observer\_: Review Of Natural History, Microscopic\
  \ Research And Recreative Science, Volume VI (1865).\n\u201CIf a man has but one\
  \ stock of bees and is of the right temper to make pets of them, his attachment\
  \ to them will grow so surely that it will be strange if he does not, in a very\
  \ short time, renounce many a commonplace pleasure in order to make room in his\
  \ heart for a strong affection for these happy confectioners, and perhaps appropriate\
  \ a portion of his head to an investigation of their instincts and habits, so as\
  \ to prove for himself all the written records of bee history, and live in hope\
  \ of adding to them the results of personal observation.\u201D\nI appropriated a\
  \ portion of my head to wondering who this reminded me of. I appropriated another\
  \ portion of my head to discovering the titles of some of the books of this proto-Dobson.\
  \ They include:\nThe Seaweed Collector: A Handy Guide To The Marine Botanist Suggesting\
  \ What To Look For, And Where To Go In The Study Of The British Algae And The British\
  \ Sponges (1872)\nClever Dogs, Horses, Etc (1868)\nThe Golden Gate And Silver Steps,\
  \ With Bits Of Tinsel Round About (1886)\nWater-Cresses Without Sewage (1878)\n\
  And, in 1856, this:\n\nThe photograph of Shirley Hibberd, by an unknown snappist,\
  \ is copyright The Oxford Dictionary Of National Biography.\n[2009-10-28]"
