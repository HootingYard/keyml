text: "Perhaps the least-known of the Swabian hotheads, so obscure that we do not\
  \ know his name, and have never known it, can be seen in the bottom left corner\
  \ of a mezzotint by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint, where he is to be seen in full\
  \ Swabian hothead mode, suitably attired and, we surmise, purple-faced in the throes\
  \ of tempest, though the mezzotint is monochrome, yet purple we see, by dint of\
  \ Rex Tint's artistic chops, honed, if his sister Dot Tint's memoir is to believed,\
  \ and why should it not?, upon Tyrolean peaks, in inclement weather, with pencil\
  \ and paper, and a pipe stuck in his mouth, as gales howled around him, scribbling\
  \ furiously with the same scribbly fury he would bring, famously, later, oh! years\
  \ later, to his depiction, so gauche yet valiant, of the Swabian hothead in the\
  \ corner of a mezzotint otherwise empty of human figures, a picture populated largely\
  \ by cows, and herons, or moorhens, or some other birds, for as was often said of\
  \ Rex Tint, not least by his sister Dot Tint, in her memoir, if there was one thing\
  \ the maestro could not do, for love nor money, it was to draw accurately any of\
  \ the birds which God created to bless the skies, if, that is, that was the reason\
  \ for their divine invention, during the seven days of creation, or rather six,\
  \ six, I am forgetting that on the seventh day He rested, just as Rex Tint liked\
  \ to take a day off from his indefatigable mezzotinting at least once a week, usually\
  \ on a Thursday, when he would prop up the bar at his local kloppisguelph and knock\
  \ back an entire litre of absinthe, in homage to the habits of his hero Ernst Ludwig\
  \ Kirchner (1880\u20131938), but so unlike the Swabian hothead, who never rested\
  \ at all, never, never, so hot was his head that it never allowed him to rest, at\
  \ least not when he was in Swabia, and he was always in Swabia, as far as we know,\
  \ he never went further afield, they wouldn't let him, they'd've stopped him at\
  \ the border, forbidden him to cross, wisely, it has to be said, wisely, for who\
  \ can guess at the enormities that would ensue if once the Swabian hothead were\
  \ given entirely fresh territories in which to be a hothead?, it fair boggles the\
  \ brain, mine at least, and possibly yours too, though I cannot guarantee it, even\
  \ if you have been concentrating hard, and furrowing your brow, and chewing the\
  \ end of the pencil with which, I hope, you have been taking notes, scribbling furiously,\
  \ like Rex Tint atop a Tyrolean peak, all those years ago, smoking his pipe, swept\
  \ by gales, that will do for the time being.\n[2015-10-14]"
