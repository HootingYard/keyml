  \ in \u201CJane's Gone To France\u201D. But for those of you keen to see the resurrection\
  \ of perhaps the most important beat combo ever to mention Marshal Petain in a song,\
  \ here are some cuttings culled from distant outposts of Interwebshire.\nFirst,\
  \ two reviews of the magnum opus itself, from a couple of local rags. Please note\
  \ that a young Mr Key did not write either of them.\n\n\nSecond, unfortunately as\
  \ low in resolution as he was high in importance, Bloch himself, on stage.\n\n[2011-04-21]"
