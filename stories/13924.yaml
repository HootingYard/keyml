text: 'While shepherds watched their flocks at night on Pugton Hill the wind blew
  wild and there were shimmerings or ghostly gleams. One shepherd had a wristwatch
  and told the time to the other two. Down below Pugton Hill on the main arterial
  road huge container lorries thundered past on their way to the ferry. The shepherds
  smoked their pipes. The lorries too belched smoke for there were no laws in place
  to stop them so doing. Nor were there speed limits. Crashes and pile-ups and terrible
  accidents were common at that time in that place below Pugton Hill. When they heard
  or saw dimly in the black night a grievous traffic incident the shepherds laughed
  for their hearts were cold and void of human sympathy. They preferred the company
  of nocturnal sheep wide awake and terrified as sheep are for most of their time
  on earth and on Pugton Hill. So slowly the hands of the wristwatch tock off the
  minutes and the hours. The shepherds are waiting for a sign. There is no signage
  on the main arterial road save for an occasional arrow pointing towards the ferry.
  No sign points the way back for none of the huge speeding lorries ever comes back.
  They carry the contents of the country load by load to the ferry and never return
  past Pugton Hill atop which the shepherds smoke and laugh and are fiercely protective
  of their terrified sheep. Glory be for yes it is a kind of glory up there above
  the road as the wind blows wild in the night on Pugton Hill.
