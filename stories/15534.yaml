text: "Cocking a snook is an age-old custom in Pointy Town, harking back to the days\
  \ of Bruno La Poubelle, or even earlier. It is unrelated to the snook-cocking practised\
  \ elsewhere in the world. That is not the same thing at all. No it is not, oh no.\
  \ No.\nWhat am I talking about, then, when I talk about the specifically Pointy\
  \ Town practice\u2014or praxis, as the postmodernist philosopher Jean-Luc Postmod\
  \ would put it\u2014of cocking a snook? Am I just babbling incoherently? No, I am\
  \ not, oh no. Not at all.\nWe may go back to the ur-text in this matter, the centuries-old\
  \ Great Book of Bruno La Poubelle, in which we find this passage. Granted, to the\
  \ modern reader it is gibberish, but bear with me. Have patience. This is what we\
  \ read:\nWheat! Goosepeck ouch. Sit, Fido. Rubber papa hemingway in storm drains.\
  \ Kew Rhone sow's ear, wah wah pedal bin. Birds without ears. Oo look teabag. Hen\
  \ coop protocol baffling. Fiery, fiery Fido sit. Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis.\
  \ Religio medici urn burial. Early Scritti, natty Jah, natty cock, natty snook,\
  \ natty dread.\nRoughly translated, this means \u2026 well, it is so roughly translated\
  \ it can hardly be called a translation. I for one can make head nor tail of it.\
  \ The important point is that the words \u201Ccock\u201D and \u201Csnook\u201D can\
  \ both be spotted in the passage, and in close proximity, so that tells us something.\
  \ What does it tell us? At the very least, it tells us that both \u201Ccock\u201D\
  \ and \u201Csnook\u201D were words in usage in Pointy Town at the time of the composition\
  \ of the Great Book of Bruno La Poubelle. So we are getting somewhere. Oh yes we\
  \ are.\nWhen I suffered a burst appendix, and they put me on a stretcher, I had\
  \ visions. Yes I did, I'm not making this up. One of these visions was of an ancient\
  \ Pointy Towner, out gathering snooks. I saw the vision as if through a mist, a\
  \ thick mist, such that I could not clearly discern the Pointy Towner. Put it like\
  \ this, I wouldn't be able to identify him in a police line-up. The same is true\
  \ of the snooks he was gathering. Oh thick, thick mist! How you blurred my sight\
  \ as I lay on that stretcher with a burst appendix!\nIn another vision, following\
  \ swiftly on the first, the ancient Pointy Towner was cocking the snooks he'd gathered.\
  \ This, too, was obscured by mist, more's the pity. And more's the potty, if you\
  \ want to know, and I'm sure you do. I'm quite sure. Oh yes I am. There was a hell\
  \ of a lot of pottiness abroad at that time. What a time it was! A potty time, pottier\
  \ than ever before or after, even now \u2026\nNow the gold is turned to lead\n \
  \ And you are lying in your bed\n  With curtains drawn across the night\n  Oh hug\
  \ your pillow! Hug it tight\n  Though you may plead and you may pray\n  The Grunty\
  \ Man is on his way!\n[2017-08-08]"
