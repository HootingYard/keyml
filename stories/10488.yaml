text: "I have been thinking for some time now that it would be a very good idea to\
  \ publish a bestiary. The Hooting Yard Book o\u2019 Beasts would be an ornament\
  \ to any library. Of course, before publishing it I would have to write the thing,\
  \ but it may be that I could compile an anthology based on extant texts. (A similar\
  \ approach, taking selected extracts from my work to illuminate particular subject\
  \ matter, is currently being pursued by the artist James Beckett. His lavish book\
  \ of \u201CWorks\u201D, subtitled \u201CWith constant interjections by Frank Key\u201D\
  , is currently in preparation, due out early next year. I will keep you informed.)\n\
  The best format for my bestiary, I think, would be to follow an alphabetic scheme,\
  \ thus A is for Anaconda, B is for Bird, C is for Cow, etc. Let us consider, for\
  \ a moment, just those three. It strikes me that I may not have mentioned, anywhere\
  \ in my teeming morass of verbiage, the anaconda. So I might have to make up something\
  \ new and snakey. With birds, however, I am on firmer ground. Indeed, I have to\
  \ admit that one of the compelling motives for compiling a bestiary in the first\
  \ place is the opportunity it would give me to show off my quite startling\u2014\
  and starling\u2014ornithological knowledge. I know for a fact that I have several\
  \ readers who only come here, daily, for what they call the \u201Cbirdy stuff\u201D\
  , and who grow quite impatient if I neglect to make mention of birds for any period\
  \ of time. They tend to write intemperate letters, packed with invective, making\
  \ known their disapproval. Often I find, within the envelopes, vestiges of feather,\
  \ and the occasional regurgitated owl pellet.\nSomebody less conscientious would\
  \ crumple these letters and toss them into a wastepaper basket unread. Not me. I\
  \ read and reread them, several times, making annotations in the margins with a\
  \ propelling pencil, and then I file them away in a large and imposing padlocked\
  \ filing cabinet. Let me give you an example of one such letter. I have redacted\
  \ the whingey whiny complaining bit where my correspondent moans that I haven't\
  \ mentioned birds for a few days, leaving the part I wish to advert to, which demonstrates\
  \ how valuable a resource Hooting Yard can prove to be for the otherwise bird-ignorant.\n\
  Dear Mr Key, [dozens of pages redacted]. Before I read Hooting Yard, I used to be\
  \ mystified by the sight of things with wings and beaks and feathers and talons\
  \ flying around in the air, sometimes swooping, sometimes gliding. I had no idea\
  \ what they were. Occasionally one of these things would come to rest on the branch\
  \ of a tree or on a fencepost, and then I would try to take a closer look, but at\
  \ my approach, panting and snorting and stamping towards it in my big heavy boots,\
  \ it would invariably take to the air again and fly away, to the point of invisibility.\
  \ As the years went by I became increasingly fretful and flummoxed, and I consulted\
  \ both opticians, in case there was something wrong with my eyesight, and brain\
  \ doctors, in case there was something wrong with my brain. Then, a couple of weeks\
  \ ago, I had a curious dream in which the words \u201CHooting\u201D and \u201CYard\u201D\
  \ were repeatedly shouted into my ear by a dwarf named Crepusco. I am exceedingly\
  \ tall, but Crepusco was standing on a stool. When I woke up, the words were still\
  \ echoing inside my head, so I looked them up in a large and imposing leather-bound\
  \ reference book. Individually, they did not appear to signal anything significant.\
  \ I determined to forget about the dream and to concern myself with more pressing\
  \ matters, such as eating my breakfast and paying my gas bill. But I could not shake\
  \ the words out of my bonce. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I eventually discovered\
  \ your website and proceeded to read everything you have written over the past nine\
  \ years. Then I read it all again, making annotations in a jotting pad with a propelling\
  \ pencil. I have been amazed to learn so much, so so much!, about those things with\
  \ wings and beaks and feathers and talons flying around in the air, sometimes swooping,\
  \ sometimes gliding, sometimes perched on tree branches or fenceposts, which I now\
  \ realise are birds. For that I am eternally grateful to you, Mr Key, and I just\
  \ wish you would stop wasting your time, and mine, by prattling on about other,\
  \ non-avian, subject matter.\nThat is fairly typical of the sort of letters birdy\
  \ enthusiasts send me, including the reference to dreams of the dwarf Crepusco,\
  \ which turns up with a frequency I am beginning to worry about. In spite of these\
  \ pleas, however, I am not persuaded to ditch all non-avian subject matter from\
  \ the broad magnificent sweep of what we might call Hooting Yard praxis. It is tempting\
  \ to do so, and to become a sort of one stop shop for encyclopaedic ornithological\
  \ wisdom, but it is a temptation I resist.\nClearly, however, in my planned alphabetic\
  \ bestiary, B is for Bird is going to be a very lengthy section, so lengthy that\
  \ it might well unbalance the book. If I worked on the basis of a volume of 260\
  \ pages, it would be sensible, and neat and tidy, to allot ten pages to each beast\
  \ from A to Z. Ten pages might well exhaust my ability to say anything enlightening\
  \ about the anaconda, and indeed the cow, but the bird? The bird? How could I hope\
  \ to cram into a mere ten pages the full fruit of my birdy learning? Even if I used\
  \ so tiny a typeface that you would ruin your eyesight trying to read it, still,\
  \ it is a well nigh impossible task, a fool's errand.\nThis present postage is in\
  \ itself evidence of the difficulties I would face. Having set out to consider the\
  \ anaconda, the bird, and the cow, I find I have babbled on about our feathered\
  \ friends to the point where there is no space left to say anything remotely informative\
  \ about the cow. Perhaps the bestiary is not such a good idea after all. The Hooting\
  \ Yard Book o\u2019 Birds, though, now that is a different matter . . .\n[2012-10-30]"
