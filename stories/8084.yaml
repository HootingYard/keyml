text: "We have learned that the best place in which to store your collection of gulls\u2019\
  \ eggs is a fogou. It is indubitably useful to know that. But what if you have no\
  \ gulls\u2019 eggs to store away? What then?\n\u201COh woe is me! for I have not\
  \ two gulls\u2019 eggs to rub together!\u201D This is the plaintive cry of the otherwise\
  \ happy fellow whose fogou lies empty. It is a cry that, however often heard, never\
  \ fails to tug at the heartstrings, for those whose hearts have tuggable strings,\
  \ which is most of us, or so I like to think, for I believe in the inherent goodness\
  \ of humanity, despite all the evidence to the contrary. And goodness knows there\
  \ is contrary evidence aplenty! I think it was Molesworth 2 who observed \u201C\
  Reality is so unspeakably sordid it make me shudder\u201D, and even I can see the\
  \ truth of that. So perhaps it is fair to say there is a measure of unreality about\
  \ my belief in goodness. Real or unreal, however, I know that when I hear a poor\
  \ benighted soul bewailing his utter lack of gulls\u2019 eggs, I weep. I would like\
  \ to think you would weep too.\nBut what can we do about it? No matter how copious\
  \ and salty our tears, tears alone will not drum up a clutch of gulls\u2019 eggs\
  \ to give to the fellow bereft. Imagine if they did! If, as each tear rolled down\
  \ our cheek, la!, we could pluck from the air a fresh gull's egg and hand it, with\
  \ great care, so as not to crush it, to the tenant of a gulls\u2019 eggless fogou.\
  \ Perhaps that is not so improbable as you may think. Sophocles, for example, believed\
  \ that the tears of the birds known as the Meleagrides solidified into amber. Yes,\
  \ yes, I know it is something of a stretch to conclude from that that the tears\
  \ of good-hearted humans could solidify into gulls\u2019 eggs, but it is at least\
  \ worth holding in our heads for a little while. For were it so we could solve the\
  \ whole problem of the poor fellow and his fogou and his lack of gulls\u2019 eggs.\n\
  You will say that there are more urgent matters to be addressed in this vale of\
  \ tears. War, pestilence, famine, disease, rust, inclement weather\u2026 all these,\
  \ it is true, may place a greater strain on our heartstrings than the man without\
  \ gulls\u2019 eggs ever could. Are we, then, to cast him aside, like so much chaff?\
  \ I have heard it said, by those whom I suspect subscribe to Molesworth 2's tragic\
  \ vision, that the man would be better off filling his fogou with chaff, and have\
  \ done with it. Reluctant as I am to admit as much, there is some merit in this\
  \ view. Chaff is easily gathered. One need not go clambering about on remote coastal\
  \ promontories, at risk of toppling on to the sea-smashed rocks far below, to raid\
  \ the nest of a gull for its complement of eggs. That, quite frankly, is going to\
  \ be how you are going to get hold of some gulls\u2019 eggs, because never in a\
  \ million years, in Molesworth 2's unspeakably sordid reality, will your tears solidify\
  \ in some implausible Sophoclean fashion into gulls\u2019 eggs, much as I might\
  \ wish such a happenstance to occur.\nThere will have to come a point where the\
  \ man ceases his plaintive wailing and settles for a fogou full of chaff rather\
  \ than of gulls\u2019 eggs. But the worst thing we can do is to slap him around\
  \ the head and tell him to pull himself together and to go off chaff-gathering.\
  \ No, we must break it to him gently, solicitously, tenderly. Let him dab at his\
  \ tears with a rag, and lie on a lawn, and perform breathing exercises recommended\
  \ by the most wise gurus from the mystic Orient. Then, when he is becalmed, we can\
  \ begin, slowly, to turn his mind away from gulls\u2019 eggs and towards chaff.\
  \ One way to do this is to plant the idea in his brain that there is no such thing\
  \ as a gull's egg. How might we accomplish this? Well, if I may be permitted to\
  \ interject a personal anecdote here, I think I can point the way towards a successful\
  \ outcome.\nA few years ago, I fell in with a wizardy mindbender type of person,\
  \ who managed to convince me\u2014and I am not making this up\u2014that there was\
  \ no such thing as an egg. Not just a gull's egg, but an egg, plain and simple.\
  \ He did this by cleverly planting in my path, wherever I roamed, wherever I looked,\
  \ at all times of day and night, cartons of the proprietary product known as No\
  \ Egg. Thus assailed by the words at every turn\u2014No Egg! No Egg! No Egg!\u2014\
  within a matter of hours I could no longer even imagine such an object as an egg.\
  \ Thus we can obtain dozens, or hundreds, of cartons of No Egg, and modify them,\
  \ using a magic marker pen or a crayon, to read No Gull's Egg. Scatter them wherever\
  \ the fellow might roam, wherever he might look, at all hours of day and night,\
  \ and he will not long have dried his tears before he can no longer conceive of\
  \ the existence of gulls\u2019 eggs, and he will happily cram his fogou with chaff.\n\
