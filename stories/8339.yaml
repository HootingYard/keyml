text: "It was my intention today to use this space to compile a list of nitwits. The\
  \ idea was to save you, gentle readers, from having to work out for yourselves who\
  \ was, and who was not, a nitwit. You could simply memorise my list and then, whenever\
  \ you saw or heard a nitwit, you could cry \u201CNitwit!\u201D, and pay the nitwit\
  \ in question no further regard, thus freeing up your time for more salubrious pursuits\
  \ than being exposed to nitwittery. If your cranial integuments were unequal to\
  \ the task of memorising the list, you could print it out and carry it with you\
  \ at all times, in pocket or reticule, hoisting it out to check it when in the presence\
  \ of a possible or probable nitwit.\nI am not suggesting that you do not know a\
  \ nitwit when you see one, but I thought it would be helpful for you to have a ready\
  \ made list. Ah, but already your eyes are scanning the splurge of text below this\
  \ line, and you see no sign of a list. Did my plan gang agley, and if so, why, for\
  \ heaven's sake?\nWell, jumping out of bed before dawn and plunging my head into\
  \ a pail of ice-cold water, as ever, I began compiling the list within that same\
  \ head, wet and freezing. There would be time enough to write down the names of\
  \ this first flurry of nitwits when I repaired to my escritoire after breakfast,\
  \ breakfast today being eggy, accompanied by a single smokers\u2019 poptart, washed\
  \ down with liquefied vitamin-enriched pap. The difference between common or garden\
  \ pap and liquefied pap is that the latter is runnier, and can be poured into a\
  \ beaker for the swigging therefrom. Common or garden pap, while still runny, when\
  \ compared say to a potato or a block of suet, is usually served in a bowl and eaten\
  \ with a spoon. I know these things.\nBut I am leaping ahead of myself. Let us return\
  \ to where I was doubled over with my head plunged into a pail of icy water. The\
  \ names of seven or eight nitwits sprang to mind before I lifted my head, took a\
  \ gulp of air, and replunged. During the second immersion I thought of several more\
  \ nitwits. One more deep breath, and the third and final plunge, and before I was\
  \ even wrapping a towel around my freezing head I had a mental list of at least\
  \ a score of nitwits.\nI just need to clear something up here before we proceed.\
  \ I may have given the impression that I am only capable of thinking of the names\
  \ of nitwits at such times as my head is immersed in ice cold water. Not so! I can\
  \ as well summon the names of a legion of nitwits with my head wrapped in a towel,\
  \ or indeed not wrapped in a towel or any other swaddling, just plonked atop my\
  \ neck breathing in the air, fresh or foetid as may be. Don't get the wrong idea.\n\
  So, as I prepared my breakfast eggs \u2018n\u2019 smokers\u2019 poptart \u2018n\u2019\
  \ pap, with my habitual ritualistic precision, I congratulated myself on having\
  \ made a splendid start to my nitwit list. And here I must confess that self-congratulation\
  \ is my fatal weakness. I have been known to give myself a thunderous round of applause\
  \ simply for completing a mundane task, for instance making my breakfast, or tying\
  \ my bootlaces. In my defence, I would point out that I only do this because it\
  \ was recommended to me by the author of the only self-help book I have ever read.\
  \ In Clap Yourself Stupid!\u2014Ten Steps To A Dementedly High Level Of Self-Esteem,\
  \ Dr Bruce Terrific\u2014pictured on the back cover wearing splendid moustachios\
  \ and a cravat\u2014suggests not only applauding oneself but also patting oneself\
  \ on the back using a patented arm-extension device, striking one's own medals from\
  \ milk-bottle caps, and playing tape recordings of the cheering of hysterically\
  \ overexcited crowds, cleverly modified so they sound as if they are bawling one's\
  \ own name through tears of happiness and joy. I have found these methods work wonders,\
  \ and it is now at least three weeks since I have compared myself to a worm wriggling\
  \ in the muck.\nMore names of nitwits popped into my head, now dry and slightly\
  \ warmer, as I ate my breakfast. I was impatient to get to the escritoire and to\
  \ start writing them down. At this point, I began to wonder whether I ought to simply\
  \ scribble the names down, one after another, on sheets of notepaper, or if it would\
  \ be better to make use of a stack of index cards. If I gave each nitwit their own\
  \ individual card, I would have space for annotations. These could prove invaluable.\
  \ Already, in my mental list of nitwits, I had two nitwits with very similar names,\
  \ differing in fact by only a single letter. Granted, they were both nitwits, through\
  \ and through, but the nature of their nitwittery varied\u2014one was a saintly\
  \ nitwit, the other a knave and jackass\u2014and it would not do to mix them up.\
  \ It also occurred to me that, as my list lengthened, there may be a similar similarity\
  \ in the name of a nitwit and the name of one who was not a nitwit by any stretch\
  \ of the imagination. I did not want the users of my list to call its reliability\
  \ into question by making the assumption that I had included a non-nitwit on a list\
  \ of nitwits or, worse, that I had declared one who was quite clearly not a nitwit\
  \ to be a nitwit. Were that to happen, I would run the risk of being called a nitwit\
  \ myself. Perish the thought!\nIf only the thought had perished. But it began to\
  \ gnaw at me, before I had even finished my breakfast, before I had even got as\
  \ far as my escritoire, and my notepad, and my stack of index cards, and my pot\
  \ of propelling pencils. Should I be on the nitwit list?, I asked myself, over and\
  \ over again. Sometimes I answered no, sometimes yes, sometimes I left the question\
  \ hanging, and it hung over me like the sword of Damocles, to the point where I\
  \ got all wibblywobbly and frightened and jellylegged and fretful. Hoping for some\
  \ kind of succour, I reached for my self-help book and stared at the photograph\
  \ of Dr Bruce Terrific. His black and white eyes gazed back at me, curiously unreadable,\
  \ fathomless, cold. It was like looking into the unreadable fathomless cold eyes\
  \ of a swan.\nI received no succour, no answer. Mopping up the last bit of egg with\
  \ the last corner of smokers\u2019 poptart, I decided I could not take the risk\
  \ of being dubbed a nitwit. If I were called a nitwit, I might become a nitwit,\
  \ my name at the top of my own list of the names of nitwits. It was a prospect too\
  \ horrible to contemplate. I banged my fork on my plate and stood up, and I walked\
  \ right past my escritoire, out through the door, into the freezing cold, and I\
  \ gulped the icy air, as dawn came crashing across the sky.\n[2012-02-10]"
