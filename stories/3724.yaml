text: "I was startled, to say the least, when I read that, some years ago, the Prime\
  \ Minister of Japan was attacked and almost slain by a deranged killer robot. Imagine\
  \ the kerfuffle if such a thing had happened to one of our own past Prime Ministers,\
  \ Harold Macmillan, say, or Neville Chamberlain. (It was Lloyd George who remarked\
  \ that Chamberlain had \u201Ca wrong-shaped head\u201D. Lord knows what he would\
  \ have made of the bonce of a killer robot.)\nAlas, it appears from the video kindly\
  \ posted by Mr Eugenides that the PM-robot encounter was not quite as blood-curdling\
  \ as we are led to believe. This just goes to show that you simply cannot trust\
  \ most of what you read, either in newspapers or on the interweb. One shining exception,\
  \ of course, is Hooting Yard. I am regularly discomfited when it is suggested that\
  \ I make a lot of this stuff up, whereas I spend untold hours engaged in rigorous,\
  \ yes, damned rigorous research to bring you the nuggets of wisdom contained herein.\
  \ Only yesterday, after\_To Vange! was posted here, \_I had to put up with mutterings\
  \ about the allegedly fictional nature of Vange Well No. 5, for goodness\u2019 sake!\
  \ Get a grip, readers. You will certainly never find me babbling on about killer\
  \ robots attacking veteran politicians. Cows attacking Blunkett, yes. There is a\
  \ difference.\n[2010-01-22]"
