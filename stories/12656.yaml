text: "\nOne of the \u201Cvulgar errors\u201D addressed by Sir Thomas Browne in his\
  \ Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646) was the belief that the legs of the badger are longer\
  \ on the right side than on the left. This was generally accepted, and stated in\
  \ many early books of natural history with considerable authority. Browne argued\
  \ that the theory was completely absurd, deprecating Albertus Magnus, calling Aldrovandi\
  \ in his support, and noting that Aristotle had said an odd leg was repugnant to\
  \ the course of nature. He considered the cases of spiders, frogs, and lobsters\
  \ in making the case for badgers having legs of equal length.\nEdmund Gosse was\
  \ a great admirer of Browne and wrote a monograph on him for Macmillan's English\
  \ Men of Letters series in 1905. Browne on badgers provoked Gosse to a rare fit\
  \ of exasperation:\nMeanwhile, we cannot help asking ourselves why the learned sceptic\
  \ did not immediately get hold of a real badger, and measure his legs. He says that\
  \ \u201Cupon indifferent inquiry, I cannot discover this difference\u201D in the\
  \ length of them ; but why did he not make sure for himself? It is true that badgers\
  \ are extremely shy and mysterious in their movements, and that, no doubt, it was\
  \ not every sportsman in the neighbourhood of Norwich who could boast of having\
  \ dug one out of its earth. It is perhaps to ask too much for us to wish that, in\
  \ the zeal of his zoology, Thomas Browne himself, with a sack and a pair of badger-tongs,\
  \ and accompanied by some trusty yokels and a cross-bred bull terrier used to the\
  \ business, should have worried the bowels of earth in some copse on a starlight\
  \ night, and have procured a badger for himself. But, surely, an observer so curious\
  \ might have bargained with some farmer who lived out Catton way, or close to a\
  \ snug rabbit-warren under Earlham, for a specimen of so common an animal, He comes\
  \ to the correct conclusion, that the monstrosity is ill-contrived, \u201Cthe shortness\
  \ being affixed unto the legs of one side, which might have been more tolerably\
  \ placed upon the thwart or diagonal movers\u201D. Quite so ; but how briefly the\
  \ question might have been settled once for all with a tape measure on the dead\
  \ body of a badger.\n[2014-04-13]"
