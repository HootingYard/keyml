text: "I ought to have explained that the piece entitled The Cruel Sea was simply\
  \ a list of titles of the books currently being written by bestselling paperbackist\
  \ Pebblehead. He always has a number of works on the go at any one time, expertly\
  \ juggling everything in that big baked potato-like head of his. Hooting Yard reader\
  \ Dr Ruth Pastry tells me that she is drawing a diagram of Pebblehead's head, or\
  \ more precisely of the innards of his head, which she wants me to post here when\
  \ it is finished. That means we will all have a better, and long overdue, insight\
  \ into the great paperbackist's fantastic brain, in diagrammatic form, with arrows.\n\
  NOTE\_: Dr Pastry says her diagram will be without arrows.\n[2009-01-28]"
