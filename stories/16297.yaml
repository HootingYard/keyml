text: "Today the chief engineers have been down to our part of the mine. They descended\
  \ in the rickety lift of the Sylvia Townsend Warner Memorial Shaft, and stood in\
  \ a huddle, puffing on their pipes and blowing smoke at the canaries. Whether this\
  \ was vindictive or in the interests of scientific research was not clear. There\
  \ were seven of them, like Snow White's seven mining dwarves, and they were similarly\
  \ mononymous. The chief engineers were known as Wretched, Spiteful, Incontinent,\
  \ Peevish, Lippy, Rancorous, and Preening.\nOne might assume these names to reflect\
  \ their personalities, but that was not the case. If we consult their academic reports\
  \ from the Valentine Ackland Memorial College of Mining, Boring, & Pitcraft, we\
  \ learn that Wretched was judged to be preening and rancorous, Spiteful to be lippy\
  \ and peevish, Incontinent to be spiteful and wretched, Peevish to be rancorous\
  \ and incontinent, Lippy to be preening and spiteful, Rancorous to be peevish and\
  \ lippy, and Preening to be illegible. Not one of them was a dwarf, or even a gnome.\n\
  They stood puffing in silence for a while, until one of them spoke.\n\u201CIt strikes\
  \ me that this mine is rather Kafkaesque,\u201D said Lippy.\n\u201COh? In what sense?\u201D\
  \ the other six said, or rather sang, in harmony, to the tune of Land Of Ladies\
  \ by the Brothers Johnson.\n\u201CPerhaps it would be more accurate to say that\
  \ the management of the mine is Kafkaesque,\u201D said Lippy, \u201CIn that it is\
  \ a labyrinthine, senseless, and oppressive bureaucracy. Consider that there are\
  \ seven of us chief engineers, yet only three miners.\u201D\nHe was referring to\
  \ me and my two colleagues, who had taken a break from toil in order to meet with\
  \ the chief engineers. Lippy called us miners, but we prefer to think of ourselves\
  \ as troglodytes. None of us had been up to the surface since the dying days of\
  \ the Nixon administration.\nWe had been transfixed by the Watergate hearings. Shortly\
  \ before going down the mine we compiled a Who's Who of the scandal, in which the\
  \ three of us drew sharp, pointed pen-portraits of the significant players, including\
  \ Nixon himself and Ronald Ziegler and Ken Clawson and H R Haldeman and Donald Segretti\
  \ and Dwight Lee Chapin and John Dean and John & Martha Mitchell and Bruce Kehrli\
  \ and Gordon C Strachan and Herbert Warren Kalmbach and Chuck Colson and Gerry &\
  \ The Pacemakers and Robert C Mardian and Jeb Magruder and Maurice Stans and G Gordon\
  \ Liddy (not Lippy) and Hugh Sloan and James McCord and John Erlichman and David\
  \ Young and Egil Krogh and E Howard Hunt and Richard Kleindienst and Richard Helms\
  \ and Patrick Gray and Vernon Walters. We thought it judicious to omit our own names,\
  \ and, to be on the safe side, volunteered for duty in the salt mine until the whole\
  \ sorry business had blown over.\nNow, faced with seven chief engineers, we would\
  \ have to dissemble.\n\u201CWell, O weird hunched albino men of the pit,\u201D said\
  \ Lippy, addressing us directly for the first time, \u201CWe have come down into\
  \ the Stygian gloom to find out how much salt you've mined. I must say the production\
  \ figures are disappointing.\u201D\n\u201CI can assure you we have been tireless\
  \ in our search for salt down here,\u201D I lied, \u201CAnd in fact we think we\
  \ spotted a tad just before you and your fellow chief engineers arrived.\u201D\n\
  \u201CExcellent,\u201D said Lippy, \u201CThen perhaps we should leave you free to\
  \ mine it.\u201D\n\u201CThere is nothing we would enjoy more,\u201D I lied again,\
  \ \u201CBut before we do so, would it not be wise for the seven of you to check\
  \ that what we found actually is salt, and not some other mineral with properties\
  \ closely resembling but not identical to salt?\u201D\nLippy went back into a huddle\
  \ with Wretched and Spiteful and Incontinent and Peevish and Rancorous and Preening\
  \ to discuss this.\nI was lying because we had not actually been looking for salt\
  \ at all, nor had we found any, not even a tad. Instead, we had been opening up\
  \ a cavern, and creating a huge underground aviary in which we were breeding an\
  \ entirely new type of hyperintelligent subterranean canary. This represented a\
  \ great advance on what we had been up to in the Watergate building on that night\
  \ in June 1972. But we could not\u2014yet\u2014reveal our doings to Lippy and his\
  \ fellows.\nThey finished talking, and Lippy turned to me.\n\u201CVery well,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CWhere are we to find this tad of what may be salt?\u201D\nI pointed\
  \ at the entrance to an excessively long, dark, winding, horrible tunnel.\n\u201C\
  Go down there,\u201D I said, \u201CAnd mind your step. It is long and dark and winding\
  \ and horrible.\u201D\nAnd so, ten minutes ago, the naive, if not outright idiotic,\
  \ chief engineers went pootling off down a tunnel so long and dark and winding and\
  \ horrible that it is likely to drive them insane. They will find no salt, and they\
  \ may be attacked by a few stray hyperintelligent subterranean canaries, but we\
  \ don't care. Besides, our shift will soon come to an end; we shall not be here\
  \ to see them coming back.\nThe first sentence, and the last, were translated from\
  \ the German by Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.\n[2018-02-27]"
