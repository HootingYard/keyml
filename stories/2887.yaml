text: "Things are going from bad to worse with Dennis Beerpint. The weedy poet, still\
  \ posing as a beatnik, was apparently very upset by the negative reviews of his\
  \ newly-published Ginsbergy Howl-y piece, Whimper!, a thousand-odd lines of unrelieved\
  \ drivel. At public performances, where he has been declaiming these free verse\
  \ witterings from platforms and soap-boxes, hecklers boo and things get chucked\
  \ at him, chiefly tomatoes.\nNow, Beerpint has fallen victim to delusions of persecution.\
  \ In a letter to the weekly magazine Weedy Poets Under Attack, he claims that this\
  \ passage from The Anatomie Of Absvrditie by Thomas Nashe, written over four hundred\
  \ years ago, is aimed directly at him:\n\u201CHence come our babling Ballets, and\
  \ our new found Songs and Sonets, which euery rednose Fidler hath at his fingers\
  \ end, and euery ignorant Ale knight will breath foorth ouer the potte, as soone\
  \ as his braine waxeth hote. Be it a truth which they would tune, they enterlace\
  \ it with a lye or two to make meeter, not regarding veritie, so they may make vppe\
  \ the verse ; not vnlike to Homer, who cared not what he fained, so hee might make\
  \ his Countrimen famous. But as the straightest things beeing put into water, seeme\
  \ crooked, so the crediblest trothes, if once they come with in compasse of these\
  \ mens wits, seeme tales. Were it that the infamie of their ignoraunce did redound\
  \ onelie vppon themselues, I could be content to apply my speech otherwise, then\
  \ to their Apuleyan eares, but sith they obtaine the name of our English Poets,\
  \ and thereby make men thinke more baselie of the wittes of our Countrey, I cannot\
  \ but turne them out of their counterfeit luerie, and brand them in the foreheade,\
  \ that all men may know their falshood\u2026 What politique Counsailour or valiant\
  \ Souldier will ioy or glorie of this, in that some stitcher, Weauer, spendthrift,\
  \ or Fidler, hath shuffled or slubberd vp a few ragged Rimes, in the memoriall of\
  \ the ones prudence, or the others prowesse? It makes the learned sort to be silent,\
  \ when as they see vnlearned sots so insolent.\u201D\nIs Beerpint an insolent unlearned\
  \ sot? Perhaps he is. On the other hand, if this passage really is directed at him,\
  \ it is likely to be the one and only time he is compared to Homer.\nBut now my\
  \ own braine waxeth hote, for the sun is bright and battering, and I must lie me\
  \ down in the shade, and ponder the wonders of Burnham-on-Crouch, of which more\
  \ some other time.\n[2009-08-17]"
