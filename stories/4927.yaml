text: "I was striding manfully across Sawdust Bridge, on my way to see a man about\
  \ some snails, when I was accosted and harangued by a gobby git. His speech, if\
  \ one can call it that, was indecorous and unseemly, and his head was somewhat larger\
  \ than the usual head. I wondered if, in his infancy, his fontanelle had sealed\
  \ properly, or if it remained ajar, as it were, allowing a surfeit of oxygen into\
  \ his cranium. Were that the case, it might, just might, account for his loud haranguing.\
  \ For loud it was, drawing the attention of other citizens passing along the bridge,\
  \ each of whom gazed at him, and at me, before hurrying along bent upon whatever\
  \ errands they were bent upon, that morning.\nI found it very difficult to judge\
  \ whether his torso was clothed in a pullover or a cardigan. The garment seemed\
  \ to resist definition. It was certainly not a sweater nor a jumper, nor could it\
  \ be called a \u201Ctop\u201D, but I could not pinpoint exactly what it was. Such\
  \ was the nature of his harangue that it was impossible to interrupt him, so I had\
  \ no opportunity to question him on the matter. The presence of buttons argued for\
  \ a cardigan, yet it was not quite a cardigan, having a definite something of the\
  \ pullover about it. It began to rain.\nAtop the git's unusually large head perched\
  \ a yellow oilcloth sou'wester, suggesting to me that he was not neglectful of meteorological\
  \ conditions. Given the size of his head, the sou'wester, which would have served\
  \ as adequate cover for most heads, looked comically tiny. It occurred to me that\
  \ he might wear it in rain or shine, as protection for his unsealed fontanelle,\
  \ and that its keeping the rainfall off the top of his head was secondary, a sort\
  \ of bonus. Meanwhile, with a certain brio, I unfurled my brolly. I held it aloft\
  \ as if I were Liberty brandishing her flambeau, though necessarily at an angle\
  \ better poised to bar raindrops from falling on my head.\nAnd just as my brolly\
  \ barred the raindrops, so the gobby git barred my progress further along Sawdust\
  \ Bridge towards my appointment with the snails chap. As he delivered his loud and\
  \ unseemly stream of invective, he constantly shifted his position so that he was\
  \ always standing directly in front of me, as I feinted this way and that in my\
  \ attempts to go where I wanted to go. I ought to have lashed out at him with my\
  \ brolly, but long, long ago I made a vow. Well, if I am honest, I was forced to\
  \ make a vow, on pain of eternal punishment in the hereafter, and with the added\
  \ spur of the threat of having my fontanelle pierced and punctured in the here and\
  \ now. The important thing, for present purposes, was that the vow had been made,\
  \ and I held to it.\nRaindrops were falling at a slight angle upon the buttons of\
  \ the gobby git's cardigan or pullover, and thence dripping to his feet which, I\
  \ noted, were shod in the sock-and-sandal combination associated with a certain\
  \ stereotype. He did not seem at all that type, to me, there on Sawdust Bridge in\
  \ the morning rain, delivering his loud harangue and accompanying it now with wild\
  \ gesticulations. I did not feel menaced by these gesticulations, for at no point\
  \ did his arms move towards my head or my body. They were, rather, like the movements\
  \ of the sails of a windmill, or of a swimming person doing the butterfly stroke.\
  \ They seemed curiously disconnected from his harangue, neither emphasising points\
  \ within his indecorous guttural bawling, if indeed there were any, nor accompanying\
  \ it in any way. Also, he was wearing mittens.\nThere was a spattering of yellow\
  \ stains upon the mittens, an identical shade to the patches of yellow on his moustache,\
  \ which was of the walrus variety. I jumped to the conclusion that it was either\
  \ mustard or custard, perhaps from the eating of a hot dog or a custard tart. I\
  \ was unable to discern any crumbs, the composition of which, of bread or pastry,\
  \ would have confirmed which of my suspicions was the correct one, although of course\
  \ it was possible that the stains were neither mustard nor custard but another yellow\
  \ substance entirely. Again, so unstoppable was the gobby git's harangue that I\
  \ was unable to question him on the point.\nWhen, long ago, I made, or was forced\
  \ to make, my vow, I was vouchsafed a few tips about what I could do, in circumstances\
  \ where I might wish to lash out with my brolly, instead of lashing out with my\
  \ brolly, but with similar effect. One is rarely vouchsafed anything at all nowadays,\
  \ but as I said, it was long, long ago. As I peered at the gobby git's rather gauche\
  \ cheesecloth trousers\u2014or were they pantaloons?\u2014one of these tips bubbled\
  \ up from the sea of memory and bobbed to the surface. \u201CTilt your head heavenward,\u201D\
  \ I recalled being told, \u201CAnd call out, lustily, and high in pitch, for all\
  \ the angels in heaven to beclabber together and send down to you a deus ex machina!\u201D\
  \nNow I have never knowingly seen an angel, and instinctively I feel such a creature\
  \ cannot really exist, but the gobby git was getting on my wick by this time, and\
  \ so I followed the old advice I had been vouchsafed. Of course, when I tilted my\
  \ head heavenward all I saw was the dry underside of my brolly, so I shifted it\
  \ to one side, again with I hope no little brio, and, though raindrops immediately\
  \ splashed upon my face, I sang out, imploring the aid of quite probably fictional\
  \ unearthly wing\xE9d beings. And do you know, all at once there was a mighty gust\
  \ of wind across the bridge, and the sou'wester atop the gobby git's head was blown\
  \ clear away, it skimmed and swooped across the sky like a bright yellow bird, and\
  \ a raindrop, perhaps more than one, raindrops plural, fell directly through his\
  \ unsealed fontanelle and landed splish splosh upon his exposed brain, and he crumpled\
  \ to the ground and\u2014oh, at last, at last\u2014he ceased haranguing me, for\
  \ he neither spoke now nor croaked. He was silent.\nI left him where he lay, sprawled\
  \ upon the paving slabs, whether dead or alive I did not know, and I hurried onward\
  \ to meet my appointment with the snails man. We transacted useful business, repaired\
  \ to a canteen for luncheon, parted with a handshake in the shade of a gigantic\
  \ shrub in the botanical gardens, and I made my way home. Crossing Sawdust Bridge,\
  \ I saw no sign of the gobby git who had harangued me, and I learned later, listening\
  \ to a local news bulletin on the wireless, that he had died, upon the bridge, that\
  \ morning, of water on the brain.\nI attended his funeral later that week, and placed\
  \ a bunch of dandelions in the graveside mud. It was still raining.\n[2010-08-03]"
