text: "Along with Blenkinsop and De Groot, Pabstus was the man who brought rigour\
  \ to the study of animals\u2019 bones back in the fifties. I wondered what he was\
  \ doing wandering disconsolately around the garden of a Bewilderment Home, for that\
  \ is where I assumed I had been plunked. Before I had a chance to ask him, he began\
  \ to jabber questions at me about the horrible cave. After fifteen or so queries,\
  \ all of which I answered as best as I could, Pabstus changed tack and asked me\
  \ why I was dressed as a giant bee. For my part, let me say it had not escaped my\
  \ notice that the world-famous irredentist was clad in raiment of the utmost gorgeousness.\n\
  We seemed to have struck an instant rapport, so we strolled off together towards\
  \ a nearby pie shop which, Pabstus informed me, he had eaten at every single day\
  \ for the last thirty years. When we entered the place, I pondered his judgment,\
  \ for the floor was alive with scurrying beetles, huge black terrible things, and\
  \ the air was thick with the smell of hamster. Seeing me about to swoon, Pabstus\
  \ grinned, and I saw that his mouth was packed with fangs. There seemed to be too\
  \ many of them to fit, but my eyes did not deceive me.\n\u201CYou have an alarming\
  \ number of teeth, Pabstus,\u201D I observed.\n\u201CNo more than any other member\
  \ of my extended family,\u201D he replied, tapping a bell upon the counter to summon\
  \ the pie shop person. I have had a long and full life, but never before had I heard\
  \ so dreadful a sound as that bell. I clapped my hands over my ears and began to\
  \ weep like an oversensitive orphan child. Pabstus saw my discomfort and bared his\
  \ fangs at me again. The hideous Beelzebubesque bell-pealing faded, but only once\
  \ the sound had died completely did the proprietor appear. I had expected some sort\
  \ of jolly figure like Mister Dough The Baker from a deck of Happy Families playing\
  \ cards, but the pie shop person looked and acted more like a fop of the Regency\
  \ period. He even wore gloves scented with lavender. With a rakish twinkle in his\
  \ eye, he greeted us, and somehow made the words \u201CGood afternoon, would you\
  \ like to buy some pies?\u201D sound lascivious.\n\u201CYes we would!\u201D shouted\
  \ Pabstus at top volume, \u201CFor myself, I want to buy one of your big crinkle-pastry\
  \ dumpling and endive and chicory pies, and two small mustard balls. My colleague\
  \ here will have\u2026\u201D and he trailed off, inviting me to complete our request.\
  \ Not having been to this pie shop before, I had no idea what I should choose, and\
  \ there seemed to be no menu visible. But I sensed inexplicable danger, and wanted\
  \ to get out of here as soon as I could.\u201CI'll have the same,\u201D I announced,\
  \ weakly.\n\u201CThat won't be possible I'm afraid,\u201D said the pie-fop, \u201C\
  As you must surely know, today is Saint Eustace's Day.\u201D\nI did not have the\
  \ energy to argue. Perhaps that blow on the head which found me slumped in an unfamiliar\
  \ armchair and suffering from amnesia had taken more of a toll than I thought. I\
  \ pointed to two celery pies on a shelf behind the counter and asked for them. The\
  \ proprietor preened his locks with macassar oil, and said, \u201CThose pies are\
  \ for rental only.\u201D\nBeetles were now climbing up the legs of my borrowed bee-like\
  \ boiler suit. I could stand no more of this. I turned and left the pie shop, slamming\
  \ the door behind me. I decided that I would rather go hungry than allow myself\
  \ to fall under Pabstus\u2019 spell. It was a decision I would learn to regret.\n\
  Assuming the limping irredentist would pursue me as soon as he had got his hands\
  \ on his pies, I flung myself into a ditch and covered myself with a flag that happened\
  \ to be lying about. I was surprised that the flag had been abandoned, for it looked\
  \ as if it had been stitched only recently, and there was still a needle attached\
  \ to a dangling piece of thread. I accidentally prodded myself with the needle,\
  \ in the general area of my right collarbone, and had to stifle a yelp in case Pabstus\
  \ was already on my trail.\nCrouched under a flag in a ditch in the early afternoon,\
  \ I turned my thoughts once more to the horrible cave, and to the crows that nested\
  \ therein. It was a long, long time since I had been perturbed by birds, so long\
  \ ago that I had difficulty remembering much about the days when my parents\u2019\
  \ toffee shop had been attacked by flocks of mutant sparrows and wagtails. But the\
  \ malevolence of the crows I had seen near the horrible cave was unprecedented.\
  \ Tippi Hedren had an easy time of it by comparison, I reflected ruefully, for I\
  \ am given to rueful reflection, especially when I can feel silage seeping into\
  \ my boots, as I could now. Could I risk standing up? I knew that if I maintained\
  \ my crouch for much longer I would suffer from agonising cramps, and I had left\
  \ my cramp medication in the breast pocket of my pyjama jacket, back at the nursing\
  \ home or whatever it was. I wondered if I could flee from the ditch and make it\
  \ to the building without being waylaid by Pabstus. All of a sudden that stuffy\
  \ lounge with its creaking armchair, and Primrose the nurse with her mashed potatoes,\
  \ even the rake-thin ghoul, seemed more attractive than this stinking ditch.\nCrawling\
  \ out from under the flag, I peered over the lip of the ditch to check that Pabstus\
  \ was no longer in the vicinity. He was not. Perhaps he had taken his pies and was\
  \ sitting on a park bench, masticating them with those fangs of his, swallowing\
  \ every last crumb. I clambered up and was about to stalk off towards the mercy\
  \ home when I thought the flag might come in handy, so I stooped to pick it out\
  \ of the ditch. It was heavier than I thought, but eventually I had it wrapped around\
  \ me. As I turned to go, I saw that now my way was blocked by thousands of cows,\
  \ all of them gazing at me intently, as if I were something they might want to chew\
  \ up and digest. Were they cows, or were they super-intelligent beings from a planet\
  \ in a distant galaxy who looked like earth-cows? Within the next few minutes, I\
  \ would learn the truth, a truth far more incredible than my puny brain could comprehend.\n\
