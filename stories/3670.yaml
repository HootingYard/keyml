text: "When asked how her children address her, the novelist A S Byatt replied \u201C\
  They call me A S Byatt\u201D. This seems to me to be parenting of a decisively brilliant\
  \ kind. It is rather late in the day, but I will demand that the not-so-tiny Key\
  \ nippers call me \u201CMr Key\u201D.\nMeanwhile, if ever I bump into A S Byatt\u2014\
  and I well might, in the bookish labyrinth of the London Library\u2014I am going\
  \ to call her \u201CMum\u201D.\n[2010-01-13]"
