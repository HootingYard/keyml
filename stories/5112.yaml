text: "Forgive me a spot of navel-gazing, but I wanted to make a few remarks that\
  \ occurred to me while tippy-tapping out the lecture from long ago, almost a quarter\
  \ of a century old.\nAs I indicated, it was a whim to post it. I remain fond of\
  \ it, and it seemed worth resurrecting. I was determined to tap it out word for\
  \ word, resisting the temptation to make any changes\u2014which led me to wince,\
  \ like the narrator, more than once. As with much, possibly all, of my pre-Wilderness\
  \ Years scribbling, it contains a number of infelicities I would (hope to) avoid\
  \ today.\nWhat interested me were the three passages in quotations, the two statements\
  \ by the judge and the letter from Flubb. The first two are exercises in methods\
  \ I have not used in a long time (but which I enjoyed revisiting), the third is\u2026\
  \ I am not quite sure.\nThe judge's summing-up in Curpin's case is an example of\
  \ my once much-practised version of Burroughs\u2019 cut-up technique. No physical\
  \ cutting was required. I used to buy a preposterous number of secondhand copies\
  \ of National Geographic magazine, from the 1950s and early 1960s. (Around 1964\
  \ there was a change in their colour reproduction, and thereafter the photographs\
  \ lacked the bright gaudy glory of the golden age.) The method, such as it was,\
  \ involved casting my eyes over the text, more casually than skim-reading, until\
  \ a phrase nabbed my attention, at which point I'd write it down and resume, looking\
  \ for the next phrase, usually on a different page or a different copy of the magazine.\
  \ Vast paragraphs of incoherent twaddle can be generated this way, my only contribution\
  \ being a few tweaks here and there to make the prose flow grammatically.\nThe list\
  \ of Flubb's crimes is of course alphabetic. There was a time when I found this\
  \ method indispensable, either for single paragraphs (as in the lecture) or to structure\
  \ longer pieces, like The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet. I played around with variations,\
  \ such as pairing letters in combinations or substituting alphabetic order with\
  \ qwerty keyboard order. All very Oulipian.\nAs far as I can ascertain, what I think\
  \ I was up to in the third bit, the letter from Flubb, was striving, tentatively,\
  \ for my own style, my own voice. And it seems to me now that those two methods,\
  \ the one pretty random, the other constraining, were decisive steps, that I wouldn't\
  \ write the way I do if I hadn't relied on them for a while. (I also had a bash\
  \ at surrealist \u201Cautomatic\u201D writing. The less said about that the better.)\n\
  End of solipsistic babbling. Normal service will be resumed.\n[2010-08-25]"
