text: 'John Fernely, a successful Victorian dauber who lived in Melton Mowbray, charged
  ten pounds to paint a portrait of a horse, but only seven pounds for a portrait
  of a cow. Were these costs fair? Would you have been prepared to pay more for a
  cow picture than a horse painting? If not, why not? What do you think was going
  on in Fernely''s head when he set these prices? Comments please.
