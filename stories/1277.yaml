  Frank Key's Squirrel Count\u2122. I can think of nothing that would excite readers\
  \ quite as much as learning how many squirrels I have seen each day. So, to the\
  \ sound of tooting horns and shrill whistle-blasts, with flags and banners flying,\
  \ and perhaps some clowns cavorting upon a specially-built platform, here is the\
  \ very first bulletin from Frank Key's Squirrel Count\u2122 2009.\n01.01.09 Six\
  \ squirrels, or possibly three squirrels each seen twice.\n\n[2009-01-01]"
