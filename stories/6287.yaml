text: "I should perhaps give some explanation of the postages headed The Funnel, Volumes\
  \ One and Two. They comprise the lists of contents of the only two editions of a\
  \ decisively obscure magazine entitled The Funnel, conceived and written by Dobson\
  \ and edited and published by Marigold Chew.\nDobson was insanely jealous of the\
  \ success of the Reader's Digest, every single issue of which sold more copies than\
  \ even his most popular pamphlets. Trudging along one morning past the pollarded\
  \ willows by the canal just before the level crossing, it occurred to him that whereas\
  \ his pamphlets tended, in the main, to address one subject at a time, the great\
  \ attraction of the Reader's Digest was its variety. Each copy came packed with\
  \ diverting disquisitions on topics as various as John's kidney, escapes from imperilment,\
  \ Jane's liver, Aztec antiquities, anticommunist hysteria, and astrological flummery.\n\
  \u201CTo hell with pamphlets!\u201D shouted the pamphleteer, at a siskin perched\
  \ upon a bough. The siskin is, in the words of one ornithologist, an attractive\
  \ little finch, but it has no understanding of human speech, so Dobson's words were\
  \ wasted. But when he arrived home, having plodded around the edge of the eerie\
  \ marsh, he repeated his imprecation to Marigold Chew.\n\u201CGosh,\u201D she said,\
  \ adding \u201CYou could just staple four or five pamphlets together, and that would\
  \ provide the variety you seek, Dobson.\u201D\n\u201CHave you actually seen the\
  \ Reader's Digest?\u201D shouted Dobson, \u201CIt covers far more than four or five\
  \ topics. It is so packed with prose that its binding needs a spine, unlike virtually\
  \ ever other magazine available at this point in the twentieth century!\u201D\n\u201C\
  So staple ten or a dozen pamphlets together, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew.\n\
  \u201CNo staple is big or sturdy enough for the popular magazine I envisage!\u201D\
  \ shouted Dobson, and he began pouring milk into a bowl.\nOver the following weeks\
  \ and months, the pamphleteer and his inamorata thrashed out the details of a publication\
  \ Dobson was convinced would have the editor of the Reader's Digest either grovelling\
  \ piteously at his feet or banging his head repeatedly against the damp stone walls\
  \ of an oubliette in a secure facility for lunatics. Each issue of the as yet untitled\
  \ magazine would contain not ten, not a dozen, but thirteen articles, penned by\
  \ Dobson but with titles provided by Marigold Chew. She would enter into a shamanistic\
  \ trance-frenzy, cavorting dizzily around a bonfire in the back garden, twigs and\
  \ bones and feathers entwined in her hair, and summon from eldritch tonybuzanities\
  \ a set of two-word titles based on the alphabet (issue one) or the qwerty keyboard\
  \ layout (issue two). Fuelled by plentiful tumblers of aerated radishwater, Dobson\
  \ would write all the articles in one marathon scribbleathon, the reams and reams\
  \ of dazzling prose typeset and Gestetnered by Marigold Chew, and untold millions\
  \ of copies piled high in a convoy of container lorries revving their diesel motors\
  \ outside the house, ready to fan out across the land to doctors\u2019 and dentists\u2019\
  \ waiting rooms and other carefully selected distribution points.\nOn a Thursday\
  \ night in November, Marigold Chew induced a shamanistic trance-frenzy and delivered\
  \ forth twenty-six titles for Dobson to crack on with. At dawn, brandishing the\
  \ flayed skin of a wolf on which the titles were daubed in her own blood, she went\
  \ looking for the pamphleteer, who was nowhere to be found in the house. She found\
  \ him beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing,\
  \ slumped in the muck, weeping.\n\u201CHere, Dobson,\u201D she cried, still in a\
  \ partial frenzy, \u201CThe contents of issues one and two of The Funnel are ready\
  \ for you, wrenched from realms beyond sense!\u201D\nBut Dobson continued to weep,\
  \ clawing at the mud.\n\u201CAll is hopeless, hopeless,\u201D he whimpered, \u201C\
  I have just been apprised, by Sputnik or some such space age contraption, of the\
  \ latest Reader's Digest circulation figures. I must be mad to think I could ever\
  \ match them. No, Marigold, I am afraid it is back to the drudgery of pamphleteering\
  \ for me. Tell the convoy of container lorries to drive away. I shall weep and claw\
  \ some more and then I shall come home and pour milk into a bowl.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Right-o, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, brightly, \u201CAnd I shall put the kettle\
  \ on and pop the smokers\u2019 poptarts into the toaster.\u201D\nAnd thus dawned\
  \ a Friday morning in November. Far far away, in Texas, Lee Harvey Oswald woke from\
  \ an uneasy sleep, got ready for work, and before leaving the house, plopped his\
  \ wedding ring into a pale, translucent, blue-green china teacup with violets and\
  \ a golden rim that once belonged to his wife's grandmother.\n[2011-03-28]"
