text: "Apparently, I may have \u201Cwritten more nonsense than any other man living\u201D\
  , according to Sam Jordison in the online Guardian. I'm pleased to note, however,\
  \ that by the end of his article Mr Jordison acknowledges that Hooting Yard is a\
  \ fundamentally sensible place, sober and reasoned and measured.\nAddendum\_:\_\
  \ It occurs to me that a Guardian article is likely to lure many new readers here,\
  \ some of whom will flit swiftly away but others who will become entranced and quite\
  \ possibly spend the rest of their lives trawling through the Archives. To the latter,\
  \ may I draw your attention to the Donation box on the right? All this prose is\
  \ offered freely, I don't get paid, and I don't have a private income. I do need\
  \ to keep a variety of wolves from my door. End of begging letter.\n[2007-11-15]"
