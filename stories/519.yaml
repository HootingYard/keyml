text: "Over at BibliOdyssey, Peacay has a fantastic quotation from Robert Payne, in\
  \ a letter to Gilbert Sheldon written in 1650:\n\u201CThe truth is, this Jesuit,\
  \ as generally the most of his order, have a great ambition to be thoughte the greate\
  \ and learned men of the world; and to that end writes greate volumes, on all subjects,\
  \ with gay pictures and diagrams to set them forth, for ostentation And to fill\
  \ up those volumes, they draw in all things, by head and shoulders; and these too\
  \ for the most part, stolen from other authors. So that if that little, which is\
  \ their owne, were separated from what is borrowed from others, or impertinent to\
  \ their present arguments, their swollen volumes would shrink up to the size of\
  \ our Almanacks. But enough of these Mountebankes.\u201D\n[2008-09-01]"
