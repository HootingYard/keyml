text: "Cadmium! So soft, so ductile, so bluish-white, so bivalent, so high in fatigue\
  \ resistance! And yet so toxic! Is there a better metal with which to electroplate\
  \ your bird table?\nNot according to Hooting Yard's bird table electroplating expert\
  \ Sogennantes Chumpot, who has this to say:\n\u201CWhether you spell starling the\
  \ usual way or get it confused with Stalin, one thing is for sure. All starlings\
  \ love to alight on a bird table to peck millet and bread-crusts put out for them\
  \ by ornithologically-minded citizens. And not just starlings, but other birds too,\
  \ such as robins and goshawks and linnets. But in a climate where it seems always\
  \ to be raining, where wild winds howl, where eerie mists descend and the air grows\
  \ thick and muggy before great cataclysmic storms wreak ruination, even the best-made\
  \ bird table will rot away and topple sooner or later. By Christ, I have seen numberless\
  \ collapsed bird tables in my time, never without shedding tears as I then look\
  \ up into the bleak expansive skies to see flocks of starlings, and other birds,\
  \ kittiwakes and swifts and crows, skirling and swooping but with no sturdy untoppled\
  \ bird table upon which to land and take sustenance from the provender there freely\
  \ scattered by their human pals. It is a tragedy as old as time, best evoked, I\
  \ think, in that terribly sad opera by Bouff, The Collapsed Bird Tables Of Verona.\u201D\
  \nChumpot has more to say, much more, but as a scion of the great soap-making family\
  \ she has a tendency to prattle on, and I think we can safely interrupt. The point\
  \ is that she has gathered a vast trove of information on cadmium-electroplated\
  \ bird tables, and plans to make it available via a new web hub portal, with listings,\
  \ prices, and specifications, plus a bulletin board, chatroom, Witter feed, wiki,\
  \ forum, blog, stump, and rivets, all powered by Ubuntu! (I am not sure what that\
  \ all means, but I am copying from scribbled notes which may not be entirely accurate.\
  \ Chumpot was making her announcement on a lawn, on a common, and had to contend\
  \ with the racket made by a petrol-powered mowing machine, a brass band, and a very\
  \ noisy swarm of hornets.)\nFurther details will follow once Sogennantes Chumpot\
  \ actually sets up the website, which she plans to do as soon as it is safe to release\
  \ her from the remote isolation clinic where she is being held following a severe\
  \ bout of cadmium poisoning. I am not sure why she felt it necessary to\u2014in\
  \ her words\u2014\u201Cbecome a bird table, complete with cadmium electroplating,\
  \ in order to really get with the programme\u201D, but that is what she did, and\
  \ now she is paying the price. Hats off to her, say I.\n[2009-08-23]"
