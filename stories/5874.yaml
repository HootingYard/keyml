text: 'Exciting news from the BBC. Werner Herzog has been persuaded to direct a forthcoming
  episode of twee bucolic period drama Lark Rise To Candleford. This follows the unprecedented
  global success of the scene where the peasant sprawled in the drainage ditch recites
  Captain Beefheart''s Old Fart At Play.

  Herzog is currently working on the screenplay for his episode, which is likely to
  feature either a conquistador and a gang of howler monkeys laying waste to Dorcas
  Lane''s Candleford post office, and/or an attempt by a deranged impresario to build
  an opera house in the squalid village of Lark Rise.
