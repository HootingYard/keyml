  \ of Hoon\n  I am weird and uncanny\n  And I look at you funny\n  And wolves howl\
  \ at the full moon\nThis was, apparently, the song attributed to the handyman-gardener\
  \ of Hoon, a weird and uncanny fellow with a squint in one eye whose chief occupation\
  \ was the raking and shovelling of gravel. The song, thought to be broadly autobiographical,\
  \ was recorded by folk song collector Cecil Flat, to an accompaniment of piccolo,\
  \ accordion and marimbas. More recently, the argumentative German improv group Weltschmerz\
  \ devised an argumentative improv version, in which the words are recited in guttural\
  \ shouts against a backdrop of tuneless tape-recorded shovelling and raking of gravel.\
  \ Inevitably, this shot to the top of the hit parade and the band appeared on several\
  \ overexcitable teenage pop television shows. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed, in the\
  \ heaving throng of the studio mosh pit on one such show, an elderly man, weird\
  \ and uncanny, with a squint in one eye, holding in one hand a shovel and in the\
  \ other a rake. He appeared to have gravel sprinkled in his hair. He was only on\
  \ screen for a few seconds, but those who saw him were convinced they had spotted\
  \ the handyman-gardener of Hoon. Alas, this was in the days before Het Internet\
  \ and YouTube, and no copy of the broadcast is known to exist. We have only the\
  \ letters pages of the following week's teenage pop press to turn to.\nDear Teenage\
  \ Pop Press, reads one typical letter, Yesterday evening, as we do every week, my\
  \ family gathered around the bakelite television set in our ill-starred yet snug\
  \ hovel to watch The Overexcitable Teenage Pop Television Show. There were some\
  \ fantastic beat combos playing, including Agnetha and Anni-Frid and Benny and Bjorn,\
  \ John and Yoko, the Bernard Levin Madrigal Singers, Gordon Sumner's Gordon Sumner\
  \ Tribute Band, Level 42, A Flock Of Seagulls, Tony Gubba's Gubtastic Gubba Gubba\
  \ Hey Group, and a chap standing on one leg playing the flute. What we were waiting\
  \ for, of course, was the smash hit Song Of The Handyman-Gardener Of Hoon performed\
  \ by Weltschmerz. Now here is the intriguing thing. When the argumentative German\
  \ improv group were making a din with their shouting and their rakes and their shovels,\
  \ the camera cut away for a few seconds to the studio mosh pit, wherein a teeming\
  \ throng of overexcited teenage persons were cavorting and cutting capers, as is\
  \ de rigueuer. In among them, I am sure I spotted an elderly man, weird and uncanny,\
  \ with a squint in one eye, holding in one hand a shovel and in the other a rake,\
  \ who appeared to have gravel sprinkled in his hair. Could it be that this was the\
  \ handyman-gardener of Hoon himself? And if so, why was he in the mosh pit, rather\
  \ than up on stage with the band, shouting out his own song?\nIn the following week's\
  \ issue came a response:\nDear Teenage Pop Press, it read, Further to the letter\
  \ in last week's issue regarding the elderly man, weird and uncanny, with a squint\
  \ in one eye, holding in one hand a shovel and in the other a rake, who appeared\
  \ to have gravel sprinkled in his hair and who appeared for a few seconds on screen\
  \ during Weltschmerz's deafening performance of the Song Of The Handyman-Gardener\
  \ Of Hoon on television recently, I think the person your correspondent spotted\
  \ was me. I am elderly. I have been described, both by strangers and by members\
  \ of my own family as weird. There is certainly something uncanny to be seen whenever\
  \ I look in the mirror. On the evening in question I attended the television studio\
  \ with both a rake and a shovel about my person, for reasons I have been advised\
  \ by tiptop legal advisers not to bruit about in the popular press. The one point\
  \ on which I would take issue is that I did not have gravel sprinkled in my hair.\
  \ I tend my magnificent bouffant with great care, and would never be so neglectful\
  \ of its preening to allow gravel to become sprinkled in it. There is the possibility\
  \ that what your correspondent saw was electrical or electronic interference, given\
  \ the primitive state of transmission on black and white television screens at this\
  \ point in history, when we have not yet progressed to colour, or high definition,\
  \ or whatever further wonders the pipe-smoking boffins have up their sleeves. Though\
  \ it may be thought that I am a tad too elderly to go cavorting and cutting capers\
  \ in a mosh pit, it has long been my habit to go in search of the hero inside myself,\
  \ until I find the key to my life. This has led me down some unexpected by-ways.\
  \ It is not, for example, the only time I have been mistaken for the handyman-gardener\
  \ of Hoon, even by myself. The day after the television show I was taking a stroll\
  \ along the canal towpath near fields and a spinney and standing stones and an army\
  \ firing range surrounded by an electrified fence when I came to a rustic cottage.\
  \ Its grounds were strewn with gravel. As I had my shovel and my rake with me, for\
  \ reasons which again I am not minded to divulge, I took it in to my head to do\
  \ a spot of shovelling and raking of the gravel, on the spur of the moment. After\
  \ all, it occurred to me that this might be the key to my life. And so it proved.\
  \ I have been happily shifting about gravel with my rake and my shovel ever since,\
  \ and I am now waiting for the next full moon, to hear if wolves will howl, as was\
  \ foretold in the song.\nI have studied all available documentation from that time\
  \ and that place but am so far unable to confirm whether or not wolves did indeed\
  \ howl at the full moon. The only hint I found was a report in Recordings Of Wolves\
  \ Howling magazine, in which the member of Weltschmerz with the severest haircut\
  \ gave an argumentative interview in which he revealed that the band had been making\
  \ tape-recordings of the howling of wolves. He did not explain why.\n[2012-06-26]"
