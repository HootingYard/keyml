text: "\u201CIn place of a frog, we discover a point of hard, shrunken, cracked substance,\
  \ neither frog nor sole. We cut the clenches and take off the relic of ignorance\
  \ and barbarism, throwing it with hearty good-will into the only place fit to receive\
  \ it\u2014the pile of scrap-iron.\u201D\u2014John E Russell, Rational Horse-Shoeing,\
  \ 1873\nIn this passage, Russell is clearly casting aside \u201Cignorance and barbarism\u201D\
  , perhaps to atone for the mayhem caused by his earlier work Irrational Horse-Shoeing.\
  \ It was the latter book which had a profound influence on Dobson, who is known\
  \ to have read it from cover to cover at least forty times. Of course, the pamphleteer\
  \ had no interest in horses per se\u2014he could barely tell a Knabstrup from a\
  \ Yonaguni with his glasses on\u2014but the panting urgency of Russell's prose style\
  \ as he describes various completely bonkers approaches to shoeing horses was something\
  \ Dobson spent his entire curdled and despicable life trying to match. And so should\
  \ you.\n[2007-12-05]"
