text: "Last Sunday, 14th December, came and went without my realising that it marked\
  \ the fifth birthday of the Hooting Yard website. Belatedly crack open those bottles\
  \ of aerated lettucewater! (There was, of course, an earlier Hooting Yard site on\
  \ the interweb, but it was static, in that it contained various stories and pictures\
  \ and was very, very rarely updated.) We have come a long way, readers, you and\
  \ I, and I thank you for your support. Here, for the hell of it, is the very first\
  \ item posted. The Search Engine Lure referred to is buried somewhere in the Archive.\n\
  Vigilant readers of the Hooting Yard Search Engine Lure will note within it the\
  \ splendid word \u201Cbewolfenbuttlement\u201D. Like \u201Csolipsism\u201D, this\
  \ is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never caught on. When the\
  \ future George III was a teenager, his grandfather tried to marry him off to a\
  \ European princess, much to the dismay of George's mother. The name of the princess\
  \ was Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\xC3\xBC\
  ttel. Under his mother's influence, George became fretful and aghast at the proposal,\
  \ and\u2014as Walpole wrote\u2014he \u201Cdeclares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\u201D\
  . To resurrect the word successfully, perhaps it is necessary to widen it from the\
  \ sense of being forced into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything\
  \ one doesn't want to do. Start using it today!\n[2008-12-18]"
