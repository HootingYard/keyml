  \ a weekend postage at The Dabbler, where Mahlerman tells us about Havergal Brian's\
  \ Gothic Symphony, which\ncalls for up to one thousand performers, including nine\
  \ choirs, four offstage brass bands, and the normal orchestra size doubled-up to\
  \ about 150 players. A vast percussion section includes chains, a thunder machine\
  \ and a bird scare.\nThat Brian was one of the great British eccentrics has never\
  \ been in doubt\n\n[2011-11-22]"
