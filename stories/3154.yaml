text: "Only six issues of the children's comic Zig Et Puce were ever published. Our\
  \ correspondent Fatima Gilliblat has spent the last ten years writing a definitive\
  \ study of this milestone in Latin tot literature. Here is an extract from her forthcoming\
  \ book, a brief summary of the content of each issue.\n\nZig Et Puce, Number One.\
  \ Zig steals eggs from the Mavis Nest. Puce whittles a stick. Zig glows like a lightbulb.\
  \ Puce bangs a pan. Zig clocks off. Puce wears blue pyjamas.\nZig Et Puce, Number\
  \ Two. Zig, in an extremity of barbarian anguish, pops a cig into a dovecote. Puce\
  \ outbids a flapper at an auction. Zig melds tarp with gauze. Puce takes part in\
  \ a testimonial match for a retiring football ace who now has but the one leg. Zig\
  \ meets Tod. Puce murmurs, like the sea.\nZig Et Puce, Number Three. Zig crunches\
  \ twigs underfoot as he stalks his quarry. Puce spies a window of opportunity. Zig\
  \ goes to the gallows. Puce mucks about with currants. Zig looks like Eve Marie\
  \ Saint in On The Waterfront. Puce reads Simone De Beauvoir in her American circumstance.\
  \ Zig spits. Puce clanks.\nZig Et Puce, Number Four. Zig is embalmed within the\
  \ tomb of a great but anonymous ancient Egyptian monkey god king. Puce blots her\
  \ copybook. Zig has gum disease. Puce clings to the raft of the Medusa. Zig makes\
  \ much of much that has not panned out as planned. Puce goes for the Bob Stokoe\
  \ Memorial Bucket.\nZig Et Puce, Number Five (the notorious banned issue). Zig shows\
  \ grit. Puce, in tumbling, dislodges the Buttons of Beb, which cascade down the\
  \ mountainside and are scattered about the lanes of a village in a Swiss canton.\
  \ Zig foots the bill. Puce goes rogue. Zig is in a ditch with Tod and a cup and\
  \ an owl. Puce dissolves in water. Zig hails the chief. Puce watches Cowards Bend\
  \ The Knee, or The Blue Hands, with Latin intertitles.\nZig Et Puce, Number Six.\
  \ Zig milks a cow. Puce milks another cow. Zig pays a visit to the place where it\
  \ goes \u201Cclunk!\u201D. Puce keeps milking cows. Zig is a harbinger of harbours\
  \ and binges. Puce milks more and more cows. Zig crashes upon the rocks, like the\
  \ sea. Puce sashays along Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse. Zig whimpers. Puce bangs.\n[2009-09-18]"
