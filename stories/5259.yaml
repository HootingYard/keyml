text: "Our alphabetic postage experiment continues with E, which in this case stands\
  \ for Embargo\nI have decided to place an embargo on this postage. It is, or was\
  \ going to be, about the cargo of a barge. It was a large barge, freighted with\
  \ spectacularly interesting cargo, magnificent in both quantity and quality, on\
  \ an impossibly extensive canal system, beginning at Tack and terminating at Bluff.\
  \ But I have told you too much already, bearing in mind my embargo.\nThe reason\
  \ for the embargo could be termed \u201Cquaint,\u201D I suppose, were one to be\
  \ seeking a descriptive. To describe the nature of the embargo is not, necessarily,\
  \ to justify it, and I am aware that some readers may wish to have it so justified.\
  \ \u201COi,\u201D they will be braying, gobs wide and knuckles dragging along the\
  \ ground, \u201CWhat do you think you're up to, mister, putting an embargo on a\
  \ Hooting Yard postage?\u201D At least that is the kind of thing they might bray\
  \ if they could string a sentence together. Be assured I am referring only to a\
  \ tiny minority of my readers, the ones who gather, on Monday evenings, in the shabby\
  \ annexe just down the lane from the eerie mysterious barn at Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard,\
  \ there to squat on stools in mysterious eerie candlelight and to read my prose\
  \ aloud to each other. As it happens, the annexe is on the banks of the canal, so\
  \ the large barge with its tremendous cargo either will pass by or has already done\
  \ so, at the time of the gathering, in the autumnal dusk. I can appreciate that\
  \ they will fume and fret, wondering what in the name of heaven I would have had\
  \ to say about it, in fact, have said about it, or rather written about it, but\
  \ then, quaintly, embargoed. But I am not about to reverse my quaint decision. To\
  \ do so would catapult me into muddy waters, from which I might not emerge. Even\
  \ if I did emerge, I would be stained with mud, perhaps forever. \u201CYou could\
  \ go to the launderette!\u201D my Monday dusk readers might shout, voices raised\
  \ in a collective whinge.\nBut ah, launderette begins with L, and we have six postages\
  \ to post before we get that far. I am taking this alphabet seriously.\n[2010-09-20]"
