text: "The eerie silence of the past week or so has not been occasioned by the usual\
  \ vacancy-between-the-ears syndrome. On the contrary, Mr Key has been a busy buzzing\
  \ bee. I received a commission from the splendid Norm Sherman of the Drabblecast\
  \ to write a Lovecraftian tale for the podcast's annual celebration of the Rhode\
  \ Island master of purple prose. Thus I spent several days immersed in the world\
  \ of shoggoths and mad Arabs and hideous crawling chaos (with tentacles) and then\
  \ another couple of days tippy-tapping a tale that I hope will prove a fitting homage.\
  \ The text will be posted here after it has appeared on the Drabblecast.\n  I now\
  \ need to delovecraftise my brain, which is easier said than done. After reading\
  \ just a couple of stories, it is very easy to get completely sucked in by all that\
  \ nameless miasmic horror. Perhaps I will hoist myself out of it by writing a twee\
  \ story about Popsy the Pony in a buttercup-splattered meadow, or some such winsome\
  \ tosh. Watch this space.\n[2016-08-31]"
