text: "Members of the self-righteous wanker community often make the boast that they\
  \ Speak Truth To Power. Far more valuable, I think, is my own practice of Telling\
  \ Fibs To Impuissance.\nFor example, the other day I was prancing along the canal\
  \ towpath when I saw, lugging himself towards me on crutches, a penniless crippled\
  \ orphan dressed in rags.\n\u201CAhoy there, young wretch!\u201D I cried, imparting\
  \ as much condescension and contempt into my words as possible, \u201CDid you know\
  \ that the earth is as flat as a pancake?\u201D\nThe hobbledehoy was baffled and\
  \ distraught at this news, pleasingly so, and I continued.\n\u201CNot only that,\
  \ but the Munich Air Disaster took place in 1962, the Tet Offensive was something\
  \ to do with King Canute, and gooseberries fall from heaven upon the wide Sargasso\
  \ Sea, from where they are harvested by trained cormorants.\u201D\nTugging his greasy\
  \ forelock, the orphan child said \u201CThankee kindly, sir, when I arrive at my\
  \ self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity learning centre I shall pass on these nuggets\
  \ of wisdom in the exam paper I am sitting today.\u201D\n\u201CYou will pass with\
  \ flying colours!\u201D I replied, chortling inwardly as I pictured the impuissant\
  \ youth weeping copious tears upon learning that he has failed his exam with the\
  \ lowest of all possible scores.\nThen I snatched away his crutches and pushed him\
  \ into the canal, before passing on to an unbelievably luxurious cafeteria for a\
  \ slap-up breakfast.\nI did not prance along the canal towpath. I did not encounter\
  \ a crippled orphan. I did not have a slap-up breakfast.\n[2018-03-22]"
