text: 'In a thicket, with a compass, I am thinking about blubber. I use blubber for
  my candles. I''m the captain of a whaler. Some use tallow, I use blubber. It gets
  smoky in my cabin. I''m not in my cabin now. As I said, I''m in a thicket. I''m
  on shore leave for a fortnight. I''ve been hiking with the devil. Satan left me
  in a thicket on the wild and windy moors. But I''ve got my trusty compass and my
  pipe clamped in my jaws. I am smoking in the thicket. I hope to see my whaler soon.
  Don''t go hiking with the devil. Keep your compass in your pocket. I am thinking
  about blubber. Blubber is my candle light. It''s a comfort in this thicket on the
  wild and windy moors to think of blubber candle light, for the devil trapped me
  in this thicket and it is a pitch black night.
