  \ the Hooting Yard Christmas Special\u2014an hour-long (slightly edited) recording\
  \ of last month's Evening Of Lopsided Prose And Lugubrious Music at Woolfson & Tay\
  \ in Bermondsey Square. Those of you who were there will be able to relive those\
  \ golden moments, and those who were unable to attend can hear what you missed,\
  \ and gnash your teeth, and rend your garments in despair, after which you may want\
  \ to cheer yourselves up a little by sending Mr Key his Christmas money, via PayPal.\n\
  A podcast of the complete, unedited recording will be available shortly after the\
  \ broadcast, and I will of course post a link to it here.\n[2011-12-17]"
