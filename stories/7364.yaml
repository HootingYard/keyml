text: "\nMethod acting comes under the spotlight in my cupboard at The Dabbler this\
  \ week, and I thought it would be interesting to write the piece using the technique\
  \ of Method writing. The idea is to induce in oneself a state of mind where the\
  \ only \u201Cwriting\u201D which exists is the tracks of birds in snow\u2014marks\
  \ that are at once meaningless yet numinous. In this state, \u201Cliterature\u201D\
  \ has yet to come into being. Prose has to be invented anew. It is as if one were\
  \ Jeanette Winterson!\nTo get the hang of the momentous task before you, it is a\
  \ good idea to make a copy of the bird-tracks in the snow, for they are fugitive,\
  \ and when the snow melts, they will vanish forever. Go to a stationery shop or\
  \ a post office, and buy a pen and paper. When choosing a pen, say of the ballpoint\
  \ variety, make sure the tip is about the size of the primitive ganglia which constitute\
  \ the brain of a lobster.\nOut in the field, learn how to make marks, with the pen\
  \ upon the paper, which match precisely the patterns made by the tracks of birds\
  \ in the snow. This is the beginning of writing! Back at home, sat at an escritoire,\
  \ continue making such marks, but rather than mere copying allow yourself free rein.\
  \ Sooner or later, you will discover that the marks you are making will, as if by\
  \ a miracle, form literate prose!\n[2011-10-07]"
