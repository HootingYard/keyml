text: "If the press notices [of Austin Osman Spare's first West End gallery show]\
  \ were calculated to put many visitors off, there was something about them that\
  \ would prove positively attractive to a few. Among them was the so-called Wickedest\
  \ Man in the World, the self-styled Beast 666; and so it was that Aleister Crowley\
  \ came striding through the door of number 13 Bruton Street, grandly announcing\
  \ himself to the shy and awkward artist as the \u201CVicegerent of God upon Earth\u201D\
  \u2026 Spare thought he looked more like \u201Can Italian ponce out of work\u201D\
  , or so he told a friend years later. Perhaps with the benefit of four decades of\
  \ hindsight, he said this was what he had told Crowley at the time.\nFrom Austin\
