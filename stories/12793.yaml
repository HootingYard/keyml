text: "In correspondence received the other day, one of my readers described the eerie\
  \ Hooting Yard silence as a \u201Csummer recess\u201D. This is a splendid way to\
  \ think about what otherwise might be considered the alarming emptiness in my bonce.\
  \ So a quasi-official summer recess it is, punctuated by the occasional brief spot\
  \ of blather.\nMeanwhile, you can go and read about Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick\
  \ & Tich & Wynken, Blynken & Nod in The Dabbler, and you can hear the great Norm\
  \ Sherman reading A Weekend With An Owl God on the latest Drabblecast. As Norm says,\
  \ if you don't love Frank Key, you don't know what love is \u2026\n[2014-07-05]"
