text: "V is for Vinkensport, surely one of the most foolish\u2014and tedious\u2014\
  sports ever devised. I make no apologies for lifting the following description directly\
  \ from the Wikipedia (with minor tamperings and omissions):\n\u201CVinkensport (Dutch\
  \ for \u201Cfinch sport\u201D) is a competitive animal sport in which male chaffinches\
  \ are made to compete for the highest number of bird calls in an hour. Also called\
  \ vinkenzetting (Dutch for \u201Cfinch sitting\u201D), it is primarily active in\
  \ the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium.\n\u201CVinkensport traces its origins\
  \ to competitions held by Flemish merchants in 1596, and is considered part of traditional\
  \ Flemish culture. As of 2007, it is estimated that there were over 13,000 enthusiasts,\
  \ called vinkeniers (\u201Cfinchers\u201D), breeding 10,000 birds every year. Animal\
  \ rights activists have opposed the sport for much of its history.\n\u201CIn a contest,\
  \ a row of small cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up approximately\
  \ six feet apart along a street. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a\
  \ red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their call\u2014\
  most often transcribed as susk-e-wiet\u2014a tally mark in chalk is made on a long\
  \ wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the\
  \ contest.\n\u201CThe earliest known records of vinkeniers are from 1596. By the\
  \ late nineteenth century, vinkenzetting's popularity had diminished significantly,\
  \ but it saw a resurgence after the First World War.\n\u201CVinkeniers use a variety\
  \ of methods to increase the number of calls in their birds. Techniques to develop\
  \ singing aptitude include selective breeding programs, high-protein diets, and\
  \ stimulating them with music and recordings of bird song. As wild finches generally\
  \ begin singing during the spring mating season, keepers may also use artificial\
  \ lights placed in aviaries to encourage increased song.\n\u201CSome vinkeniers\
  \ claim that finches from the different regions of Belgium sing in different dialects,\
  \ with birds from Flanders singing \u201Cin Dutch\u201D and those from Wallonia\
  \ singing undesirably \u201Cin French\u201D. While minute regional differences in\
  \ song have been observed in the chaffinch (though not within Belgium), the differences\
  \ have only been reliably distinguishable by the use of sonograms. Taxonomically,\
  \ there are no officially-recognized subspecies of chaffinch within Belgium.\n\u201C\
  As with other sports, vinkensport has had its cheating scandals, as well as accusations\
  \ of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour,\
  \ and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one\
  \ contestant sang the exact same number of calls in two rounds, the box was opened\
  \ and a mini CD player was discovered within.\u201D\nThere is further material in\
  \ the original article about various cruelties practised by vinkeniers, which you\
  \ may\_go and read if you wish. I have not included it here because I know deep\
  \ in my heart that there is not a single Hooting Yard reader who would ever countenance\
  \ cruelty to our avian pals, and I do not wish to nauseate you.\nIf you are thinking\
  \ of taking up competitive Vinkensport, might I suggest that you may need to be\
  \ incarcerated in a mercy home for those plagued by criminal insanity directed towards\
  \ birds?\n[2010-10-04]"
