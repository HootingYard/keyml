text: "Who now remembers Camber Rilnt?\nIn the long ago, when I was a teenperson,\
  \ Camber Rilnt was, if not quite my hero, certainly a totemic figure, one I held\
  \ in awe. I pored over his name with something akin to reverence. Today, on a whim,\
  \ I tapped \u201CCamber Rilnt\u201D into Google, and it yielded absolutely no results\
  \ whatsoever. There are millions, probably billions of pages on the world wide interweb,\
  \ but if Google is to be believed, Camber Rilnt appears on none of them. He has\
  \ vanished down the plughole of history.\nAh! But I did find him, not once but twice,\
  \ hiding in plain sight, in a manner not traceable by Google's algorithms, but present\
  \ nevertheless. Camber Rilnt lives on!\nAs for you lot, devoted Hooting Yardists\
  \ all, do you remember Camber Rilnt? Can you track him down on the web, perhaps\
  \ in places I missed? Feel free to plunge into the Comments Bath to let me know.\n\
