text: "[Thanks once again to R. Previous episodes in this exciting series are gathered\
  \ here.]\nSo this tangle of thieves broke into the Phosphorescent Family Compound\
  \ one night. They stole, from one larder, a bag of phosphorus, and, from another\
  \ larder another, bigger, bag of phosphorus. Then they softly and suddenly vanished\
  \ away, like Snarks.\nIn the morning, upon discovering the robbery, Old Pappy Phosph\
  \ called the coppers. With inhuman speed, Detective Captain Cargpan was on the scene,\
  \ sniffing about and writing things with a pencil in his notepad.\n\u201CDon't you\
  \ worry, Old Pappy,\u201D he said, \u201CI'll have these ne'er-do-wells bang to\
  \ rights and being roughed up in the police station basement by my boys by midnight,\
  \ or my name isn't Detective Captain Cargpan and I'm not sniffing about and writing\
  \ things with a pencil in my notepad.\u201D\nOld Pappy Phosph put the kettle on\
  \ for a cup of phosphorescent tea.\nThe telephone rang at one minute past midnight.\n\
  \u201CDetective Captain Cargpan here. That noise you can hear in the background\
  \ is my boys roughing up the thieves who stole your bags of phosphorus last night.\
  \ I'm pleased to report we've caught them. Well, all but one of them, and he happens\
  \ to be the one who knows where they stashed their loot. So the case is not yet\
  \ closed. But don't you worry, Old Pappy, with a bit more roughing up and some bone-breaking\
  \ and skull-bashing and pincers and hammers and electric drills I think we'll find\
  \ our man, and, more importantly, your bags of phosphorus, possibly before I've\
  \ finished speaking.\n\u201CThe interesting thing about this tangle of thieves is\
  \ that they might have been cobbled together by the casting director of a BBC drama\
  \ production. They are achingly diverse in terms of ethnicity, gender, and sexuality,\
  \ even social class. It's quite an eye-opener, and has certainly raised my consciousness\
  \ and \_my inclusivity awareness.\n\u201CMore unusually, perhaps, the thieves run\
  \ a gamut of body types, not from fat to thin or tall to short, as you might expect,\
  \ but in terms of skeletal rigidity. At one end there is a bloke whose bones\u2014\
  the ones not yet broken by my boys\u2014are almost fused together, so he is completely\
  \ stiff from head to toe, while at the other end is a fellow with bones like jelly,\
  \ he is absolutely floppy.\n\u201CIn case you were wondering, the one who got away\
  \ when we raided their den under the viaduct near the wasp sanctuary is gay and\
  \ limp, so keep your eyes peeled in case you see somebody of that description.\u201D\
  \nAs he spoke, Old Pappy Phosph saw, climbing up the perimeter fence of the compound,\
  \ the gay limp thief, come to return the stolen bags of phosphorus.\nTen minutes\
  \ later, pinned to the wall of the kitchen, pierced like St Sebastian, so held in\
  \ place awaiting the arrival of Detective Captain Cargpan, the gay limp thief confessed\
  \ all to Old Pappy Phosph. He explained that his conscience was stricken and he\
  \ regretted what he had done, and so he intended to return the stolen bags of phosphorus\
  \ to their larders in hope of forgiveness.\n\u201CI don't believe in forgiveness,\u201D\
  \ said Old Pappy Phosph, driving home another phosphorescent pin to more securely\
  \ affix the thief to the wall.\n\u201COuch!\u201D said the thief, not for the first\
  \ time that night.\nThere is a moral to this story, and it is plain and simple.\
  \ Don't mess with Detective Captain Cargpan or with Old Pappy Phosph. Both of them\
  \ will have your guts for garters.\n[2014-08-18]"
