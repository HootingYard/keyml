text: "Here at Hooting Yard we are regularly inundated with queries relating to eggs.\
  \ Here, for example, is a plaintive plea from reader Tim Thurn:\nQ\u2014When you\
  \ are dining with an intimate friend, and an omelette au rhum is served, what do\
  \ you do?\nMy spies tell me that Tim has copied out this question from Rambles In\
  \ Womanland by Max O'Rell (1903), wherein the answer is given thus:\nA\u2014Without\
  \ any ceremony, you take a spoon, and, taking the burning liquid, you pour it over\
  \ the dish gently and unceasingly. If you are careless, and fail to keep the pink\
  \ and blue flame alive, it goes out at once, and you have to eat, instead of a delicacy,\
  \ a dish fit only for people who like, or are used to have, their palates scraped\
  \ by rough food. If you would be sure to be successful, you will ask your friend\
  \ to help you watch the flame, and you will even ask him to lift the omelette gently\
  \ so that the rhum may be poured all over it until the whole of the alcohol contained\
  \ in the liquor is burned out.\nI might add that taking a spoon without any ceremony\
  \ is easier said than done, but my remarks on that will have to wait for our series\
  \ on spoons and ceremonies, which is forthcoming.\n[2011-10-16]"
