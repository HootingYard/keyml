text: "While the alignment of tree clumps in the West Kent area has rightly attracted\
  \ the attention of some our most sensible investigators, the alignment of tree clumps\
  \ in the East Kent area has been criminally neglected\u2014until now. One of the\
  \ most startling findings of the recent Bl\xF6tzmann study, published in Tree Clump\
  \ Alignment News, is that the alignment of the tree clumps in the eastern part of\
  \ the county is significantly more intriguing than the alignment of tree clumps\
  \ in the western part of the county. Studied from one angle, for example, a particular\
  \ set of eastern tree clumps is identical to the alignment of Abraham Zapruder,\
  \ Badge Man, Umbrella Man, Marymoon Man, JFK, and the sixth floor window of the\
  \ Texas Schoolbook Depository at the precise moment the first shot was fired on\
  \ that fateful November day in 1963 in Dallas. Viewed from a different angle, the\
  \ very same tree clumps are aligned in a pattern one can only call chaotic. A second\
  \ set of tree clumps, more easterly in Kent than the so called \u201CAssassination\
  \ Clumps\u201D, reproduces exactly the disposition of the players on the pitch at\
  \ the moment when South Africa scored the opening goal in the 2010 World Cup, a\
  \ goal described calmly by the television commentator as \u201Cone of the most important\
  \ moments in the entire history of sport\u201D. Yet, again, seen from another angle\
  \ these very same tree clumps form merely a random pattern.\nThe various angles\
  \ to which I refer are those obtaining between the tree clumps on the ground and\
  \ the position of the Bl\xF6tzmann Tree Clump Project airship in the sky. Obviously,\
  \ the position of the tree clumps on the ground is fixed, while the position of\
  \ the airship in the sky is variable. I probably do not need to explain this, but\
  \ am doing so in case you are extremely stupid. Those of you who believe that tree\
  \ clumps on the ground are not stationary may have been malignly influenced by great\
  \ works of literature, such as Macbeth, or infantile pieces of tosh, like all that\
  \ Tolkien twaddle. If you happen to live in the East Kent area you may have seen\
  \ the Bl\xF6tzmann dirigible hovering at varying points in the sky. It looks not\
  \ unlike the ill-fated Hindenburg (without the inferno of flames, obviously) although\
  \ it is clearly identifiable from the word BL\xD6TZMANN in big bold block capital\
  \ letters emblazoned across its side. It does not identify itself specifically as\
  \ the Tree Clump Project airship, for it is used in many another of Bl\xF6tzmann's\
  \ exciting activities, at least in those which require an airship for their completion\
  \ and hoped-for success.\nFrom the above it should be clear that proper perception\
  \ of the alignment of the East Kent tree clumps depends to a large extent on the\
  \ altitude and position of the airship. At ground level, it is almost impossible\
  \ to appreciate the significant patterns created by the tree clumps. One can trudge\
  \ about in one's rambling gear among the \u201CAssassination Clumps\u201D or the\
  \ \u201CHistory Of Sport Clumps\u201D, or indeed among the other tree clumps I have\
  \ not mentioned, and be none the wiser. That is why we should be grateful to Bl\xF6\
  tzmann for making such admirable use of his airship, rather than leaving it neglected\
  \ in its giant hangar, as some other airship owners do. I am not naming names, but\
  \ they know who they are.\nBl\xF6tzmann's interest in the alignment of tree clumps\
  \ in the East Kent area was prompted not, surprisingly, by Tony Wedd's important\
  \ study of the alignment of tree clumps in the West Kent area, but by a stray reference\
  \ in a yellowing old copy of the St Bibblybibdib's Parish Magazine And Religious\
  \ Tirade, where a writer identified only as \u201CRighteous Wanderer In The Woods\u201D\
  \ makes mention of a wander in the woods when his righteousness was tempted by some\
  \ sort of hobgoblin tree spirit, green and pagan and covered in leaves and twigs.\
  \ The author claims that, after fleeing from this sprite in fear for his immortal\
  \ soul, he lay in the bath and realised that the trajectory of his fleeing, if represented\
  \ in diagrammatic form, was analagous to the pattern made by a journeyman hiking\
  \ between the cantons of Switzerland in alphabetical order. Bl\xF6tzmann made the\
  \ intuitive leap, in reading this, to a recognition that further significant patterns\
  \ could reveal themselves through close study of the alignment of such things as\
  \ tree clumps, piles of pebbles, and even the distribution across the landscape\
  \ of airship hangars.\nIt is the latter to which he will next turn his attention,\
  \ and I am proud to say that, before taking off in the Bl\xF6tzmann airship, he\
  \ will be making much use of my database of hangars, which I compiled in order to\
  \ fire off a series of sternly-worded poison pen letters to their owners. For the\
  \ benefit of readers I would have liked to transcribe one of the letters here. Alas,\
  \ they proved so toxic as to be lethal, and I would not wish any of you to keel\
  \ over and perish, like a budgerigar zapped by a death ray.\n[2010-06-12]"
