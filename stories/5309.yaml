text: "O is for Ozymandias\n\u201CMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, / Look on\
  \ my Works ye Mighty, and despair!\u201D\nNow as it happens, I am mighty, and I\
  \ was hanging around one Thursday morning on the boundless and bare lone and level\
  \ sands, and I took the opportunity to look on the works of the King of Kings, and\
  \ I did not despair. What I did was guffaw. Well, first I belched, for I had just\
  \ finished eating a big pie, two dozen blackbirds baked in puff pastry, with a side\
  \ helping of spring onions and marmalade. I belched, and then I guffawed. Not everyone\
  \ is able to emit a full-throated guffaw, in all its glory, but I can. I used to\
  \ be a chuckler, but that was before I embraced my mightiness, and developed a guffaw\
  \ to go with it. I was taught it by a mountebank, on a seaside pier, far away from\
  \ the sands on which I was prancing on that Thursday morning.\nI had been sent to\
  \ inspect the works of Ozymandias by one mightier than myself, if you can imagine\
  \ such a personage. This unbelievably mighty wight was so mighty he would have flicked\
  \ Ozymandias from his mighty presence as if the King of Kings were a mere fly, or\
  \ a bluebottle. He, my mighty employer, had not had a moment to spare to go and\
  \ see the works of Ozymandias, but he had heard reports, and was aware of the accepted\
  \ wisdom that looking on them could plunge him into despair. Such a prospect confounded\
  \ his mighty brain, so he took me on as a sort of surveyor-emissary, at a handsome\
  \ salary.\n\u201CGo thou and look upon the works of Ozymandias, King of Kings!\u201D\
  \ he boomed in his mighty baritone at the conclusion of my interview, \u201CAnd\
  \ make haste to return to my mighty office on the top floor of this mighty skyscraper,\
  \ and tell me of your findings. Though you are a mere speck of weediness in comparison\
  \ to me, you are yet sufficiently mighty to be in a position to test the authenticity\
  \ of Ozymandias\u2019 claim.\u201D\nBefore leaving the skyscraper, I called in to\
  \ the PX to collect a wadge of pie-coupons. As I was counting them, and calculating\
  \ how many blackbird pies I would be able to devour during my survey, it so happened\
  \ that the mountebank who had taught me to guffaw popped in.\n\u201CI hear you are\
  \ going to look on the works of Ozymandias, King of Kings,\u201D he said.\n\u201C\
  Gosh, news travels mightily fast in this skyscraper,\u201D I replied.\n\u201CThat\
  \ it does, that it does,\u201D said the mountebank, \u201CBut remember, this skyscraper,\
  \ mighty as it is, will one day topple, or be toppled, and be nought but dust and\
  \ ashes. In fact, I have it on good authority that such topplement may well occur\
  \ before you have time to return from the boundless and bare lone and level sands\
  \ for which you are headed.\u201D\n\u201CReally?\u201D I asked.\nThe mountebank\
  \ tapped a finger on the side of his nose in the universal gesture of conspiratorial\
  \ scalliwaggery, and then he swept away, his cape billowing behind him with controlled\
  \ urgency and stylish \xE9lan.\nAnd that is why, on that Thursday morning some weeks\
  \ later, I guffawed as I looked on the works of Ozymandias, King of Kings. For the\
  \ mighty skyscraper had toppled, and in its topplement my mighty employer had perished.\
  \ I had my fat salary, and half my wadge of pie-coupons, and a belly full of blackbird\
  \ pie and spring onions and marmalade, and I need never return from the boundless\
  \ and bare lone and level sands. Here I could build my own mighty works, and guffaw\
  \ at the universe! Now there was none mightier than me!\n[2010-09-27]"
