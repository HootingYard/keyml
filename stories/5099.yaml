  \ authorities to tax, police, manage, and monitor the spatial whereabouts of individuals\
  \ within a population.\_ Despite the central importance of the street address as\
  \ a political technology that sometimes met with resistance, few scholars have examined\
  \ the historical practice of street addressing with respect to its broader social\
  \ and political implications\u2026\_ We are particularly interested in showcasing\
  \ recent work that links the history of urban house numbering to broader debates\
  \ concerning the interrelations of space, knowledge, and power that have animated\
  \ contemporary discussions in the social sciences and humanities.\u201D\nCall for\
  \ papers for a special section in the journal Urban History on the history of urban\
  \ house numbering, cited in Pseuds\u2019 Corner, Private Eye, No. 1269, 20 August\u2014\
  2 September 2010.\nIn his days as an armchair revolutionary, Blodgett became peculiarly\
  \ exercised about urban house numbering. He lived at the time at 6 Rolf Harris Mew.\
  \ Most Mews are plural, but this one wasn't. There were nine bijou little dwellings\
  \ in the Mew, and with what Blodgett identified as a typically hegemonic capitalist\
  \ patriarchal linear system of oppression they were numbered, consecutively, from\
  \ one to nine.\nBlodgett had to subject this system to a rigorous poststructuralist\
  \ interrogation before he was in a position to subvert it, and this he did, strolling\
  \ up and down the Mew making notes, accompanied by impossibly complicated diagrams,\
  \ in his jotting pad. Across the way, crippled mendicants, brought to such a state\
  \ of destitution that they were lower even than the lowest of the lumpenproletariat,\
  \ wallowed in their own filth and wailed for crumbs. Blodgett occasionally went\
  \ over to consult with these wretches, garnering their views on his important research.\n\
  His first step in defiance of an unconscionable tyranny was to upend his door number\
  \ so that it looked like a 9 rather than a 6. For this blow against the system he\
  \ was shouted at by the postie and beaten insensible with a club by the occupant\
  \ of number 9. Blodgett had, of course, expected violence as the response to his\
  \ supremely transgressive act. But, he asked himself as he lay bandaged in a clinic,\
  \ was it transgressive enough?\nWhen he was well enough to return home, he stole\
  \ out one night and, using a screwdriver, removed the door number from each house\
  \ in the Mew. He made a pyre of them and set them ablaze, using an oil-soaked rag\
  \ liberated from one of the mendicants. By the light of the fire, he took a paint\
  \ pot and daubed upon each door a slogan of resistance. For this, he was again shouted\
  \ at by the postie, and again beaten insensible by the occupant of number 9, a person\
  \ labouring under false consciousness who was joined, on this occasion, by three\
  \ or four of the neighbours.\nThis time, upon his discharge from the clinic, Blodgett\
  \ discovered that all trace of his daubings had been erased, and brand new metal\
  \ numbers affixed to the doors, except his own, which now had nailed to it, in a\
  \ clear plastic bag as protection from the incessant rainfall, a notice from the\
  \ civic authorities. Blodgett sat on the stoep to read it. In essence, it told him\
  \ that he was a fathead and an idiot.\nPoor Blodgett! For a while it looked as if\
  \ he might be homeless, and have to join the wretched untermenschen across the way.\
  \ But then he had one of his magnificent Blodgettian brainwaves. He scampered off\
  \ to the civic authorities\u2019 oppressive brutalist headquarters and explained\
  \ to an official that he was an artist. This declaration did the trick. He was welcomed\
  \ back to Rolf Harris Mew as a returning prodigal, even by the bourgeois scum at\
  \ number 9, and resumed his activities, talking Twaddle to Power.\n[2010-08-23]"
