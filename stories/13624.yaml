text: "On Thursday I remarked that it was hard to imagine a window made out of crows.\
  \ Not for the first time, I was wrong\u2014astonishingly so, given that ornithology\
  \ is involved. But wrong nonetheless, as this letter from Poppy Nisbet makes clear.\
  \ It plopped through the post all the way from the eastern United States:\nIn the\
  \ long ago I occasionally worked on local theatrical extravaganzas, my favorite\
  \ being \u201CZeitgeist\u201D, an excruciating interpretation of Human Life from\
  \ beginning to end. We, the perpetrators of this cultural maelstrom, took over the\
  \ very small town hall in a very small town nearby. The building had a central front\
  \ door and hallway flanked by two minuscule offices and leading to a large open\
  \ room with a stage at the far end. As a preface to the main event onstage we made\
  \ the offices into a birth room and a death room. It is the death room that requires\
  \ description.\nThe house I now live in had belonged to artists for a long time\
  \ and the higgledy-piggledy remains of their art lives were still in the barn studio\
  \ when I moved here. One of the artists was a portrait painter of subjects who all\
  \ looked like characters from Agatha Christie. The studio was overflowing with petrified\
  \ tubes of oil paint, bristle-free brushes, canvas stretchers, human bones, broken\
  \ glass and empty frames, my favorite relics being paintings with the faces cut\
  \ out and the rest of the image left intact. As a backdrop for the death room these\
  \ edited portraits were hung on the walls above dead leaves piled high, so deep\
  \ that people could only wade through them with difficulty. The resultant noise\
  \ was full of memories.\nThe room had a dilemma that demanded solving, a large window\
  \ facing the parking lot. We felt that the evening trajectories of headlights would\
  \ spoil the mood on the night of the performance so we cut silhouettes of flying\
  \ crows out of a piece of black foam-core board and fitted it over the glass. A\
  \ sheer curtain was hung over this on the inside, making the window amendments invisible\
  \ in the general murk.\nThe headlights swept through the birds like a fog beacon,\
  \ flaring up for a moment and projecting distorted avian outlines onto the folds\
  \ of the curtain and the floating dust of the leaves. It left a surging impression\
  \ of flight that was surprisingly spooky. Even now, whenever I see crows I remember\
  \ the motion of light in black bird shapes filling up a window.\n[2015-01-03]"
