text: "While I have been beavering away at my alphabet, a few other things have cropped\
  \ up which I couldn't easily slot into the scheme. Among them, this:\n\u201COne\
  \ evening, an acquaintance of mine, who is an Irish writer of some repute, having\
  \ drunk rather more than was good for him, a by no means unusual occurrence, in\
  \ attempting to stagger home from his club, by some means he could never quite explain,\
  \ got into a strange house instead of his own, and found himself in a semi-dark\
  \ room full of queer-looking people, male and female, clad in leopard skins. Being\
  \ given a skin by a dark, foreign-looking girl, he tried to put it on and, in spite\
  \ of his addled senses, he so far succeeded that no one appeared to notice it was\
  \ upside down. Probably no one paid any heed to him, everyone's attention being\
  \ centred on a woman, who was standing in the middle of the room, haranguing them.\
  \ My friend could not see her very distinctly owing to the lights being turned down,\
  \ but he judged her to be coloured, she looked so dark, and not a British subject,\
  \ as she spoke with a decided foreign accent. The cool night air, blowing into the\
  \ room, through an open window near at hand, gradually sobered him, and his brain\
  \ became quite clear. He realised then that the people around him belonged to some\
  \ strange exotic cult, and finally the amazing fact that they were Leopard and Panther\
  \ People dawned on him.\u201D\nThe quotation is from Strange Cults And Secret Societies\
  \ Of Modern London by Elliott O'Donnell, published in 1934. If his book is to be\
  \ believed, Mr O'Donnell could hardly walk into a pub or a hotel lobby, or stroll\
  \ through a park, without bumping into someone who had an astonishing tale to tell\
  \ of weird and hitherto unsuspected goings-on in the city and its suburbs. You will\
  \ be hearing more from him in coming days.\n[2010-10-06]"
