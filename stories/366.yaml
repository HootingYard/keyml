text: "Hmm. There was a real danger there that the whole month of February could pass\
  \ in an uncanny silence here at Hooting Yard. That would never do. I could claim\
  \ that the lack of posts was due to the fact that I was pooped out in Droitwich,\
  \ but I don't suppose that would convince anybody. The briefest interrogation would\
  \ reveal that I have never been to Droitwich and, indeed, am not even clear where\
  \ on earth it is. One thing I know, or at least suspect, about Droitwich is that\
  \ its name is derived from the French droit, or right, which leads me to wonder\
  \ if there is a rive gauche there. If I ever went to Droitwich, would I have the\
  \ right to act gauchely on the rive gauche? But that is an academic question.\n\
  So, if I did not spend February pooped out in Droitwich, what kept me from adding\
  \ to the torrent of Hooting Yard prose? Is there any truth in the rumour that I\
  \ have been busy burnishing the golden helmet of Anaxagrotax with swarfega and rags?\
  \ I admit that I am the source of the rumour, and it has even less credence than\
  \ the Droitwich story. After all, just how much burnishing does even the most golden\
  \ of all helmets worn by Anaxagrotax actually need, in this day and age? \u201C\
  Not that much,\u201D I hear you say, dismissively. Some among you probably believe\
  \ that there is no such thing as a golden helmet of Anaxagrotax in the first place,\
  \ nor that Anaxagrotax is or was anything but a figure of the imagination.\nIncidentally,\
  \ a figure of the imagination is not the same thing as a figure in the carpet. The\
  \ best known figure in the carpet I am aware of is the one in the story of that\
  \ name by Henry James. For some time now I have been pondering whether there would\
  \ be any point in mashing together some of James\u2019 stories to create entirely\
  \ new pieces of fiction. For instance, one could take The Figure In The Carpet and\
  \ his novella The Reverberator, described as \u201Ca delightful Parisian bonbon\u201D\
  , and somehow stitch the two of them together. The result might be very interesting,\
  \ or then again it could be deeply flawed. It's the kind of task I can imagine completing\
  \ in the attic room of a house on the rive gauche in Droitwich, penniless, subsisting\
  \ on a diet of stale pastries and tapwater, lumbering forth from the room of an\
  \ evening to haunt the Droitwich streets in a shabby and threadbare overcoat. Of\
  \ course, that is a rather adolescent fantasy of the romantic artist based on a\
  \ vague memory of reading about the young Edvard Munch, and as such ought to be\
  \ consigned to one's mental dustbin.\nThe other day I saw municipal work operatives\
  \ spraying communal metal, as opposed to mental, dustbins with disinfectant spray.\
  \ These masked men laid all the bins on their sides, then powered up a generator\
  \ attached to their municipal van and let rip with the high-powered spray. It was\
  \ an exciting moment for me, as I don't get out much. I wonder what form of spray\
  \ could be used to perform a similar function on my mental dustbin, if, indeed,\
  \ such action is necessary. I must do some research to find out if there are available\
  \ any invigorating sprays designed to slosh out the brain. I suppose such a spray,\
  \ should one exist, could be applied nasally, or via the ears, if aimed properly.\
  \ I would prefer not to have to undergo trepanning.\nA keen devotee of the benefits\
  \ of trepanning is the sixties folk popstrel Julie Felix, if you can remember her.\
  \ She had a 1970 hit with El Condor Pasa, I think before she had any holes drilled\
  \ into her skull. You can read all about these matters in The People With Holes\
  \ In Their Heads by John Michell.\nSo there we are, February's silence broken. More\
  \ tomorrow. Comments welcome as ever.\n[2008-02-28]"
