text: "\u201CAre not some men themselves meere poisons by nature? for these slanderers\
  \ and backbiters in the world, what doe they else but lance poison out of their\
  \ black tongues, like hideous serpents? what doe these envious persons, but with\
  \ their malicious and poisonfull breath sindge and burne all before them that they\
  \ can reach or meet with, finding fault with every thing whatsoever? Are they not\
  \ well and fitly compared to those cursed souls flying in the dark, which albeit\
  \ they sequester themselves from birds of the day, yet they bewray their spight\
  \ and envy even to the night and the quiet repose thereof, by their heavie grones\
  \ (the only voice that they utter) disquieting and troubling those that be at rest:\
  \ and finally, all one they be with those unluckie creatures, which if they happen\
  \ to meet or crosse the way upon a man, presage alwaies some ill toward, opposing\
  \ themselves (as it were) to all goodnesse, and hindering whatsoever is profitable\
  \ for this life. Neither do these monstrous and abominable sprites know any other\
  \ reward of this their deadly breath, their cursed and detestable malice, but to\
  \ hate and abhor all things.\u201D\nPliny The Elder, The Naturall Historie, The\
