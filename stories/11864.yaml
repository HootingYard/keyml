text: "\nIn her mad poem Daddy, Sylvia Plath makes mention of \u201Ca bag full of\
  \ God\u201D. I have always taken this to be a misprint. If we consider that God\
  \ is inexplicable and ineffable, outwith the scope of our puny human comprehension,\
  \ then the idea that we could get hold of Him and stuff Him into a bag is plainly\
  \ laughable. We can apply David Hume's argument against miracles, where he writes\
  \ \u201CWhen anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately\
  \ consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either\
  \ deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have\
  \ happened\u201D. Similarly, we may ask which is more probable, that somebody has\
  \ managed to cram God into a bag, or that a typesetting error has occurred? I am\
  \ as sure as eggs is eggs that what Plath originally wrote was \u201Ca bag full\
  \ of Goo\u201D. A slapdash printer made \u201CGoo\u201D into \u201CGod\u201D, and\
  \ the error has persisted for half a century.\nNow it is true that goo is more often\
  \ found in bottles and jars and squeezy tubes than in bags. But there are so many\
  \ different types of goo, for so many different purposes, that a bag full of goo\
  \ is still a far more likely proposition than a bag full of God. Just wander along\
  \ the aisles of your nearest supermarket and you will see goos for cleaning, for\
  \ cooking, for cosmetic purposes, and for all sorts of other uses. Too, goo can\
  \ vary from thick pastes to semi-liquid gloop, and no matter what its consistency,\
  \ any goo can be transferred from its original container into a bag, be it a plastic\
  \ bag, a paper bag, a greaseproof paper bag, a satchel, a haversack, a pippy bag,\
  \ or any sort of bag you care to mention.\nWhile we can only guess at the type of\
  \ bag Sylvia Plath has in mind\u2014and I strongly favour the duffel bag theory\u2014\
  we are on firmer ground when it comes to the goo. For, later in the mad poem, the\
  \ mad poet specifically refers to \u201Cgobbledygoo\u201D. Quite what the nature\
  \ of this goo is must remain a matter of conjecture. In the context of the poem,\
  \ it has some connection to the Luftwaffe, the German word for national military\
  \ aviation services. Might gobbledygoo, then, be some kind of lubricant goo for\
  \ aeroplane engines? If so, that would explain why, when I went to my local supermarket\
  \ and asked at the customer services counter if they stocked gobbledygoo, I was\
  \ met with blank looks of incomprehension. Aeroplane engine lubricant goo is not\
  \ the kind of goo you will find in even the best-appointed supermarket or general\
  \ goods store.\nSuch fearless textual analysis casts Daddy in a new light, and will\
  \ necessitate the urgent revision of the thousands of scholarly books and articles\
  \ about poor mad Sylvia\u2014so get to work, litcrit persons!\nOne final note\_\
  : goo must not be confused with goop, which is a digital media and e-commerce company\
  \ founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, who is inexplicable and ineffable and outwith the\
  \ scope of our puny human comprehension.\n[2013-08-18]"
