text: "The weedy, asthmatic, fey and trembling poet Dennis Beerpint has, I am afraid\
  \ to say, been caught red-handed in an act of blatant plagiarism. The title piece\
  \ in his latest slim volume of twee verse, Swamp Demons, And Other Demons, And Other\
  \ Swamps, has been copied word for word from the August-September 1936 issue of\
  \ Weird Tales magazine, where it was correctly ascribed to the writer C A Butz.\
  \ Reclining on a divan, feeling faintly ill, Beerpint has refused to comment on\
  \ his act of poetic perfidy. Here is Butz's original verse.\nThe lights that wink\
  \ across the sodden moor\nLike phosphorescent eyes that beckon men\nTo risk fell\
  \ footsteps in the treacherous fen,\nAnd sink in loathsome muck, without a spoor\
  \ \u2014\nWhat ghosts of former days, what dread allure,\nAbides within this subterranean\
  \ den?\nOr, reaching out, snares victims to its ken,\nWith wraith-like fingers,\
  \ to a peril sure?\n\u2018Tis told that evil things lurk out of sight\nWith human\
  \ bones that fester in the ooze;\nBelike 'tis true, these bones that once were clothed\n\
  In fleshly form now harbour deadly spite\nAgainst the living, and this swamp still\
  \ brews\nWithin its bubbling depths the curse men loathed\nBefore they turned to\
  \ leprous Things of Night!\n[2011-04-21]"
