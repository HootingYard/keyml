text: "That tiresome spring there appeared in the town a man surpassing grubby. The\
  \ sheer filthiness of him, in body and soul, caused untold jitters in the townsfolk.\
  \ Tongues wagged in taverns, and they did more than wag. There was spitting and\
  \ cursing and imprecation, until hotheads were quieted by the sending of a citizens\u2019\
  \ delegation to the good burghers of the town. These burghers were good, and they\
  \ were elderly, and had terrific beards, and some were blind or losing their sight,\
  \ but this betokened, for the townsfolk, great wisdom, on account of lore and legend.\n\
  A hammer thumped thrice upon a panel indicated the good burghers had made a decision,\
  \ and the townsfolk gathered in the square to hear it pronounced. The grubby man\
  \ was to be coaxed into a tub of hot water, and scrubbed with soapy brushes, scrubbed\
  \ and rinsed and scrubbed and rinsed until all trace of visible filth was expunged,\
  \ and he would step from the tub to be enwrapped in a large rectangular towel albino\
  \ white while the water in the tub was poured down a drain into the sewer.\nAnd\
  \ so it came to pass.\nBut voices were raised, in taverns and on street corners\
  \ and in civic hubs of social cohesion. The visible filth still lurked below, in\
  \ the sewer, bubbling and frothing and ready at any time to burst up through the\
  \ piping, and also, also, never forget, there was the grubbiness of the grubby man's\
  \ soul, invisible yet the more potent for that. A second citizens\u2019 delegation,\
  \ a second thumping of the hammer, a second gathering in the market square.\nThis\
  \ time the good burghers made two determinations, to meet the two concerns of the\
  \ townsfolk. First, that each day, forever, the sewers would be scrubbed and rinsed,\
  \ with brushes and hot water and carbolic soap, scrubbed and rinsed from end to\
  \ end, by volunteers. Second, that the grubby man would endure a course of moral\
  \ instruction and his soul examined daily, for hours and hours, under duress, until\
  \ every fleck of turpitude was obliterated in the pitiless light of Bl\xF6tzmannist\
  \ Lovely Thought.\nAnd so it came to pass.\nAnd hard as it may be to hold in your\
  \ head, that man surpassing grubby became, oh after many a year of instruction and\
  \ examination, a pillar of the community, never quite a good burgher yet one whose\
  \ advice was sought by townsfolk young and old on such matters as dogs and cats\
  \ and postal deliveries and running track maintenance and lamppost height and Belisha\
  \ beacon brightness and the fish market and soup recipes and ballet troupe recruitment\
  \ and gusts of wind and air temperature and flocks of swooping scavenger birds and\
  \ bus stop furniture and mountaineering equipment and oil waste and Japanese fog\
  \ monitoring systems and duck calls and the vanity of human wishes and snow flurries\
  \ and the raking of autumn leaves and pig feeding and the brains of lobsters and\
  \ the Flemish Primitives and mulching garden plots and filth and muck and untold\
  \ grubbiness.\nFor scrub and rinse as they might, the volunteers never quite managed\
  \ to eradicate the visible filth from the sewer.\nAnd on the seventh day, petals\
  \ fell in Petaluma.\n[2010-03-24]"
