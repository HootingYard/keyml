text: "I was very excited the other day to receive a letter inviting me to take part\
  \ in the television programme My Favourite Jesuit. Some of you may not be familiar\
  \ with the show, which is broadcast on Channel Ignatius Loyola on weekday evenings\
  \ at 7.00 PM. In each episode, three guests are given a slot to make the case for\
  \ their favourite Jesuit. There is then a viewers\u2019 poll and one of the three\
  \ priests is named Top Jesuit. And that's it! No prizes, no beatifications, just\
  \ the joy, for the winning panellist, of having made the most persuasive case, and\
  \ the consolation, for the two losing panellists, of having done their best, and\
  \ garnered at least a few votes.\nAfter reading the letter, and emitting a whoop!,\
  \ and filing it in my letter-filing system under J for Jesuit and then sub-filing\
  \ it under T for television shows pertaining to Jesuits, it took me about thirty\
  \ seconds to decide which Jesuit's cause I would champion. My first, and immediate,\
  \ thought was of course Gerard Manley Hopkins. But then I removed the letter from\
  \ its sub-file and read it again, and noted in the small print that the producers\
  \ had barred Father Hopkins as a candidate. If we were allowed to pick him, apparently,\
  \ he would feature in every single episode and be voted Top Jesuit time and time\
  \ again. This seems to me a perfectly sensible outcome, which possibly explains\
  \ why I am not a television producer.\nStill, it didn't take me long to work out\
  \ who my second choice would be. It was Ninian MacNamara, who was the chaplain at\
  \ my school for the latter half of my time there. He couldn't hold a candle to Hopkins,\
  \ of course, but he was in his own way a quite magnificent Jesuit.\nIn spite of\
  \ the Irishry of his surname, Father MacNamara was a superbly English gent. He had\
  \ the look, and the manner, of the MP Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2014himself a Catholic\u2014\
  with the addition of a pair of rimless spectacles which lent him the air of a cartoon\
  \ Nazi villain from the films. His voice, though not quite as posh as \u201CVox\
  \ populi, vox Dei\u201D Rees-Mogg, was a fine and resounding instrument. It had\
  \ a tendency towards the high-pitched and declamatory, rather like Michael Palin's\
  \ voice in his \u201COh Lord, ooh you are so big\u201D sermon in The Meaning Of\
  \ Life.\nThough his chief concern was, no doubt, our immortal souls, most of his\
  \ energies were devoted to our cultural improvement. Father Ninian, you see, like\
  \ so many English Jesuits, was an intellectual. The only thing was, he did not seem\
  \ to know very much. However, ignorance did not stop him from enriching our little\
  \ brains, and I am thankful that, unlike Rita Byrne Tull's trainee teacher friend,\
  \ he never tried to convince us that the murderous psychopath Che Guevara was somehow\
  \ kin to Christ. I do not recall Father Ninian ever mentioning politics at all\u2014\
  or, indeed, Christ, come to that.\nHis great contribution, for the sixth formers,\
  \ was what I recall was dubbed the Culture Club. (I need hardly add that this was\
  \ in the days before Boy George was a household name.) This was a weekly after school\
  \ club where our chaplain would lead us in pursuits such as listening to classical\
  \ music, reciting poetry, and discussing art. My charge that he did not seem to\
  \ know much is based on one particular Club meeting, where he gave us a slide-show\
  \ of portraits of writers, whom we were then invited to identify. Father Ninian\
  \ didn't seem to recognise many of them himself\u2014though in retrospect perhaps\
  \ he was (very skilfully) dissembling for our benefit. If so, he was a damned good\
  \ actor.\nMy favourite session of the Culture Club, and one which is quite frankly\
  \ unforgettable, was when he asked us to choose our favourite poets. But we were\
  \ not asked to recite their poems\u2014being a natural performer, Father Ninian\
  \ took that duty on board himself. Now, this being the 1970s, there was of course\
  \ one earnest young sixth-former whose brain had been frazzled by too much Bob Dylan.\
  \ Before Sir Christopher Ricks and others took up the Dylan-as-great-poet baton,\
  \ my schoolmate was already there. Dylan, he opined, stood alongside Wordsworth\
  \ and Tennyson and all those dead fuddy-duddies, in fact he was probably the greatest\
  \ poet of this or any other age.\nFather Ninian, who was decisively unhip, seemed\
  \ mildly amused by this encomium. To his credit, however, he treated it with respect,\
  \ and, taking from my friend his well-thumbed and dog-eared copy of Writings And\
  \ Drawings (1973), he picked a lyric to recite to us. His choice fell on A Hard\
  \ Rain's Gonna Fall, and he proceeded to declaim it to us, the whole damn thing,\
  \ verses and chorus, very slowly and \u201Csignificantly\u201D, in that Michael\
  \ Palin voice. It was at the same time one of the funniest and most excruciating\
  \ episodes of my life. How I wish I'd had a concealed tape recorder!\nAfter leaving\
  \ school I never saw Father MacNamara again and, in truth, seldom gave him any thought.\
  \ Yet to this day I cannot listen to A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall without hearing his\
  \ voice and recalling my desperately stifled giggles. For that reason alone he is\
  \ a worthy candidate to be my favourite Jesuit, and if you watch the show, I hope\
  \ you will vote for him and make him, for twenty-four hours at least, Top Jesuit.\n\
