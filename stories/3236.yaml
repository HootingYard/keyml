text: "I am occasionally cajoled by well-meaning friends and readers to submit stories\
  \ to one of the legion of online literary magazines. I never do. No doubt, were\
  \ one of my pieces accepted, I would gain a marginal increase in readership, but\
  \ for some reason the idea of spreading like a rash over the interweb doesn't appeal.\
  \ I think, too, there are elements of diffidence and fastidiousness which make me\
  \ reluctant to seek editorial approval. Sheer idleness also plays its part, for\
  \ I am happy enough to allow publication on the rare occasions when an editor approaches\
  \ me, rather than vice versa.\nThis solipsistic drivel was prompted when I was pointed\
  \ towards The View From Here. One's first port of call is invariably the \u201C\
  about us\u201D or \u201Cguidelines for submissions\u201D bit. Now, I take an excessively\
  \ judgmental approach to these things. Is this, I ask myself, the kind of website\
  \ whose imprimatur I would value? Here is what The View From Here has to say for\
  \ itself:\n\u2026 we showcase the weird, unusual, thought provoking and occasionally\
  \ bizarre. We classify ourselves as \u201CBohemian Eclectic\u201D \u2014 yes, we\
  \ coined the term. Our stories will make you wonder, laugh, cry and generally FEEL\
  \ something. We expect to elicit a valid emotional response from our readers.\n\
  I make no comment on \u201CBohemian Eclectic\u201D nor on that peremptory use of\
  \ the upper case. But I can't help wondering what on earth is meant by a \u201C\
  valid\u201D emotional response. Here at Hooting Yard, we hope for an invalid response,\
  \ where invalid is a noun, with the stress on the first syllable. A correct invalid\
  \ response is the fey mopping of one's brow, the call for a bowl of pap and slops\
  \ in a weak and reedy voice, the groaning of the withered as a poultice or mustard\
  \ plaster is applied to one's pustules and buboes. Reading while shakily downing\
  \ a draught of Doctor Baxter's Invigorating Nerve Syrup is also encouraged.\nNOTE\_\
  : I should point out that The View From Here is by no means alone in announcing\
  \ itself in terms which find little favour with Mr Key. There are much worse examples\
  \ littered around the interweb.\n[2009-10-07]"
