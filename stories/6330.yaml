text: "\nLudicrously obsessed as I am by the Kennedy assassination, my current reading\
  \ is Vincent Bugliosi's Four Days In November (2007), an extraordinarily detailed\
  \ narrative of the events in Dallas forty-eight years ago. Bugliosi, famed as the\
  \ prosecutor in the Manson murders, has won great respect for his \u201Cprecise\
  \ and definitive\u201D account, \u201Cput[ting] all the pieces together\u201D, carefully\
  \ documenting his tale with thousands of footnotes referring to primary sources.\n\
  Yet here I am, on page 310, when we have arrived at 1.50 AM on Saturday 23 November,\
  \ and I am ready to toss the book across the room in exasperation. Why?\n\u201C\
  Most of Dallas is asleep when Ruby finally enters the KLIF building after Russ Knight\
  \ gets back from City Hall and opens the door. Several of the guys on duty are glad\
  \ to see Jack's big paper sack full of corned-beef sandwiches and soft drinks. \u201C\
  I figured you guys would be hungry,\u201D Jack tells them, \u201Cand I brought these\
  \ up for you.\u201D Knight and DJ Danny McCurdy were intrigued by Doctor Black's\
  \ celery tonic in its peculiarly shaped bottle and expensive-looking gold foil,\
  \ which neither of them had ever seen before. Whoever heard of a soft drink with\
  \ celery in it? Jack explains that it's something you normally get only in New York\
  \ and is especially pleased when McCurdy thinks it's the best soft drink he's ever\
  \ had.\u201D\nThere is, of course, no such drink as \u201CDoctor Black's celery\
  \ tonic\u201D. Bugliosi is confusing it with Doctor Brown's celery tonic, also known\
  \ as Cel-Ray. If he cannot get that right, if he muddles Black with Brown, how can\
  \ we trust anything he says in this bulky doorstop of a book? Such inaccurate flimflam\
  \ is enough to have me signing up to the absurd and paranoid Oliver Stone-Jim Garrison\
  \ theories about the case.\nMcCurdy may have asked \u201CWhoever heard of a soft\
  \ drink with celery in it?\u201D but a more pertinent question is surely \u201C\
  Whoever would have thought that a soft drink with celery in it would prove so crucial\
  \ a factor in the Kennedy assassination?\u201D\n[2011-04-03]"
