text: "Yesterday, I noted that Elspeth, a character in the soap opera These Plastic\
  \ Betrayals, was undone by foxgloves. This prompted a letter from Dr Ruth Pastry.\n\
  Dear Mijnheer Key, she writes, presuming me to be a Dutchman for reasons best known\
  \ to herself, I could not help noticing that in the latest episode of These Plastic\
  \ Betrayals, Elspeth is undone by foxgloves. Now, I yield to no one in the sheer\
  \ intensity of my admiration for your sure grasp of just about everything in the\
  \ known universe\u2014with the obvious exception of ornithology, of which you are\
  \ quite dramatically ignorant\u2014but I must confess as I read these words I spat\
  \ out my lukewarm vitamin-enhanced milk \u2018n\u2019 Lucozade pep drink, all over\
  \ the tablecloth, embroidered, as it so happens, with a design of foxgloves, by\
  \ the noted tablecloth designer Dot Foxglovecloth.\nCertain other details in the\
  \ episode, such as vinegar dusks, and stunned nightingales plummeting from rooftops,\
  \ have the unmistakeable stamp of verisimilitude, of actual phenomena in an actual\
  \ world actually occurring. But to be undone by foxgloves? Come, come, Mijnheer\
  \ Key, this strikes me, and I am sure many others, as a fancy born of an overheated\
  \ brain. I think you would be well advised to go and lie down in a darkened room\
  \ with a cold compress upon your forehead, and perhaps a cassette recording of sounds\
  \ designed to encourage relaxation, such as the songs of whales, the breeze rustling\
  \ through a clump of aspens, or Aleister Crowley invoking the Great God Pan.\nYours\
  \ more in sorrow than in actuality, Dr Ruth Pastry\nIt is always a pleasure to hear\
  \ from Dr Pastry, and I usually reread her letters several times before adding them\
  \ to the bundle, tied with pink ribbon, which I keep in a cardboard box underneath\
  \ my sink. On this occasion, however, I tossed the letter aside after a single reading,\
  \ and am minded to set fire to it later, after I have set out on my very own Quest\
  \ For Fire, babbling in an artificial primitive language devised by the late Mancunian\
  \ polymath Anthony Burgess.\nDr Pastry will, I hope, forgive me for asserting that\
  \ she has no idea what she is talking about, whereas I, as always, do. Unlike Dr\
  \ Pastry, I have scoured the literature, and found innumerable\u2014innumerable!\u2014\
  instances, particularly in soap operas, of characters being undone by foxgloves,\
  \ unhinged by petunias, and unmanned by primroses. I cannot actually provide any\
  \ concrete examples here and now, obviously, because I have far better things to\
  \ do with my time, such as going on a Quest For Fire, and eating my breakfast, and\
  \ gazing disconsolately out of the window at the crows on the lawn in the rain,\
  \ and it may well be that I have not really scoured the literature and not really\
  \ found any examples of floral undoing, or unhingement, or unmanning, whatever that\
  \ latter might mean, and my claim to have done so is but the product of an overheated\
  \ brain, but let us not forget that in the country of the Swiss roll, the roll is\
  \ Swiss.\nNow, if somebody will hand me a megaphone, I will shout my head off from\
  \ a vantage point on a promontory looking out over the vast wet hysterical sea,\
  \ and I shall frighten the fish and the dolphins and the plankton and the krill,\
  \ and I shall awake the Kraken!\n[2016-03-09]"
