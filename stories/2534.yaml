text: "\u201CLet the joy be unconfined!\u201D says Chris Cutler, with good reason.\
  \ For his ReR Megacorp has just released the second album by Vril, entitled The\
  \ Fatal Duckpond. Before we go any further, follow this link to buy your copy, immediately.\
  \ When you come back, read on.\nThe original trio of Cutler (drums), Lukas Simonis\
  \ (guitars), and Bob Drake (bass & guitars) is augmented this time by Pierre Omer\
  \ (guitars). Very sensibly, the puckish combo asked Mr Key to come up with the album\
  \ and track titles, and to contribute liner notes and illustrations. Here, as a\
  \ special treat for Hooting Yard readers, are those liner notes. It should be noted\
  \ that the emboldenment and italicisation of certain words were inserted by Mr Cutler,\
  \ or one of his minions, to excellent effect.\n\nThese notes are reproduced with\
  \ permission from Beekeepers Write About Compact Discs magazine (a weekly periodical).\n\
  As far as I can ascertain, the second album by the band VRIL has been made without\
  \ any bee involvement whatsoever. These eighteen new waxings by the group\u2014\
  now a quartet\u2014form the soundtrack to the European arthouse film classic The\
  \ Fatal Duckpond.. Seven hours long, black and white, and silent for large s t r\
  \ e t c h e s apart from these musical numbers and sparse patches of dialogue mumbled\
  \ in an incoherent and invented language, the film is a visionary reworking of the\
  \ 1956 Hollywood western The Bloodsoaked Revenge Of Escobar Beppo, itself an adaptation\
  \ of a rare and little-performed Jacobean drama whose author was stabbed to death\
  \ in a brawl and whose corpse was flung into the then stinking Thames.\nImportantly,\
  \ VRIL have based their \u201Cgroovy sounds\u201D\u2014I think that is the appropriate\
  \ term\u2014on all three sources. This does make it rather difficult to pinpoint\
  \ exactly which bit of the plot, or plots, is being evoked in each piece. To take\
  \ just one example, the fourth track, Baffling Calcium Lantern Light, could refer\
  \ equally well to the barnyard scene in the new film, the \u201CCasa Incognita\u201D\
  \ episode in the western, or indeed the bit in the Jacobean drama where the audience\
  \ always shuddered.\nMuch as it would be helpful to summarise the plot, of one or\
  \ all of the sources, it has to be said that it is a hopeless task. The original\
  \ Jacobean tragedy is a skein of untangleable knots, the western is dense and brooding,\
  \ and the latest film is frankly incoherent, in the best sense of the word. How\
  \ the director managed to pull the whole thing together without any bees or beekeepers\
  \ is a triumph, albeit a strange one.\nAh yes, the director. Rumour has it that\
  \ behind the person who appears in the (interminable) credits lurks the eerie figure\
  \ of Horst Gack. It was he who was really pulling the strings, he who took the play\
  \ and the western and decided to transform them into something quite unprecedented.\
  \ It is said that he pored over all known texts of the drama for over a decade,\
  \ and sat through thousands of screenings of the western, sometimes alone, and sometimes\
  \ accompanied by his mysterious wife and collaborator Primrose Dent. It may even\
  \ be that the whole thing is the brainchild of Primrose herself. Certainly it was\
  \ she who got VRIL on board to create the musical soundtrack. She tracked the band\
  \ down to a squalid cafeteria in Pointy Town, where they had been retained as the\
  \ regular afternoon entertainment. The cafeteria clientele, an intriguing jumble\
  \ of matelots, Jesuits, pin cushion sales reps, mountebanks, prestidigitators, and\u2014\
  yes\u2014beekeepers, were so distraught when they learned that Primrose planned\
  \ to whisk the band away to expensive rehearsal studios in a Swiss canton that they\
  \ rioted. Wily Primrose filmed the brouhaha and inserted the raw footage into the\
  \ finished version of The Fatal Duckpond. Unfortunately for us, she shot without\
  \ sound, so the band were unable to incorporate the din of shouting, thumping, smashing\
  \ and whatnot into the piece accompanying this section of the film.\nAll in all,\
  \ despite its perplexing beelessness, this is a tremendous album, even for those\
  \ who have never seen the film to which it acts as a soundtrack. And quite honestly,\
  \ the listener is probably better off not having to sit through hours of bad acting,\
  \ blurry visual effects, gruesome smudgy charcoal burnings, blank screens, hectoring\
  \ rants from unseen crew members, and still shots of daffodil-strewn fields.\nNOTE\_\
  : It occurs to me that newer readers may be unaware of the earlier Vril release,\
  \ Effigies In Cork. You will find an informative note about it here, but one of\
  \ the links appears to be out of date, so to buy your copy, go here.\n[2009-06-19]"
