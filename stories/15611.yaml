text: "Here is a scientific experiment which will intrigue and entertain everybody\
  \ from tiny tots to tottering crones. You will need to obtain a goodly amount of\
  \ curd, say about the size of a dinner plate. Divide the curd into two halves by\
  \ cutting it with a kitchen knife or, if you are feeling violent, which I know is\
  \ often the case, simply tear the curd in two with your bare hands. Et voila!, you\
  \ will now have two lumps of curd where once there was but one.\nDon't worry, that\
  \ was merely the preliminary, not the experiment itself. Now, you must treat the\
  \ lumps of curd in very different ways. The first lump, let us call it Curd A, must\
  \ be kept fresh at all costs. You could, for example, wrap it in clingfilm, which\
  \ is film that clings, and put it on a shelf in your refrigerator. Meanwhile, take\
  \ the other lump of curd and treat it as you would a piece of furniture you wanted\
  \ to give a fashionable \u201Cdistressed\u201D look. You can chuck the curd at the\
  \ wall, beat it with lengths of chain, leave it exposed to the elements for a week,\
  \ and so on.\nAt the end of this process, you will have two spectacularly different\
  \ lumps of curd. The one wrapped in clingfilm in the refrigerator will be as good\
  \ as new, whereas the other one, which I forgot to call Curd B earlier, will look\
  \ old and wretched and like something the cat dragged in. (If the cat does indeed\
  \ drag it in, while it is outside exposed to the elements, take it back outside\
  \ and scold the cat.)\nI now want you to take both lumps of curd to the nearest\
  \ duckpond. With all the vim you can muster, chuck them into the pond or, as it\
  \ might say in the Bible, cast the curds upon the waters. Now watch in amazement\
  \ as Curd A, the fresh, good as new curd, floats, while Curd B, the old, wretched\
  \ curd, sinks to the bottom.\nWhy does this happen? Well, I'm not going to tell\
  \ you. But one person who knows the answer has written an entire book about it.\
  \ Her name is Maya Angelou and the book, as I recall, is entitled I Know Why The\
  \ Aged Curd Sinks.\n[2017-09-06]"
