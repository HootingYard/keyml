text: "Tribulations Of The Buttonmaker is an opera by the French-Aboriginal Australian\
  \ composer Di G\xE9ridu. It has not been performed since the early 19th century,\
  \ possibly because of its vast cast, loopy libretto, and/or musical pomposity.\n\
  In Act One, Fulgencio the buttonmaker is beset by tribulations. He is attacked by\
  \ an angry spider. His hat is blown off in a high wind. He chokes on a gobstopper.\
  \ One of his buttons falls down a drain. He is excommunicated by the Pope. Brutes\
  \ break both his arms. The weft of his tunic is in disarray. His villa is infested\
  \ by peewits. He contracts a dangerous ague. Mice nibble his bootlaces. Another\
  \ of his buttons falls down a different drain. His bowl of plums is poisoned. Malign\
  \ sprites with pitchforks torment him in his sleep. The rent on his palazzo is increased.\
  \ He is hoist by his own petard. Then he is hoist by several other people's petards.\
  \ He is followed everywhere he goes by a rancorous chicken. He develops an allergy\
  \ to spinach. He accidentally drops another button down another drain. The earth\
  \ trembles. The stars are blotted out. The sky falls down\nAct One closes with Fulgencio\
  \ singing the monotonous dirge \u201CO! Woe unto me for I have been attacked by\
  \ an angry spider and my hat was blown off in a high wind and I choked on a gobstopper\
  \ and one of my buttons fell down a drain and I was excommunicated by the Pope and\
  \ brutes broke both my arms and the weft of my tunic was in disarray and my villa\
  \ was infested by peewits and I contracted a dangerous ague and mice nibbled my\
  \ bootlaces and another of my buttons fell down a different drain and my bowl of\
  \ plums was poisoned and malign sprites with pitchforks tormented me in my sleep\
  \ and the rent on my palazzo was increased and I was hoist by my own petard and\
  \ then I was hoist by several other people's petards and I was followed everywhere\
  \ I went by a rancorous chicken and I developed an allergy to spinach and I accidentally\
  \ dropped another button down another drain and the earth trembled and the stars\
  \ were blotted out and the sky fell down and I'm feeling so lonesome I could die\u201D\
  .\nIn Acts Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve,\
  \ Thirteen and Fourteen Fulgencio the buttonmaker suffers further tribulations,\
  \ until, as the curtain falls, the stage is littered with corpses and the angry\
  \ spider scuttles off, stage right.\n[2016-01-24]"
