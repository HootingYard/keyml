text: "For reasons too convoluted for my puny pea-sized brain to comprehend, I found\
  \ myself the other day embarking on a spot of research into the Norwegian writer\
  \ Alf Pr\xF8ysen (1914\u20141970). He is best known for his tales of Little Old\
  \ Mrs Pepperpot, a woman who every so often shrinks to the size of a small teaspoon,\
  \ which explains her original Norwegian name of Teskjekjerringa, or the teaspoon\
  \ lady. In looking through a list of pot-spoon-woman stories, I was struck particularly\
  \ by the one entitled Mrs Pepperpot Buys Macaroni.\nIt is worth noting here that,\
  \ if ever one were stupid enough to trust the Wikipedia, this is a perfect example\
  \ of its unreliability. As any fule kno, the true title of the tale is Mr Pepperpot\
  \ Buys Macaroni.\nBe that as it may, Mr or Mrs, the important thing is that Pr\xF8\
  ysen, wittingly or not, invented a completely new fictional genre, the \u201Cbuying\
  \ macaroni\u201D story. In the years since Mr Pepperpot, or Mr Teaspoon or whatever\
  \ his name is, went out and bought that macaroni, it is a theme which dozens, if\
  \ not hundreds, of creative artists have found rich and rewarding. Novels, plays,\
  \ films, ballets, operas, opera bouffes, art installations cobbled together from\
  \ grainy black-and-white video tapes and coathangers, all have been grist to the\
  \ buying-macaroni-artist's mill. Bloody hell, even the greatest visual artist of\
  \ this or any other generation, Steve McQueen, is said to be following the most\
  \ brilliant film ever made by anybody anywhere, 12 Years A Slave, with an even more\
  \ brilliant film, 12 Years Buying Macaroni. And not only that, but McQueen is paying\
  \ homage to Pr\xF8ysen by casting in the lead role the greatest musical genius of\
  \ our times, Tinie Tempah. Mr Tempah is reportedly as tiny as Mrs Pepperpot during\
  \ her teaspoon-shrinkage phases. At least that is my understanding.\nA poor scribbler\
  \ such as myself cannot, of course, hope to compete with these titanic geniuses,\
  \ but in my own tiny way I hope to make a modest contribution to the genre with\
  \ a piece called Dobson Buys Macaroni. I have already refilled my propelling pencil\
  \ in preparation.\n\nAlf Pr\xF8ysen performing one of his timeless macaroni-buying\
  \ songs\n[2014-01-19]"
