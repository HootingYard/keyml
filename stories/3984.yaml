text: "Bonkers Maisie in her cart, trundling past the madhouse wall. Has she read\
  \ The Intellectual Part by author Rayner Heppenstall? Yes she has, a hundred times,\
  \ it is the only book she owns. She can act it out in mimes while juggling several\
  \ traffic cones. She trundles \u2018long the rutted lane, heading for the distant\
  \ sea. Sprites cavort within her brain, a brain no bigger than a bee. Dainty is\
  \ her air and mien, though her cap is set askew. She is in love with Lothar Preen,\
  \ the maestro. He is bonkers too.\nBy the sea they shall be wed, then sail away\
  \ in a barquentine. Hearts of tin, hearts of lead, they shall yearn and they shall\
  \ pine for the land o\u2019 pomposity they have quit, where Mrs Gubbins'll sit and\
  \ knit commemorative tea cosies by the score, for Preen and Maisie, on the shore,\
  \ like King Canute upon the beach. In the squall huge seabirds screech.\nThe cart's\
  \ abandoned. It will rot. There's a moral lesson there, is there not?\n[2010-02-25]"
