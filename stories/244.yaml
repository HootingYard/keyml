text: "Joost Van Dongelbraacke's peppery constitution is the subject of not one, not\
  \ two, but three new publications, a book, a pamphlet, and a monthly magazine. One\
  \ might think that the constitution of a suburban shaman is too thin a topic to\
  \ support a regular periodical, particularly such a fat and glossy one, but that\
  \ is to discount the monomania of its editor, Tilly Whelkstallholder. Tilly is a\
  \ woman of considerable intellectual energy. Early in life, her ambition was to\
  \ become, like Eva Crane, a pivotal figure in the world of beekeeping for half a\
  \ century, but she had to abandon this plan when it became clear that, try as she\
  \ might, she simply could not get her head around the difference between bees, wasps\
  \ and hornets. She would stare for hours at photographs, or illustrations, or dead\
  \ bees, wasps and hornets suspended in aspic or a similar jelly, but all that happened\
  \ was that her brain became a fuddled and fuming thing, and she had to go to the\
  \ canteen at Hubermann's department store for a reviving cup of tea.\nIt was over\
  \ one such refreshment that she first encountered the name Joost Van Dongelbraacke.\
  \ The suburban shaman had been invited to respond to a Q & A in that week's issue\
  \ of Dashed Beekeeping Ambitions magazine, and Tilly found some of his answers fascinating.\
  \ For example, asked who he would invite to his ideal dinner party, Van Dongelbraacke\
  \ listed Jack and Bobby Charlton, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Jack Teagarden, Bobby\
  \ Previte, and Eva Crane, among some two hundred guests. In response to the question\
  \ \u201CO Joost, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201D, he reportedly answered with a\
  \ stream of heavily sub-edited invective. What really took Tilly's fancy, though,\
  \ was the revelation that Van Dongelbraacke had a peppery constitution. Downing\
  \ what remained of her cup of tea, she hurried out of the canteen, popped in to\
  \ a kiosk to buy a bus ticket and a carton of expensive Paraguayan cigarettes, and\
  \ dawdled impatiently at the bus shelter until the number 5724938 arrived. Settling\
  \ herself in the seat just behind the driver, she plotted the first edition of Joost\
  \ Van Dongelbraacke's Peppery Constitution Monthly Magazine as the bus juddered\
  \ along the muddy lane out of town, past the swimming pool and the heron enclosure,\
  \ down through the big frightening tunnel and out onto the sycamore- and lupin-lined\
  \ highway, picking up speed as it screeched through villages named after French\
  \ film directors, swerved off towards the Blister Lane Bypass, then thundered inexorably\
  \ downhill parallel with the derelict funicular railway until it reached the bus\
  \ depot on the outskirts of the tiny and gruesome fishing village where Tilly rented\
  \ half a barn during the summer months. It was winter, so she had no key, and had\
  \ to clamber in though a funnel at the back of the other half of the barn and then\
  \ smash down the connecting door with an axe. A week later, the first issue of her\
  \ magazine appeared on the shelves of Old Ma Purgative's pie shop and newsagent's.\n\
  It sold out within minutes, for the grubby fisherfolk of the village had a seemingly\
  \ unquenchable enthusiasm for the work of Simon Schama and, ever canny, Tilly had\
  \ persuaded the historian to contribute a cover story. Schama had never even heard\
  \ of Van Dongelbraacke, but Tilly had given him free rein to write whatever he liked,\
  \ and then edited the piece by inserting the suburban shaman's name, and references\
  \ to his peppery constitution, at whim. If Simon Schama complained, she reasoned,\
  \ the threat of her axe to his spectacles would silence him. As we have seen, Tilly\
  \ was a dab hand with that axe of hers.\nAnother reason for the sales blitz was\
  \ that Tilly gave away one of Old Ma Purgative's homemade celery and beetroot pies\
  \ with each copy of the first issue. Now, the Old Ma was as tight-fisted a crone\
  \ as you could imagine, and Tilly had to pay for every single pie out of her own\
  \ pocket. Having spent the last florin of her offshore hedge fund to produce the\
  \ magazine, and as ignorant of complex financial instruments as she was of the difference\
  \ between bees and wasps and hornets, Tilly was forced to go to her bank manager\
  \ to beg for a loan. Like the emptied hedge fund, her bank was based offshore for\
  \ legal, or possibly criminal, reasons, and the scuppered trawler in the cabin of\
  \ which the bank manager held court like a latterday Neptune was a day's hard rowing\
  \ out at sea. By dint of an oar mishap, Tilly's little boat ran aground on Scroonhoonpooge\
  \ Sands, invariably described as \u201Ctreacherous\u201D by those in the maritime\
  \ know. She wasted a precious week living off rainwater and eels until rescued by\
  \ a floating zoo. By chance, the zookeeper captain was both the uncle of the bank\
  \ manager and a lifelong devotee of Joost Van Dongelbraacke, and he gave Tilly a\
  \ handful of cash to buy sufficient pies from Old Ma Purgative. It is a minor tragedy\
  \ that Tilly never spoke to the captain about her dashed beekeeping ambitions, for\
  \ by a further eerie coincidence, this polymathic nautical zookeeper had, some years\
  \ past, devised a completely idiot-proof method for telling apart bees and wasps\
  \ and hornets, which even Tilly might have understood.\nAll that was a few months\
  \ ago, and even though there are no more free pies, and Simon Schama has refused\
  \ ever to write for it again, Tilly's magazine continues to befuddle those marketing\
  \ experts who predicted ruin. It is now on sale not only in Old Ma Purgative's pie\
  \ shop and newsagent's, but also in Hubermann's, and copies can be consulted in\
  \ the Library of Congress, although Tilly becomes tight-lipped when asked precisely\
  \ which Library of which Congress, and some suspect she may be referrring to a cupboard\
  \ belonging to the Pang Hill Butchers\u2019 Shops Trade Association.\nI began by\
  \ saying that Tilly's magazine was one of three new publications devoted to Joost\
  \ Van Dongelbraacke's peppery constitution, the others being a book and a pamphlet.\
  \ I realise now that I misread an item in the latest newsletter from the Pang Hill\
  \ Butchers\u2019 Shops Trade Association, and that neither the book nor the pamphlet\
  \ exist. I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick and tired of irresponsible\
  \ butchers peddling falsehoods or ambiguities in their trade publications. And don't\
  \ get me started on grocers, fishmongers, and pastry shop proprietors. It's time\
  \ something was done. Start writing your placards!\n[2007-10-06]"
