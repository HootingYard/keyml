text: "A while back, in his Ragbag, Gaw posted an excerpt from David Kynaston's book\
  \ Family Britain 1951\u20131957 recalling inhabitants of a lost world, variety acts\
  \ of the time including mental telepathists the Piddingtons and Valantyne Napier\
  \ the human spider. Lost indeed, but that trace of them survives, both in Kynaston's\
  \ book and, duly quoted by Gaw, on het internet. Imagine how pleased you would be,\
  \ as one of a younger generation of Piddingtons, to do a Google search and find\
  \ your grandparents or great-grandparents (and so on, yea unto the last generation)\
  \ remembered, even in so tantalisingly vague a fashion.\nBut what of those who vanish\
  \ utterly from memory? I thought, perhaps naively, that everything could be found\
  \ on het internet, somewhere or other, hidden in some cobwebbed corner. This morning,\
  \ in The Naked Lady, or Storm Over Adah\_: A Biography Of Adah Isaacs Menken by\
  \ Bernard Falk, I came upon this:\n\u201CTed Volta, the famous clown, happily still\
  \ alive in the winter of 1933\u201334, remembers how he, and the young men of his\
  \ day, rushed over Westminster Bridge to be shown the bold hussy, whose surprising\
  \ dress was said to be that of Mother Eve.\u201D\nFalk's book was published in 1934,\
  \ when the aged Ted Volta could still be described as \u201Cthe famous clown\u201D\
  . Intrigued by that splendid name, I looked him up online but could find not a trace\
  \ of him anywhere. Not a trace. And The Naked Lady is out of print. So will Ted\
  \ Volta be completely forgotten? Or, by tapping out that quotation, have I singlehandedly\
  \ rescued him from oblivion?\nIt is my hope that one day a historian of clowns will\
  \ stumble upon this postage, and set off in pursuit of Ted Volta, and, after months\
  \ and years of tireless research, produce a thumping great biography in book form,\
  \ and a website dedicated to the famous, not forgotten, clown.\n[2010-08-17]"
