  \ simple rules of conduct for prancing through a complicated world with elegance\
  \ and brio. Mr Key is, of course, far too ignorant to be able to cobble together\
  \ any such rules himself, so he will rely on the tried and tested wisdom of others.\
  \ And to begin with, we have this unarguable rule to live by:\nNever, ever question\
  \ Higgins\u2019 safety nous.\nMake of that what you will, but bear in mind the awful\
  \ fate of the last person who dared to question Higgins\u2019 safety nous. Thereby\
  \ hangs a tale to curdle the stomach and derange the collywobbles.\n[2010-04-24]"
