text: 'Here are simple instructions to achieve that state of being where the boot
  is on the other foot.

  Let us assume you are a biped, of the kind known as a pauper biped. Your pauperdom
  affords you but one boot. In the normal run of things, during your waking hours
  when you are out and about begging for alms, you will have one foot shod in the
  boot and the other bare, or perhaps ensocked, or partly wrapped in trailing straggles
  of puttee.

  It is best to carry out the following manoeuvres in front of a mirror, so you can
  see what you are doing. Let us say the boot is on your right foot. In the mirror,
  it will look as if it is on your left foot, but a moment''s reflection, ho ho, should
  suffice to confirm it is on your right.

  Now, sit on a clump. Lean over and, taking the boot in both hands, prise it off
  your foot. You may wish to avert the nasal passages as you do so. If the now unbooted
  foot is bare, it is a good idea at this point to transfer on to it the sock or ragged
  scraps of puttee from the other, left, foot, which will appear to you in the mirror
  as the right. You can also go and dip it, the right foot, into a nearby rill or
  stream. Keep an eye on your boot as you do so, however, for the land is riddled
  with brigands who might make off with your boot while you are incommoded with one
  foot in running water.

  Back on the clump, jam your left foot, the right one in the mirror, remember, into
  the boot. Stand up. The boot is now on the other foot, compared to where it was
  before you started.

  It is worth noting that this is a pastime the pauper can enjoy with much more ease
  than the rich man. When there is only the one boot, as with the pauper, it is child''s
  play to keep track of what you are doing. The rich man, possessed of many boots,
  and many mirrors, can often become hopelessly confused by the manoeuvres, and fly
  into a rage, throwing boots about his palace and inadvertently smashing mirrors.
