  and second, sees ResonanceFM''s fundraising marathon. From noon to midnight on Saturday
  and Sunday a series of guests will be trooping into the studios offering delectable
  items to be snapped up in live auctions.

  Mr Key will be on air between 1.30 and 2.00 PM on Sunday, eliciting bids for a pair
  of uberrarities, the books Derek The Dust Particle and Bring Me The Head Of Derek
  The Dust Particle!, written by Perry Natal and illustrated by Frank Key, published
  two decades ago by Indelible Inc.

  So turn on, tune in, drop what you''re doing, and bid as if your life depends on
  it. Resonance needs you, almost as much as you need Resonance.
