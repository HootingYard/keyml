  \ reportage on the remarkable \u201CKrakatoa sunsets\u201D of 1883.\naccording to\
  \ my observation, the ground of the sky in the east was green or else tawny, and\
  \ the crimson only in the clouds. A great sheet of heavy dark cloud, with a reefed\
  \ or puckered make, drew off the west in the course of the pageant: the edge of\
  \ this and the smaller pellets of cloud that filed across the bright field of the\
  \ sundown caught a livid green.\n[2012-05-29]"
