  \ appeared on this day eight years ago.\nDobson lived in the era before mobile phones,\
  \ of course, so when he found himself imperilled in an isolated spot he had to harness\
  \ every last scrap of ingenuity to summon help. You or I would simply make a call\
  \ on our mobile\u2014well, you would, but I wouldn't, because I do not own a mobile\
  \ phone and never shall, for they are an abomination unto me\u2014but this was not\
  \ an option for Dobson, so what did he do?\nLet us take a closer look at the circumstances.\
  \ It was a Tuesday in February. Football fans were grieving the loss of the Busby\
  \ Babes in the Munich Air Disaster, Pope Pius XII had declared that Saint Clare\
  \ was to be the patron saint of television, and little blind David Blunkett was\
  \ just eleven years old. Meanwhile, Dobson got lost on an ill-advised hiking expedition\
  \ and found himself exhausted, in a spinney, menaced by feral goats. The out of\
  \ print pamphleteer had also managed to get himself hopelessly entangled in a thicket\
  \ of thorny brambly creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles.\
  \ That's the kind of spinney it was, at least twenty miles from the nearest village,\
  \ and with no paths nor country lanes leading anywhere close to it. There was, it\
  \ is true, a big pylon a couple of dozen yards away, but it was a lone pylon, unconnected\
  \ to any kind of electrical grid or other wiring system, a pylon the purpose of\
  \ which was unknown, and it was a pylon of rust, suggestive of abandonment and disuse.\n\
  This was not the first time Dobson had been in a hiking pickle, and it would not\
  \ be the last. Indeed, late in life he had enough material to furnish a pamphlet\
  \ entitled An Anthology Of Disastrous Hiking Mishaps Cobbled Together From A Lifetime\
  \ Of Ill-Starred Rustic Pursuits (out of print). What was significant about this\
  \ particular pickle was the manner in which Dobson succeeded in extricating himself\
  \ from it.\nThis was the period during which he had joined an experimental knitting\
  \ circle, and as luck would have it he had in his noddy bag that day his latest\
  \ project. It was an interpretation, in wool, of The Wreck Of The Deutschland by\
  \ Gerard Manley Hopkins. Dobson realised that, when fully unravelled, the yarn would\
  \ stretch for miles. He sat down in the brambles, lit his pipe, took the scrunched-up\
  \ woollen masterpiece out of his noddy bag, and unravelled, unravelled, unravelled.\
  \ Two hours later he was still unravelling. The sun was setting by the time he was\
  \ done, but Dobson had no fear of the night, for he was sanguine.\nFrequently Asked\
  \ Question\_: Why didn't the pamphleteer use his portable metal tapping machine\
  \ to call for help?\nAnswer\_: He was unable to use his portable metal tapping machine\
  \ because there was no ground-level pneumatic hub within reach.\nThe wool fully\
  \ unravelled, Dobson tapped out his pipe on a stone and beckoned to one of the feral\
  \ Toggenbergs. The goats were still gathered in a gang on the edge of the spinney,\
  \ and it is a mystery why they had not attacked the bramble-trapped pamphleteer.\
  \ In the Anthology, Dobson suggested that a combination of acrid pipe smoke, unravelled\
  \ wool, and his sanguine nature had deterred the goats, but it seems that for once\
  \ he was being modest. Almost certainly, the decisive factor was Dobson's eerie\
  \ ability to mesmerise goats, especially Toggenbergs. It is a skill which has not\
  \ been much remarked upon, possibly because Dobson himself made light of it, and\u2014\
  curiously\u2014never devoted a pamphlet to it. But he had been practising goat mesmerisation\
  \ since he was a babe in arms, and now his expertise paid off. Beckoning a Toggenberg,\
  \ as I said, Dobson tied one end of the length of wool around one of its Satanic\
  \ horns, then whispered goat-language into its ear. We do not know what he said,\
  \ but presumably it was something like \u201CScamper away, goat, in a straight line,\
  \ and do not stop until you reach a village\u201D.\nIt was not a village that the\
  \ goat scampered to, however. Three hours after being entranced, it came to a wire\
  \ fence, chewed its way through, and, in so doing, set off a hideous caterwauling\
  \ alarm system. The night was filled with noise, and the Toggenberg was caught in\
  \ the white glare of a Kleig light. Within seconds, it was surrounded by a clomping\
  \ troop of visored commandos armed with Simon & Garfunkel rifles. Inadvertently,\
  \ the mesmerised capricorn had stumbled into a top secret military intelligence\
  \ compound. A commando with a captain's badge bundled the goat onto a bauxite cradle\
  \ chained to a winch, while a second commando, this one with a cadet's badge, untied\
  \ the wool from its horn.\nMiles away, Dobson was smoking his pipe and lackadaisically\
  \ paying out the wool, hand over hand. Suddenly, he felt it jerk, and held on tight.\
  \ And then he was yanked free of the thorny brambly creeping greenery rife with\
  \ puffy spiders and venomous beetles and dragged across a wasteland of fields and\
  \ gravel pits and sumps and countryside filth until he fetched up at the feet of\
  \ the commandos who reeled him in, just as midnight struck.\nThat is how Dobson\
  \ got out of a hiking pickle, only to find himself in a very alarming dilemma indeed,\
  \ slap bang in the middle of a military intelligence compound that was top secret\
  \ for very good reasons\u2014reasons which, even at a distance of fifty years, I\
  \ am far too terrified to divulge. He was placed in a holding cell with the feral\
  \ goat and interrogated at length. The wool was returned to him and he asked for,\
  \ and was given, a pair of knitting needles. Between interrogations he was able\
  \ to re-knit The Wreck Of The Deutschland, although much of his woollen reimagining\
  \ of the lines about the Tall Nun was gnawed into scritty by the Toggenberg. By\
  \ the time the commandos released the pamphleteer, having scrambled his brainpans\
  \ so thoroughly that he remembered nothing after the spinney, Richard Milhous Nixon\
  \ had published his book Six Crises, Pluto and Neptune were in alignment for the\
  \ first time in 403 years, and little blind David Blunkett was no longer so little.\n\
  Dobson returned home even more sanguine than before the hiking pickle. As for the\
  \ feral goat, it stayed with the commandos. They adopted it as a pet, and called\
  \ it Flopsy.\n[2015-02-19]"
