text: "Soup-in-the-beard was a condition which affected many Victorian gentlemen possessed\
  \ of disgusting table manners. It commonly took the form of patches of beard hair\
  \ becoming soaked in spilled soup, which then dried out, causing the hairs to become\
  \ matted and malodorous. The spillage would usually occur at the point where the\
  \ Victorian gentleman, wielding a spoonful of soup and aiming to transfer the full\
  \ amount into his mouth, would fall at the last hurdle, and send some or all of\
  \ the spoonful dribbling down his beard. If the bowl of soup was a generous one,\
  \ as it often was at Victorian banquets, repetitions of this manoeuvre could result\
  \ in the beard being absolutely drenched, with droplets of the spilled soup dripping\
  \ on to the elegantly embroidered tablecloth.\nAlthough we do not have precise figures,\
  \ it is believed that a significant proportion of cases of soup-in-the-beard were\
  \ caused by uncontrollable tremors of the hand, symptoms of withdrawal from the\
  \ gargantuan doses of opium favoured by almost all Victorian gentlemen. This does\
  \ not, of course, excuse their disgusting table manners, which were disgusting,\
  \ almost as disgusting as\u2014at another time, in another place\u2014those of Franz\
  \ Kafka.\nContemporary written accounts of soup-in-the-beard are surprisingly few,\
  \ possibly because it was so prevalent, so much a commonplace, that chroniclers\
  \ of the time did not consider it worthy of remark. A vivid exception is contained\
  \ in a letter written by the Dowager Duchess Dipsy of Poxhaven, dated 14 January\
  \ 1868:\nLast night I attended a dinner to raise funds for the Society for the Promotion\
  \ of Sending Working Class Orphans Down Mineshafts, held at Soot-Blackened House.\
  \ I was seated next to Walter Mad, whose beard is prodigious. The poor man's hands\
  \ were shaking badly, and he confessed to me that he had not had a dose of opium\
  \ for a full half hour. During the soup course\u2014mulligatawny, to my horror\u2014\
  Walter Mad had a great deal of difficulty transferring the soup from bowl to mouth\
  \ by means of a spoon, and after a minute or two his beard was sopping wet, almost\
  \ more soup than hair. I was amused to note that he summoned his valet, who proceeded\
  \ to wring out the beard, much like a janitor with a mop. Cleverly, Walter Mad commanded\
  \ him to do this directly over the bowl, so that the soup in the beard replenished\
  \ the soup in the bowl. By this means, and by several further wringings-out, Walter\
  \ Mad was still busy with his soup while the rest of us had moved on to the jugged\
  \ hare and the strangled weasel. His table manners are disgusting, but he gave ten\
  \ shillings to send urchins from the lower orders down the mines, so his cold black\
  \ heart is in the right place.\nNext week\_: Egg-On-The-Waistcoat.\n[2016-02-09]"
