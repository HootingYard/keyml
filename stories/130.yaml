text: "Astute readers, and fanatical Dobsonists, will have noticed that yesterday\
  \ was the first post-free day since Hooting Yard was relaunched at the beginning\
  \ of February. The reasons for this are twofold.\n1. I have a stinking cold, and\
  \ am much dependent on Lemsip, which readers will recall is the favoured tipple\
  \ of our poet laureate Andrew Motion. In fact, I have taken to calling it Motion\
  \ Potion. In theory, sufficient draughts of this piping hot medicament ought to\
  \ inspire me to write poetry, just as happens with Mr M. Alas, I seem to be immune.\n\
  2. When not whimpering and snuffling and weakly calling aidez-moi! (see Bulle Ogier\
  \ in Celine & Julie Go Boating, my role model when ill) I am concentrating on a\
  \ couple of other projects which will be of interest to readers. The follow-up to\
  \ Befuddled By Cormorants is now in preparation. Unspeakable Desolation Pouring\
  \ Down From The Stars will include the novella-length title story and two other\
  \ pieces, together with some charming drawings of postage stamps. In addition, I\
  \ have been struck by the success of the auctions of ancient Key works in raising\
  \ hundreds of pounds for ResonanceFM, and have been digging around in the Archives\
  \ (ie, a couple of cardboard boxes in a cupboard) to see what other material might\
  \ be made available to people with both money and sense. Watch this space for the\
  \ imminent announcement of Hooting Yard Auction Number One, likely to feature original\
  \ artwork.\nNOTE\_: The current Resonance fundraising auction has been moved to\
  \ eBay. You can place bids for copies of The Brink Of Cramp and House Of Turps.\n\
  UPDATE\_: At the end of bidding, these two titles between them raised \xA3199 for\
  \ Resonance. Thank you to the successful bidders.\n[2007-03-21]"
