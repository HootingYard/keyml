text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Olivia Funnel, Perhaps I am thick. Or perhaps, by dint\
  \ of my airy-fairy upbringing on a hippy commune, I do not possess a criminal's\
  \ imagination. Whatever the reason, I am utterly in the dark regarding the way in\
  \ which otters in a laundry basket could prove a pivotal element in a heist. I must\
  \ confess I have not seen the film Snakes On A Plane, which may put me at a disadvantage,\
  \ but I did see, more than once, Krzysztof Kie\u015Blowski's A Short Film About\
  \ Killing Snakes On A Plane, upon which I understand the box office hit was based.\
  \ In fact, after reading your piece, I watched the Kie\u015Blowski again on DVD,\
  \ hoping to understand a little more about the fourth bungled heist. I am none the\
  \ wiser, although I did get a mild frisson from watching a DVD starring the man\
  \ after whom the technology is named, Dick Van Dyke. Were you aware, incidentally,\
  \ that the veteran chim-chim-cheroo singer receives a royalty payment for every\
  \ DVD sold, even pirated ones foisted on you by street corner urchins? Anyway, as\
  \ I say, even watching the film again I was unable to grasp the role of a laundry\
  \ basket full of otters in a criminal enterprise. Could you perhaps enlighten me,\
  \ and those others of your readers who grew up on hippy communes and thus do not\
  \ have a criminal bone in their bodies?\nDear Ms Funnel, replies Mr Key, First of\
  \ all I wish to take issue with your assertion that children raised on hippy communes\
  \ lack any instinct for rascality and crime. Just because you spent your childhood\
  \ talking to elves and fairies and communing with tree spirits does not mean that\
  \ in adulthood you are incapable of committing heinous and unforgivable crimes.\
  \ Always remember that there is a notorious serial killer called Sunflower Buttercup.\
  \ Secondly, while you might enjoy the grim eurotosh of Kie\u015Blowski films, the\
  \ great Dick Van Dyke is probably seen to better effect in an unashamedly populist\
  \ entertainment such as Tod Baxter's Three Colours\_: Beige, the kind of film you\
  \ probably sneer at. And finally, were you half way literate and had read the Sherlock\
  \ Holmes story The Strange Affair Of The Weasels In A Laundry Hamper, you would\
  \ know precisely what the plan was for the fourth bungled heist, and would not need\
  \ to write foolish letters to Hooting Yard.\n[2009-08-09]"
