text: "\u201CAntoinette Bourignon, that extraordinary mystic of the seventeenth century,\
  \ had some strange visions of the primeval man and the birth of Eve. The body of\
  \ Adam, she says, was more pure, translucent, and transparent than crystal, light\
  \ and buoyant as air. In it were vessels and streams of light, which entered and\
  \ exuded through the pores. The vessels were charged with liquors of various colours\
  \ of intense brilliancy and transparency; some of these fluids were water, milk,\
  \ wine, fire, &c. Every motion of Adam's body produced ineffable harmonies. Every\
  \ creature obeyed him; nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men\
  \ of this time; his hair was short, curled, and approaching to black. He had a little\
  \ down on his lower lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid, like water in a crystal\
  \ bowl, in which tiny eggs developed themselves, like bubbles in wine, as he glowed\
  \ with the ardour of Divine charity; and when he strongly desired that others should\
  \ unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of these eggs, which hatched,\
  \ and from one of them emerged his consort, Eve.\u201D\nSabine Baring-Gould, Curiosities\
