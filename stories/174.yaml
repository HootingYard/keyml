text: "I have received in the post what can only be described as a screed from Madame\
  \ Boubou, who describes herself as a \u201Cmystic channeler\u201D.\nDear Mr Key,\
  \ she writes, I was in my kitchen boiling an enormous pan of rhubarb when I was\
  \ of a sudden engulfed by wisps of ectoplasm and a voice spoke to me from the Other\
  \ Side. Please note that this is the same place you describe as the ethereal realm\
  \ in your piece entitled Annals Of The Frankish Kings, or at least I strongly suspect\
  \ it is. Of course there are many realms, oh many many many, and we have cognisance\
  \ of a mere handful. The vast majority of people are only familiar with the one\
  \ realm, this earthly one, but I am a mystic channeler and thus have access to more\
  \ realms than I can shake a stick at, the ethereal realm, or Other Side, being one\
  \ of them. What happens is that the spirit beings who languish there sometimes find\
  \ themselves impelled to send messages to those of us in this solid world of concrete\
  \ and cement and soil and pebbles and clods. It is no easy matter to breach the\
  \ awful chasm that divides us, and that's where I come in. Even when I am puttering\
  \ about engaged in workaday activities such as boiling up an enormous pan of rhubarb,\
  \ my channels remain open.\nI would explain further but I suspect your puny brain\
  \ would be incapable of grasping the eldritch nature of my gift. As that wag H P\
  \ Lovecraft put it, \u201Cthe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the\
  \ inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents\u201D. I can vouch for\
  \ that. Anyway, all this is by way of preamble to the marrow of my message, which\
  \ is that I have to pass on to you a complaint. As the ectoplasm wafted around me,\
  \ I became aware of a voice being channelled through the mystic Aether. You may\
  \ not be surprised to learn that it was the voice of Pippin the Short, of whom you\
  \ wrote in the aforementioned Annals Of The Frankish Kings. Here is what he said,\
  \ faithfully recorded using my Pencil of the Paranormal, which, as luck would have\
  \ it, I had sharpened under a zinc and copper pyramid just before putting the rhubarb\
  \ on the boil. I have omitted the hideous guttural gurgling noises which began this\
  \ mystic communication, but otherwise give it verbatim:\nO Madame Boubou! You must\
  \ pass on a complaint to a place called Hooting Yard. It must be known that I am\
  \ not a Frankish king short of stature. \u201CPippin the Short\u201D is a mistranslation\
  \ of \u201CPepin le bref\u201D. I should rightly be known as Pippin or Pepin the\
  \ Younger, for I have an older brother named Carloman. That is all that is meant.\
  \ You cannot imagine how fed up I am of being thought a diminutive king when in\
  \ fact I am a king of average height. Please make sure this misunderstanding is\
  \ corrected tout suite, or I may have to consider litigation, which can get frightfully\
  \ complex in this ethereal realm. Enjoy your rhubarb.\nAfter what sounded like a\
  \ choking sob, the voice grew silent and the ectoplasm dispersed. I was about to\
  \ stir my enormous pot of boiling rhubarb when another voice crashed in from the\
  \ Beyond. This time it was houri-eyed siren of the silver screen Pola Negri, who\
  \ channelled a message of titanic importance through me. However, what she had to\
  \ say is no concern of yours. I trust you will admit that you have traduced the\
  \ reputation of Pippin the Younger and rectify your error at once.\nYours sincerely,\
  \ Madame Boubou the Mystic\n[2007-05-22]"
