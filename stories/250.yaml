text: "Episode 849 of Hooting Yard's \u2018detergent opera bouffe\u2019, loosely based\
  \ on the groundbreaking STV series of 1980.\nWhooper swans whooped on the airport\
  \ pond. Beyond it, by the grain silo, the airport squirrel skittered and twitched,\
  \ as if terrified. But it was on home ground, and scared of nothing. As with all\
  \ squirrels, its twitching was merely the outward sign of its high metabolic rate.\
  \ A path led from the grain silo to Runway Number Nineteen, where on this fogbound\
  \ morning a supersonic \xFCberjet from a bygone era sat rusting on the gravel. Nineteen\
  \ had been the experimental runway, where madcap airport boffin Dr Loopy Streisand\
  \ used to conduct his madcap boffinry, before his transfer to another airport in\
  \ another country on another continent far away across the sea. He had not welcomed\
  \ the move, flailing his weirdly dainty little fists at the airport security guards\
  \ who dragged him forcibly from his boffin hut and shoved him on to a chopper. That\
  \ was years ago now, neither the whooper swans nor the squirrel had been born, but\
  \ everyone knew that Dr Streisand was forever plotting his return\u2026 and his\
  \ revenge.\nIt was the ever-present nature of the madcap boffin's threat that explains\
  \ why this episode of Airport Chaplain opens, as they all do, with the pre-breakfast\
  \ Counter Streisand meeting. For very clever strategic reasons, the meeting is held\
  \ in a different part of the airport each day, although due to budgetary constraints\
  \ the team invariably gathers in the canteen. And what a great canteen it is! Here,\
  \ they will be able to have their breakfasts as soon as the meeting concludes, except\
  \ of course for the airport hunger artist, who will scamper back to his pod suspended\
  \ from the branches of a sturdy oak tree in the airport spinney. And it is at the\
  \ edge of the spinney where we find the massive stone slab which serves as the airport\
  \ chaplain's altar, upon which the daily sacrifice of a goat is made. More on that\
  \ later.\nHere is an example of the stuff that was said at the meeting:\n\u201C\
  According to the consoles, what is your apprehension of the proximity or distance\
  \ of the mad boffin bent on revenge?\u201D\n\u201CReadings confirm that we remain\
  \ steadfast on code lavender.\u201D\n\u201CFie! \u2018Tis but a poltroon's capstick!\u201D\
  \nAlso before breakfast an indication is given of a new plot development. For example,\
  \ the airport floozy may let slip a creeping disdain for the new moustache grown\
  \ upon the upper lip of the airport tinker. Both her disdain and his moustache will\
  \ prove significant in the weeks leading up to the Beltane bonfire.\nMeanwhile,\
  \ in his cubicle dug into the bunker below the airport socks-and-neckties franchise,\
  \ Eric Maxwell Davies, the night watchman, settles down for his well-earned kip.\
  \ His back story is important. He has often behaved skittishly, and equally often\
  \ been such a sobersides that gloomy music accompanied his appearance. Desolate\
  \ bells clanged as his signature tune in many episodes. Explicit hints are dropped\
  \ that he may be the fictional brother of Peter Maxwell Davies, the Master of the\
  \ Queen's Music, and tension is sometimes created by having Eric's scenes filmed\
  \ with the whooper swans visible in the background, suggesting to viewers that,\
  \ as his brother once did, Eric might eat them. So feeble is the power of the generator\
  \ in this corner of the airport, however, that none of the swans has yet been electrocuted,\
  \ a necessary precursor to it ending up on Eric's dinner plate.\nUnkempt and hairy,\
  \ the recipient of an alarming number of blood transfusions, the airport chaplain\
  \ lumbered into view from behind a pasteboard partition. Around his neck he wore\
  \ a loop of string from which hung bones and teeth and fragments of the true cross.\
  \ As he never tired of roaring at the congregations who packed into his chapel,\
  \ his was an interfaith chaplaincy, where all known Gods held sway, except one or\
  \ two of the Ancient Egyptian ones, whose wrath the chaplain had incurred in a long\
  \ ago episode fondly remembered by a happy few. Before heading out to the spinney,\
  \ the airport chaplain had to hear a confession from the apprentice goat boy, a\
  \ seething, fractious, unhinged, dyspeptic, rancorous, unhygienic, cloth-eared,\
  \ bitter child. For the past four years there had been a conceit that goat boy was\
  \ forever busy in his workshop building the sacrificial goats out of plasticine\
  \ and straw, always off-screen, and plonking him into the confessional box was seen\
  \ as a clever variation.\nFather Umberto\_: What do you have to confess, goat boy?\n\
  Goat Boy [off screen]\_: I am the love child of mad airport boffin Loopy Streisand\
  \ and am constantly scheming to effect his return, whereupon he shall wreak his\
  \ revenge upon the personnel of the airport, including the floozy and the tinker\
  \ and Eric Maxwell Davies the night watchman, and you, airport chaplain!\nFather\
  \ Umberto\_: What the\u2026.?\nAfter a pause of uncomfortable duration, we hear\
  \ tinkly music composed by a paranormalist with access to Tony Hatch's brainpans,\
  \ and the credits roll.\n[2007-10-14]"
