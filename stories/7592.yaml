text: "Yesterday I watched The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963) on television, and\
  \ I was struck by a scene about an hour into the film which fatally undermines the\
  \ plot. Up to that point, we are rooting for the Allied prisoners of war who, as\
  \ is usual in such dramas, say things like \u201COK, chaps, let's form an Escape\
  \ Committee and smoke our pipes\u201D, and we accept their statements that it is\
  \ their duty to try to escape and to otherwise make life as difficult as possible\
  \ for their Boche captors.\nBut then comes the scene where Blythe, played by Donald\
  \ Pleasence, gives an ornithology lecture to some of the men. He whistles the song\
  \ of the warbler, and then shows them how to draw the masked shrike. We are asked\
  \ to believe that sensible British chaps would rather risk gruesome death at the\
  \ hands of the Gestapo when they could see out the war having bird-life explained\
  \ to them by eerie-eyed Donald Pleasence. This seems to me utterly implausible,\
  \ and for all the thrills and spills of the remaining two hours, I think the film\
  \ would have been much better had it concentrated solely on Blythe's ornithology\
  \ classes.\n\n[2011-11-14]"
