text: "A card popped through the letterbox today from the Morning Star Church Of God.\
  \ I wondered if this was evidence of some new alliance between the Communist Party\
  \ and evangelical Christians. Maybe the sermons would consist of harangues from\
  \ the editorial pages of the Morning Star about the necessity of building the class\
  \ struggle by going on strike every five minutes. I looked in vain for a hammer-and-sickle-and-crucifix\
  \ motif on the card, then turned my attention to the text:\nAre You A Victim?, it\
  \ read, Every person is victimised by Satan, either by Depression, Stress, Heart\
  \ Problems, Baroness, Skin Diseases, Kidney, Cancer, ENT and many more. No Hope\
  \ + No Cure = No Peace. But There Is Hope.\nMy initial surmise about the Communist\
  \ element was clearly correct. Not only does Satan plague us with ailments and infirmities,\
  \ but sets the aristocracy against us in the form of that Baroness. I pictured a\
  \ sort of fairy tale baddie, or \u201CBaroness\u201D Margaret Thatcher, though of\
  \ course it's hard to tell the difference.\nIncidentally, when I am eventually ennobled,\
  \ as is bound to happen sooner or later, I think I'd like to be a Baron. The title\
  \ has a medieval, or Mitteleuropean quality about it that \u2018Lord\u2019 or \u2018\
  Earl\u2019 or \u2018Duke\u2019 somehow lack.\n[2007-05-15]"
