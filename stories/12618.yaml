text: "I learned today that the spooky Scandinavian vampire novel Let The Right One\
  \ In, first adapted\u2014very successfully\u2014for the screen, has now been turned\
  \ into a theatrical production. But not just any old production. No, this is Let\
  \ The Right One In\u2014On Ice!\nPerhaps it is just me whose brain turns to putty\
  \ when I hear those dread words\u2014On Ice!\u2014appended to a title. I can think\
  \ of few less edifying experiences than watching a drama\u2014any drama\u2014given\
  \ the skating-rink treatment.\nBut audiences do seem to lap them up, so it strikes\
  \ me that it might be financially profitable to turn my hand to such an adaptation.\
  \ What would be even more unlikely than a moody vampire yarn? My initial thoughts\
  \ turn to The Anatomy Of Melancholy On Ice!, or The Strange Death Of Liberal England\
  \ On Ice! But I am drawn irresistibly to the titanic challenge that would be Christopher\
  \ Smart's Jubilate Agno On Ice!\nFirst I must contact Andrew Lloyd Webber to do\
  \ the music. If he insists on roller skates rather than ice skates, I might be open\
  \ to persuasion.\n[2014-04-08]"
