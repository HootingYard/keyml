text: "The other day the BBC Parliament channel showed a repeat of the general election\
  \ coverage from February 1974. This is precisely the kind of thing I can watch,\
  \ avidly, for hours. I rarely essay political topics here at Hooting Yard, but when\
  \ not engaged in high level research into matters Dobsonian or limning the contours\
  \ of Bodger's Spinney or whatever else I prattle on about, I can be a terrible political\
  \ pointyhead. There is a special fascination with old archive footage\u2014the haircuts,\
  \ the fruity pronunciation, the clunking technology, the on-screen fug of tobacco\
  \ smoke, the impossibly youthful appearance of people still in the public eye, the\
  \ phantoms of those who are dead and gone\u2026\nOf many treasurable moments, one\
  \ in particular stood out for me. Jeremy Thorpe was down in his Devon constituency,\
  \ on camera yet speaking to the London studio via a large green telephone receiver\
  \ clutched tight against his ear, and as he signed off he said he was planning to\
  \ spend the weekend doing lots of gardening before returning to the fray on Monday.\
  \ Back in the studio, Alastair Burnet said, very casually, \u201CJeremy Thorpe there,\
  \ very Voltairean\u2026 now, some more results\u2026\u201D\nI cannot imagine any\
  \ presenter today making that comment, either because they wouldn't be capable of\
  \ doing so, or, if they were, it would be considered too obscure a reference for\
  \ the viewers, who need to be treated like slow-witted infants.\nI will, of course,\
  \ be glued to the screen for hours come the forthcoming election, and will enjoy\
  \ every minute of the coverage. But if any reference at all is made to anything\
  \ outside the hermetically-sealed world o\u2019 Westminster, it will be to an airhead\
  \ \u201Ccelebrity\u201D rather than to an Enlightenment philosophe.\n[2010-02-20]"
