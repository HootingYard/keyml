text: "\nM is for Mead, that is Dr Richard Mead (1673\u20131754), and also for his\
  \ Medica Sacra\_: Or, A Commentary On The Most Remarkable Diseases Mentioned In\
  \ The Holy Scriptures (1748, posthumously reprinted 1755). Here you can read about\
  \ the diseases of Job, Jehoram, Judas, Herod, and others, also of palsy, demoniacs,\
  \ and \u201Cthe bloody sweat of Christ\u201D. The full text is online, and to whet\
  \ your appetite here is part of Mead's chapter on the disease of our old pal King\
  \ Nebuchadnezzar:\n\u201CThose things, which are related of Nebuchadnezzar king\
  \ of Babylon, appear so surprizing and contrary to nature, that some interpreters\
  \ have imagined that he was really transformed into a beast. For \u2018being driven\
  \ from the company of men for seven years, his dwelling was with the beasts of the\
  \ field, he fed on grass as oxen; his body was wetted with the dew of heaven; his\
  \ hair and nails were grown like those of birds. At length at the end of that space\
  \ of time, his understanding was restored to him, and he was established in his\
  \ kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto him. Now his crime was pride and\
  \ the contempt of God\u2019 [See Daniel, Chap. iv. and v.]\n\u201CAll these circumstances\
  \ agree so perfectly well with hypochondriacal madness, that to me it appears evident,\
  \ that Nebuchadnezzar was seized with this distemper, and under its influence ran\
  \ wild into the fields: and that, fancying himself transformed into an ox, he fed\
  \ on grass in the manner of cattle. For every sort of madness is, as I shall specify\
  \ more particularly hereafter, a disease of a disturbed imagination; which this\
  \ unhappy man laboured under full seven years. And thro\u2019 neglect of taking\
  \ proper care of himself, his hair and nails grew to an excessive length; whereby\
  \ the latter growing thicker and crooked, resembled the claws of birds. Now, the\
  \ ancients called persons affected with this species of madness [Greek: lykanthr\xF4\
  poi] or [Greek: kynanthr\xF4poi]; because they went abroad in the night, imitating\
  \ wolves or dogs; particularly intent upon opening the sepulchres of the dead, and\
  \ had their legs much ulcerated either by frequent falls, or the bites of dogs.\u201D\
  \nADDENDUM\_: I suppose, given the day, that M ought to have stood for Miliband.\
  \ Thereagain, if we are to have an M Addendum, I would prefer that it be this quotation\
  \ from Charles Darwin, from one of his letters\_: \u201CWould anyone trust in the\
  \ convictions of a monkey's mind?\u201D\n[2010-09-25]"
