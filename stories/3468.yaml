text: "For many of us, there comes a time when we may need to consult the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman about some matter of psychomagickal significance. We might seek answers\
  \ to questions such as;\n\u2013 What is the difference between good wool and bad\
  \ wool?\n\u2013 Is \u201CDavid Carpenter\u201D an appropriate name for my cat?\n\
  \u2013 Did a part of my tulpa perish when the airship Hindenburg exploded in flames\
  \ as it attempted to dock with its mooring mast on Thursday 6 May 1937?\nBut to\
  \ consult with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, we first have to find her, and of course\
  \ she lives all alone in her magick and dilapidated cottage somewhere in the densest\
  \ part of the dark, dark woods. So before hiking out there, in the night, without\
  \ a map, wouldn't it be great if we could somehow practise seeking the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman in the comfort of our own non-magick and undilapidated homes?\nWell, now\
  \ we can! The new board game Pore Over A Diagram Of The Dark, Dark Woods And See\
  \ If You Can Spot The Woohoohoodiwoo Woman provides hours of fun and frolic for\
  \ all the family. Just print out the diagram of the dark, dark woods below, paste\
  \ it on to a board, lay the board flat on your floor, and pore over it, with both\
  \ eyes, until you spot the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. Then, when you eventually need\
  \ to hike out to the real dark, dark woods, on a real storm-wracked night, to find\
  \ the real Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, you will be mentally, physically, magickally, and\
  \ psychically prepared. I think it's another triumph for the toy-and-board-game\
  \ manufacturing community!\n\nPicture courtesy of the splendid Ptak Science Books\
