text: 'Back in 2007, and then again in 2010, I wrote about Kaka. Although I did not
  mention it specifically, I was at the time under the impression that Kaka was a
  foopballer. I have now learned that Kaka is, in fact, a bird. This sheds an entirely
  new light on things, and I fear I must go back to the drawing-board.
