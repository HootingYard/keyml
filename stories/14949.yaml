text: "An occasional feature of my dreamworld is the appearance of a nonsensical word\
  \ or phrase which\u2014within the dream\u2014takes on huge, if intangible, significance.\
  \ Previous dreams have revealed to me the crucial importance of Bomba, the Glove\
  \ of Ib, and the startling yet compelling realisation that my milieu is that of\
  \ Dr Ludwig. All these things are of great import until I awake, at which point\
  \ their utter stupidity becomes apparent.\nThe latest manifestation occurred a few\
  \ nights ago, when I was made aware of the ancient chivalric code of Eel Zzub. By\
  \ following the precepts of Eel Zzub, I would become a person of great honour and\
  \ probity. The fact that such precepts were not in any way made clear in the dream\
  \ was irrelevant. Eel Zzub was the way to go\u2014at least until I woke up.\nI would\
  \ add two points, which may or may not be pertinent. First, it was resoundingly\
  \ clear, in the dream, that the Eel of Eel Zzub was nothing whatsoever to do with\
  \ eels. Second, in my waking state I could not help but recall that Zzub Books was\
  \ a wholly fictitious publisher of slim volumes of twee verse, invented by Ed Baxter\
  \ and listed in one of the Small Press Yearbooks circa 1990.\n[2016-12-04]"
