  \ come upon a reliable Gish-wasp story.\nNow, useful mileage there may be if we\
  \ are talking about Tallulah Bankhead and hornets, or Nova Pilbeam and German wasps,\
  \ or even Vilma Banky and bees. In the latter case we even have a story involving\
  \ ectoplasmic bee goo, though it has been suppressed by Vilma Banky's estate, for\
  \ understandable reasons.\nI hope that makes things clear.\n[2009-09-17]"
