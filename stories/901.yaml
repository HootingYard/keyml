  \ spotted that you now only get the opening lines of each post, and will have to\
  \ visit the site itself to read the whole thing. The purpose of this change is not\
  \ to inconvenience you unduly, but to ensure that you are compelled to keep glancing\
  \ to the right, where you cannot fail to see the books available\u2014a fourth one\
  \ is due early in 2009\u2014and of course the \u2018Donate\u2019 button, designed\
  \ to instil pangs of unbearable guilt that so many, many words have been offered\
  \ freely over the past five years.\xC2\_\nADDENDUM\_: Actually, I ought to say that\
  \ not all readers need be beset by guilt-pangs, as some of you have been very generous.\
  \ You know who you are, and I thank you.\n[2008-11-04]"
