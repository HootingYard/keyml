  \ length of time will know that in the final decade of the twentieth century I produced\
  \ four\u2014or was it five?\u2014Hooting Yard Calendars. Certain persons have tried\
  \ to cajole me into reviving this undoubted boon to the date-befuddled, but for\
  \ the time being you are going to have to make do with the pale shadow of the calendar\
  \ proper that is this year's Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. Today's picture, however,\
  \ is the sole remnant of an abortive calendar, from (I think) 1996, which was to\
  \ be entitled something along the lines of Treasures From The Istvan Plunkett Postage\
  \ Stamp Collection. This one shows, according to my notes, \u201Ca trio of ne'er-do-wells\
  \ brandishing whisks and celery\u201D.\n\n[2011-12-13]"
