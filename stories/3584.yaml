text: 'The first thing of note I learned on Christmas morning is that in Berkshire,
  to the south-west of the village of Hermitage, is a small area of land with the
  sonorous name Gravelly Pightles.

  Perhaps a kindly Berkshireist Hooting Yard reader with nothing better to do could
  hie over there with a camera and photograph it, preferably in black and white, during
  a drizzle?
