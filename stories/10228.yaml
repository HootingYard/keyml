text: "Over the past year or so in Miss Blossom Partridge's Weekly Digest, Miss Blossom\
  \ Partridge has been publishing a fascinating series entitled \u201CFemale Missionaries\
  \ Of The Victorian And Edwardian Eras\u201D. I was particularly enchanted by a recent\
  \ piece on the Edwardian missionary Mrs Diphtheria Croak, and sought permission\
  \ to repost it here\u2014that permission being granted after I made a small donation\
  \ to Miss Blossom Partridge's Charitable Fund For The Relief Of Distressed And Destitute\
  \ Bus Conductors\u2019 Widows And Orphans (Penge). Read and enjoy!\nOne of the most\
  \ venturesome of the female missionaries of the Victorian and Edwardian eras was\
  \ Mrs Diphtheria Croak, widow of \u201CChippy\u201D Croak, the one-legged country\
  \ parson and amateur wrestler who went down with the Titanic. She did not accompany\
  \ her husband on the fateful voyage, being, by her own account \u201Cparalysed with\
  \ terror by the vast pitiless sea\u201D. Yet within a few years of \u201CChippy\u201D\
  's death, she was rarely to be found on land, plying the oceans aboard a series\
  \ of liners and clippers and packet steamers. Eschewing the comforts of a cabin,\
  \ she spent most of her time out on deck, scanning the waters day and night through\
  \ her pince nez. Many thought that, unhinged by grief, she was searching for her\
  \ lost husband. But that was not it. That was not it at all. Mrs Croak was in the\
  \ grip of a mania, sure enough, but it was a mania of a different, and far stranger,\
  \ kidney.\nI first became aware of the existence of a colony of giant albino kangaroos,\
  \ she wrote, when sorting through my late husband's papers after his death. In among\
  \ the drafts of sermons, newspaper cuttings of amateur wrestling bouts, and mad\
  \ hysterical screeds scratched in ducks\u2019 blood in an unknown alphabet, I chanced\
  \ upon an article torn out of a periodical which made mention, inter alia, of giant\
  \ albino kangaroos.\nImmediately my heart went out to these poor benighted creatures.\
  \ What kind of life must it be?, I wondered, to be gigantic and albino and to go\
  \ hopping about like an abomination of nature? I determined at once to go among\
  \ them, bringing succour and Christ, that they may know the Lord has abandoned none\
  \ of his creation. But first I had to discover where they dwelt.\nThis was easier\
  \ said than done, for Mrs Diphtheria Croak was a geographically obtuse woman who\
  \ had absolutely no sense of direction. Often, leaving the country parsonage to\
  \ buy eggs from a peasant who lived but a few yards away to the right, Mrs Croak\
  \ would turn left out of her door and wander for hours, or days, eggless and ditsy.\
  \ She had no understanding of the visible horizon, thinking there was something\
  \ amiss with her eyesight, and demanding ever more powerful pince nez from her eye\
  \ doctor.\nThus it was that she embarked upon her senseless series of sea voyages.\
  \ Sooner or later, she reasoned, if she peered with sufficient intensity from the\
  \ railings of an ocean-going vessel, she would spy land. She further reasoned that\
  \ the albino kangaroos being giants, they ought to be easy to spot, hopping about\
  \ in their abominable Godless fashion.\nAnd so for seven years she sailed hither\
  \ and yon, from continent to continent, port to port, keeping a lookout. In her\
  \ reticule she kept several Bibles and a bag of millet, the latter a gift she intended\
  \ to present to the leader of the giant albino kangaroos as a token of her goodwill.\
  \ She was not sure kangaroos ate millet, but consoled herself with the idea that,\
  \ if they did not, they could find some other use for it. Eventually she ended up\
  \ eating it herself, to keep body and soul together when marooned for a month on\
  \ a remote atoll following a maritime mishap.\nBrrrr!, I said to myself one morning,\
  \ it is very chilly and no mistake!, she wrote, This was seven years into my search,\
  \ and to date I had seen no signs of the giant albino kangaroos. But I am a single-minded\
  \ widow of great determination, and I knew in the very depths of my immortal soul\
  \ that without me, the giant albino kangaroos would never bask in the magnificent\
  \ effulgence of Christ Our Lord. It was quite impossible that I should abandon them.\
  \ Now, as I leaned over the railings peering with great intensity into the distance,\
  \ I saw enormous and forbidding cliffs of ice. No wonder it was chilly! A sailor\
  \ was swabbing the deck nearby, so I asked him where we were. \u2018That is the\
  \ Antarctic, madam,\u2019 he replied, \u2018So you had better wrap up warm!\u2019\
  \ I was glad he warned me, for when we made landfall some hours later it had grown\
  \ colder still.\nSome instinct must have told Mrs Croak she was, at last, on the\
  \ right track, for with a dainty wave to the sailors she set off across the ice\
  \ towards the enormous and forbidding cliffs.\nSeveral years later, a ship landed\
  \ at the same spot on the Antarctic coast. As the sailors played an impromptu game\
  \ of ice hockey, they were astonished to see, emerging from the cold white expanse\
  \ of nothingness, a country parson's widow. She was carrying a reticule and peering\
  \ at them through her pince nez. It was Mrs Diphtheria Croak.\n\u201CMight I board\
  \ your ship and sail back to Blighty?\u201D she asked, \u201CMy work here is done.\u201D\
  \nAnd back in Blighty she wrote an account of her years in the Antarctic.\nNothing\
  \ had prepared me for the look of joy on the faces of those giant albino kangaroos,\
  \ she wrote, When I dinned into their big kangaroo heads the overwhelming love of\
  \ Christ Jesus. Now when they hop about in their freezing ice-girt wasteland, it\
  \ is no longer the hopping of Satan's spawn. They hop for the Lord, who they see\
  \ as a giant albino kangaroo much like themselves, only bigger and whiter. It is\
  \ an image of Christ I have come to share, hence the somewhat unusual wood-carvings\
  \ that keep me gainfully occupied and have become a feature of my country parsonage\
  \ garden.\nMrs Croak died in 1934. Her wood-carvings were carted off by a rascally\
  \ tinker. It is not known what became of them.\n[2012-09-26]"
