text: "Readers will recall Unconscious Squirrel!, the unsuccessful cartoon strip about\
  \ an unconscious squirrel created, and then abandoned, by Lamont Pinochet. One hesitates\
  \ to say that the character is much-lamented, as nobody took much notice of the\
  \ strip when it appeared, and Pinochet himself found it tiresome, so much so that\
  \ he used to fall asleep while drawing it.\nNow, in a bold move, the unconscious\
  \ squirrel has been revived in a new potboiler by Pebblehead. The Nuts Of Narcolepsy\
  \ is set in a woodland idyll, where an unsuspecting squirrel eats some poisoned\
  \ or contaminated nuts which cause it to swoon into unconsciousness. As ever, the\
  \ bestselling paperbackist handles his material in a bravura manner, investing his\
  \ simple tale with stylistic flourishes and cracking dialogue, displaying an enviable\
  \ command of the exclamation mark. Early reviews have been positive, with Lex Pilg\
  \ in the Daily Hubbub Monitor praising it as \u201Ca real page-turner of the sort\
  \ we expect from Pebblehead, with thrills and spills aplenty\u201D, while the angling\
  \ magazine Minnows In Nets noted with approval its lack of clunk.\nCuriously, The\
  \ Nuts Of Narcolepsy is dedicated to the memory of Eric Fogg (1903\u20131939), the\
  \ English composer who fell, or possibly threw himself, under a tube train at Waterloo\
  \ station on the eve of his second marriage. An open verdict was recorded. There\
  \ is no evidence that Fogg had a thing about squirrels, and Pebblehead has never\
  \ expressed any previous interest in him, nor about English music in general. The\
  \ paperbackist is known to be an enthusiast for noisy aggressive Germans. We shall\
  \ have to await the deliberations of those dedicated folk who compile the annual\
  \ Register Of Dedicatees Of Potboilers for enlightenment.\nInterviewed on the porch\
  \ steps of a particularly sordid bordello, Pebblehead dropped hints that we will\
  \ be seeing more of the unconscious squirrel.\n\u201CI find,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  There comes a point when my characters take on a life of their own. It is almost\
  \ as if I am a reporter, or a biographer, rather than a novelist. You will recall\
  \ Digby Smew, the fascist podcaster who first appeared in my book The Assassination\
  \ Of Stephen Fry. Sometimes I fancy he is sitting at breakfast with me, slurping\
  \ porridge with disgusting table manners. I can't even remember writing the other\
  \ forty potboilers of which he is the protagonist. The words come unsummoned. I\
  \ have an inkling that something similar will happen with the unconscious squirrel.\
  \ Now that the basic lineaments of his character have been established\u2014that\
  \ he is a squirrel, that he is unconscious\u2014already he seems freed from the\
  \ confines of my own pulsating writerly cranium. I swear to God he took on corporeal\
  \ form this morning. I was eating my breakfast, and across the table there was Digby\
  \ Smew, and he was staring at something, something behind me, and I turned to look\
  \ and got a fugitive glimpse of a narcoleptic squirrel snuggled against the wainscot,\
  \ shimmering in a hallucinogenic haze for a moment before the vision dissolved.\
  \ But I know he will be back, and I have already felt impelled to dash off twenty\
  \ thousand words of a second Unconscious Squirrel! potboiler. I don't want to give\
  \ too much away, but in this one he plays a leading role in the Hindenburg Disaster.\u201D\
  \nWhen he was able to get a word in edgeways, Pebblehead's interviewer taxed him\
  \ with the point that he had not in fact created the unconscious squirrel, but taken\
  \ him, in all his particulars, from an almost forgotten cartoon strip by the creator\
  \ of Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet.\n\u201CThat is indeed true,\u201D said the paperbackist,\
  \ having now unfurled his umbrella against an unprecedented downpour, \u201CAnd\
  \ I have never tried to conceal the fact. If you knew anything about my work, you\
  \ would know I have revived and reinvented existing fictional characters before,\
  \ many a time. I have written, at the last count, twenty-six short stories about\
  \ Doctor Slop, from The Life And Opinions Of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence\
  \ Sterne, and a trilogy of sci-fi adventures featuring Brave Driver Josef Bong from\
  \ The Good Soldier \xC5\_vejk by Jaroslav Ha\xC5\xA1ek. They too, have become very\
  \ real to me, though for some reason neither of them ever comes to breakfast. Doctor\
  \ Slop is usually hovering on the landing, and Josef Bong sits in the potting shed\
  \ on my allotment, whistling.\u201D\nThe revelation that Pebblehead maintains an\
  \ allotment will come as a shock to his readers. How in the name of all that is\
  \ holy, one wonders, does so indefatigable a paperbackist find time to grow radishes\
  \ and kohlrabi and tomatoes and potatoes and bugloss and beetroot and hollyhocks,\
  \ not only to grow them but to keep them free of hideous diseases and the predations\
  \ of tiny parasitic creeping things? Annoyingly, the interviewer did not pursue\
  \ this fascinating line of inquiry. Dismayed by rainfall, he left Pebblehead standing\
  \ alone on the steps of the bordello, tucked his notepad into an inner pocket, gave\
  \ his pencil to a vagrant, and ducked into the shelter of a railway station, descending\
  \ the escalator to catch a train back to his office. All the more perplexing when\
  \ one considers that he was working for a magazine entitled Potboilers And Allotments\
  \ And The Social Glue That Binds Them.\nIn an echo of the past, the railway station\
  \ into which the rainsoaked reporter hurried was Waterloo, and he fell, or possibly\
  \ threw himself, under a train from the very same platform from which Eric Fogg\
  \ fell, or threw himself, seventy years ago to the day.\n\n[2009-07-17]"
