text: "I remember, as a schoolboy\u2026 passing a huge tureen of soup, without first\
  \ serving myself, down the oblong trestle table at which my fellow pupils and I\
  \ were seated. Suddenly, one of the supervising staff, our Latin master, an ex-army\
  \ man, roared from the top table to ask me why I was not having any. \u201CFrankly,\
  \ sir,\u201D I replied in a supercilious voice, the memory of which, to this very\
  \ day, grates on me as much as the voice itself must once have grated on everyone\
  \ who knew me, \u201CI find soup rather a bore.\u201D Whereupon, to my horror, he\
  \ leapt to his feet, marched the length of the refectory hall and, now unnervingly\
  \ puce of feature, stood over me. \u201CA bore?\u201D he barked, \u201CYou find\
  \ it a bore, do you? Well, let me tell you, Adair, you putrid little twerp, had\
  \ you been in a Jap prisoner-of-war camp during the last war, as I was, you would\
  \ have been delighted to be bored with some soup! Oh yes, you would have got down\
  \ on your knees and begged to be bored out of your gruesome little mind!\u201D Needless\
  \ to say, I ate the soup\u2014and, from that formative moment on, I got, as it were,\
  \ the hang of the thing.\nGilbert Adair, \u201COn Soup\u201D, collected in Surfing\
