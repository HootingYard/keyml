text: "To celebrate what would have been Samuel Beckett's one hundred and third birthday\
  \ on Monday, Nige (whom I've not come across before) quoted from Watt:\n\u201CThe\
  \ crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others and the\
  \ pastures red with uneaten sheep's placentas and the long summer days and the new-mown\
  \ hay and the wood-pigeon in the morning and the cuckoo in the afternoon and the\
  \ corncrake in the evening and the wasps in the jam and the smell of the gorse and\
  \ the look of the gorse and the apples falling and the children walking in the dead\
  \ leaves and the larch turning brown a week before the others and the chestnuts\
  \ falling and the howling winds and the sea breaking over the pier and the first\
  \ fires and the hooves on the road and the consumptive postman whistling The Roses\
  \ Are Blooming in Picardy and the standard oil-lamp and of course the snow and to\
  \ be sure the sleet and bless your heart the slush and every fourth year the February\
  \ debacle and the endless April showers and the crocuses and then the whole bloody\
  \ business starting over again.\u201D\nAs is probably crystal clear, Watt\u2014\
  along with much else of Beckett's prose\u2014is a key text for Mr Key. It remains\
  \ for me one of the funniest books I have ever read. I was introduced to Beckett\
  \ by my English teacher when I was about fifteen. The teacher's name was Dick Shone\u2014\
  the schoolboy joke was that, as an English teacher, he lived in a Dick-Shone-ry.\
  \ He was a fine pedagogue with a talent for withering sarcasm, and I remember him\
  \ with affection.\n\_\n[2009-04-15]"
