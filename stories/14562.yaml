text: "Once upon a time there was a little Italian boy made out of wood. He wore a\
  \ pointy hat, also wooden. In this age of grand illusion, he walked into my life\
  \ out of my dreams, and forced his way into my scheme of things. This was somewhat\
  \ unnerving, for it is not an everyday occurrence to find oneself in thrall to a\
  \ wooden boy. But enthralled I was, to the point where the tables were turned and\
  \ I tried to fit in with his scheme of things.\nIn order to do so, I felt I needed\
  \ to gain a better understanding of what it was like to be made of wood. So I drove\
  \ to the forest in a Japanese car. I parked at the edge, by a pond, and then I walked\
  \ deep into the forest and stood there, pretending to be a tree, a pine or an elm.\
  \ At first I was fidgety, but as the hours passed I found it easier to stand perfectly\
  \ still, as if I were wooden. I swayed slightly in the breeze.\nThe little Italian\
  \ boy made of wood had not followed me to the forest, for he could not drive. I\
  \ wondered what he was up to, back in my chalet, perched on the edge of a glacier.\
  \ It was a wooden chalet, so it suited him well, better, in fact, than it suited\
  \ me. I felt so at home in the forest. Oh I so wanted to sprout leaves and buds!\n\
  Several months passed before I was forced to admit that I could not fit in to his\
  \ scheme of things and that I was not, nor ever would be. made out of wood. I trudged\
  \ back through the forest towards the pond where I had parked the Japanese car.\
  \ It had been stolen. I sat on a tuffet next to the pond and I pondered. Pondering\
  \ by a pond, not made of wood. The sky was immense and immensely blue.\nIt was a\
  \ small mercy that I did not know the little wooden Italian boy was a delinquent\
  \ rascal, and had burned down my chalet the instant I screeched away in my Japanese\
  \ car. And yet the world keeps turning. That, after all, is in the scheme of things,\
  \ whether one is wooden or\u2014let us be plain\u2014not wooden, not wooden at all,\
  \ neither pine nor elm nor any of the other types of wood. They all burn.\n[2016-02-12]"
