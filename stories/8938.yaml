text: "Further to yesterday's potted history of the Malice Aforethought Press, I rummaged\
  \ in a paper-midden and found a dog-eared copy of our 1988 mail order catalogue.\
  \ I thought it might be of historical interest to reproduce some of the contents,\
  \ in spite of the sinking feeling I had as I read my blurbs and shuddered at the,\
  \ er, gaudiness of my prose.\nAll of these pamphlets are of course out of print,\
  \ though most of the texts were collected in the 1989 paperback Twitching And Shattered.\
  \ That, too, is out of print, but copies occasionally crop up on eBay or in secondhand\
  \ bookshops or for auction here at Hooting Yard.\nPreface\n  The Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press was established in 1986 for the express purpose of scraping vegetable matter,\
  \ rinds, and caked grime from the interior walls of a large iron bran-tub. However,\
  \ this dreadful scheme met only with ignominy and ruin. Fleeing to a sanatorium\
  \ in Greenland, the Malice Aforethought Press held a number of fruitless meetings\
  \ with aviators, bonnibels, conspirators, dolts, ecclesiastics, fanatics, gaberlunzies,\
  \ hacks, idiots, joskins, kakas, lepers, mahouts, notaries, obfuscators, polatouches,\
  \ quaestors, revengers, succubae, tziganes, uhlans, vipers, wags, xemas, yahoos,\
  \ and zealots. Halfway through this series of conferences, the sanatorium was uprooted\
  \ from the sod and pitchforked into the demented ocean by an inexplicable force.\
  \ Things looked grim. Saved from drowning by the intervention of a crumpled urchin,\
  \ the Malice Aforethought Press returned to England, determined to enwrap the bran-tub\
  \ in massive, fibrous blankets. Thousands upon thousands of eager volunteers had\
  \ to be turned away, ejected into hailstorms through the rotting wooden portal which\
  \ fronts our monstrous office. As a sop to these thousands, the Malice Aforethought\
  \ Press has arranged to publish a selection of documents which lay bare the true\
  \ history of the rusted cooking-pots stacked higgledy-piggledy in the corridors\
  \ of a smashed-up building painted crimson\u2026\nHoots Of Destiny\n  Three graphic\
  \ stories. Many pictures, a few words.\n1. Fun with gravel\n  2. L'Histoire du paving\
  \ slabs\n  3. Why do potatoes exist?\nWhy indeed? An unclassifiable work of shining\
  \ lucidity and brazen incorrigibility. The leitmotifs of this ridiculous publication,\
  \ the keys to its charm, are many and various. One could perhaps single out an eyebrow,\
  \ a hake, an inspirational choir funnel. Each copy is produced by our Frank on an\
  \ individual basis; Hoots Of Destiny is part hand-drawn, part hand-written, and\
  \ hand-coloured throughout. Each copy is dated, numbered, signed, and dedicated.\
  \ So there. The perfect gift for bailiffs, Jesuit fathers, or menacing figures draped\
  \ in grisly shifts.\nForty Visits To The Worm Farm\n  A hectic tale of malfeasance\
  \ and calumny, set in an exciting worm farm. Whisks, turnips, and dangerous machinery\
  \ abound, and the cast of unlikely characters includes Canute Hellhound, whose tremendous,\
  \ ground-breaking lecture on the pith and nubs of wormery is reprinted in part.\
  \ This pure and urgent work brings together the Sacred and the Profane, the Dim\
  \ and the Doomed, and the Patron Saint of Worms with his Destiny. Our classic bestseller!\
  \ The text is accompanied by four illustrations in which the author depicts his\
  \ characters with withering intensity. If you buy only one book this year, you would\
  \ be advised to seek medical help.\nTales Of Hoon\n  A magnificent collection of\
  \ four crumpled yarns set in the dismal, sump-strewn land of Hoon, with the odd\
  \ detour to its hinterland of purple hills and bauxite mines. A cast of hundreds,\
  \ most of whom are called Ned, appears in these rum and preposterous stories. As\
  \ a special treat, the texts are complemented by three maps and a really exciting\
  \ A3 fold-out diagram, hand-coloured and unbelievably lavish. Each copy also contains\
  \ a piece of sandpaper. Truly a labour of love; either that or sheer dementia.\n\
  A Zest For Crumpled Things\n  Twenty-six potted biographies of characters whose\
  \ behaviour would be out of place in most of what passes for \u201Cfiction\u201D\
  \ these days. The texts make use of neologism, poltroonery, and reverential plagiarism\
  \ of M P Shiel (1865\u20131947). Among those potted by Frank's doolally pen are\
  \ Maud Abdab, Cora Dwabb, Istvan Ick, Ned Lip, and Jodhpur Valentine. With twenty-six\
  \ photographs from the author's collection, rescued from an incinerator in the cellar\
  \ of a ruinous building in the north of England.\nThe Churn In The Muck\n  A couple\
  \ of stories; one about ponds, hotels, and hollyhocks, the other about hotels, hollyhocks,\
  \ and ponds. More alphabetical excursions by Frank, who doesn't intend to abandon\
  \ this compositional device until he has well and truly wrung its neck. Biographical\
  \ notes on the main characters are bunged in at the end for no apparent reason,\
  \ shedding unpitying light on old favourites like Lars Talc as well as introducing\
  \ some brand new gits, including Eileen Hollyhock and the Brothers Hellbag. Fully\
  \ illustrated with four black & white plates by the author. A splash of colour is\
  \ added by the insertion of a sheet of wallpaper in all fifty copies of this first\
  \ edition, numbered and signed and all the usual shenanigans\u2026\nHouse Of Turps\
  \ (in preparation)\n  The first volume in a projected series of 26 books in which\
  \ the full and uproarious history of the House of Turps is dissected with a blunt\
  \ pen-knife. This initial book potters about in the pre-history of the House, examining\
  \ the events leading to its foundation, in particular the role played by a large\
  \ number of inanimate objects including hammers, iron pots, wrestling-rings, and\
  \ bandage paste. Future volumes in the series will lay bare the complete history\
  \ of this remarkable institution, the whole adding up to what can only be described\
  \ as a Bath of Learning, a Broth of Truth. Deceptively simple, even rambling, the\
  \ construction of this first book is awesomely complicated, its intricate machinery\
  \ a triumph of meldrum and binge. Illustrated by the author, as usual. Signed &\
  \ numbered, as usual. Silk-screened cover, for once.\nNOTE\_: That last blurb was\
  \ written before I actually wrote House Of Turps. It remains the only one of the\
  \ planned series of twenty-six ever to see the light of day. The cover was not silk-screened.\n\
