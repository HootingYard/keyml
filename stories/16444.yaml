text: "The only sound to tear the night comes from the man upstairs. His bloated belching\
  \ figure stomps. He may crash through the ceiling soon. If he does so, the sound\
  \ will cease. He will be lying on his back, on my carpet, covered in a film of dust\
  \ and powder and debris. I will cast upon him a look of reproach, and poke him with\
  \ the pointy stick I keep to hand for circumstances such as these. He may grunt,\
  \ if still alive, or not, if dead.\nWhen I prod his neck, I will dislodge from around\
  \ it a delicate silver chain to which is attached a medallion. It bears a depiction\
  \ of a saint, identified by an inscription as Saint Agur. I will be tempted to kick\
  \ the bloated belcher in the head, on account of his stupidity. Is he not aware\
  \ that this so-called saint is but a figment of the marketing department of a French\
  \ cheesemaking concern? Not for the first time, I will be driven crackers by the\
  \ blithering ignorance of my neighbours. As Dylan observed, it's a wonder that they\
  \ still know how to breathe.\nThe belcher from upstairs splayed on my carpet may\
  \ or may not be breathing. But the sound of his stomping, mercifully done with,\
  \ will now be replaced by the roaring of an idiot wind. Wild is the wind, and I\
  \ hear the sound of mandolins. Can a man get no peace nor quiet in this damnable\
  \ urbis? I will retreat to my kitchen for Phensic and marmalade. Somewhere I have\
  \ a packet of twenty No. 6, but no light. I will rifle through the pockets of the\
  \ bloated git on my carpet. I will give him a kicking as I do so.\nBut he is not\
  \ there. He did not, after all, crash through the ceiling. The stomping of his bloated\
  \ belching figure remains the only sound. Until, at last, day breaks, and it is\
  \ joined by twittering birdsong, and the clink and clank of the milkman on his morning\
  \ rounds.\nMilkman, milkman, bring me curds and whey!\nNo\u2014there is nothing\
  \ for you today.\nNo milk, no whey, no curds nor cream.\nGo crash through the ceiling\
  \ of your dream.\nReferences\_: S. Engel, B. Dylan. N. Washington, P. Strohmeyer-Gartside\n\
