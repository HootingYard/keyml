text: "Dobson was no stranger to controversy, but rarely did he create so tumultuous\
  \ a brouhaha as was caused by his pamphlet Hints And Tips For Intrepid Explorers\
  \ In The Polar Wastes (out of print). Dobson himself had of course never been anywhere\
  \ near either the Arctic or the Antarctic, and one of the many puzzles he left behind\
  \ for the unwary biographer is the question of why he ever thought he was qualified\
  \ to address the subject. He was only too ready to admit to his ignorance of certain\
  \ matters, made plain in pamphlets such as My Blithering Ignorance Of Vast Swathes\
  \ Of Ornithology and When It Comes To Ice Hockey, I Have No Idea What I Am Talking\
  \ About, both of which are tragically out of print.\nYet he felt able to compile\
  \ a list of hints and tips for polar exploration, and ensured that Marigold Chew\
  \ ran off more copies on the Gestetner machine in the potting shed than she did\
  \ of almost any other pamphlet he ever wrote. Indeed, a number of their breakfasts\
  \ were ruined during a period in the 1950s when the pamphleteer insisted that his\
  \ inamorata gobble down her kedgeree in double quick time so she could hurry off\
  \ to the shed to crank out another dozen copies. Oddly, he does seem to have actually\
  \ had some success in selling them, though this may have been due to the breathtakingly\
  \ gorgeous mezzotint of a polar bear, by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint, which\
  \ was used on the cover. There was a sort of polar bear fad at the time, occasioned\
  \ by the popular radio serial The Adventures Of Martin The Polar Bear, starring\
  \ Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert. The historian and cultural commentator Bevis\
  \ Sebag has suggested, compellingly, that most of the people who bought Dobson's\
  \ pamphlet tore off the cover, placed the mezzotint in a frame and hung it on the\
  \ wall of their parlour, and chucked the pamphlet itself into the bin.\nBut some\
  \ people obviously did read it, otherwise there would not have been a tumultuous\
  \ brouhaha. And a tumultuous brouhaha there was, with knobs on! Several very foolish\
  \ explorers went off to the Arctic or the Antarctic clutching copies of Dobson's\
  \ pamphlet, to the exclusion of any other written guidance whatsoever. It is fair\
  \ to say that their lives were in his hands. Because his \u201Chints and tips\u201D\
  \ were almost entirely spurious, idiotic, irrelevant, wrong-headed, fantastical,\
  \ and outright dangerous, not one of these several fools ever returned alive from\
  \ the polar wastes. Hence the tumultuous brouhaha, when their grieving relicts and\
  \ orphans blamed the pamphleteer and tried to have him prosecuted in a court of\
  \ law.\nThere were a few weeks during which Dobson had to face noisy marches and\
  \ demonstrations, a temporary encampment of earnest young persons in tents outside\
  \ his house, and some unkind newspaper headlines, including OUT OF PRINT PAMPHLETEER\
  \ SENT EXPLORERS TO CERTAIN DEATH, BEREAVED TOT SHAMES PAMPHLETEER WITH HEART-RENDING\
  \ MESSAGE SCRIBBLED WITH CRAYONS ON PLACARD, and ANTARCTIC WIDOWS\u2019 ICE CUBE\
  \ PROTEST SCUPPERED BY UNEXPECTEDLY BALMY WEATHER SPELL. (Note for younger readers\_\
  : newspapers in those days were printed on much bigger sheets of paper, and had\
  \ more words than pictures.) But eventually all the fuss died down, as it usually\
  \ does. The marches and demonstrations were broken up by charging police horses,\
  \ the futility of their tentage gradually dawned on the young persons, and the newspapers\
  \ moved on to other stories, such as VICE PRESIDENT NIXON ATTACKED BY ANGRY MOB\
  \ IN VENEZUELA and LISTENERS REACT WITH FURY AS \u2018THE ADVENTURES OF MARTIN THE\
  \ POLAR BEAR\u2019 IS CANCELLED BY OUT OF TOUCH RADIO BOSSES\u2014COURTNEIDGE \u2018\
  LIVID\u2019 SAY PALS.\nThroughout the tumultuous brouhaha, Dobson himself remained\
  \ silent. Partly, or indeed wholly, this may have been because his position was\
  \ indefensible. This was a pamphleteer, remember, whose sole advice, on the subject\
  \ of unimaginably harsh gale-swept subzero temperatures in the frozen hell of the\
  \ polar wastes was \u201CBest pack a woolly\u201D.\nIn a new monograph, the reputed\
  \ Dobson scholar and polar explorer Loopy Pangloss has been through the pamphlet\
  \ with a fine toothed comb. In her foreword, she admits that it is inconceivable\
  \ to her that such a titanic figure as Dobson could have written a pamphlet entirely\
  \ devoid of sense. Her task, she says, is to winnow from it something, anything,\
  \ that could in some way restore the pamphleteer's reputation among the polar exploration\
  \ community. Triumphantly, she alights upon Tip Number 12, reproduced here in full:\n\
  You might, in the unimaginably harsh gale-swept subzero temperatures in the frozen\
  \ hell of the polar wastes, become peckish. If so, wrap up warm and plod out into\
  \ the ice and snow until you see a polar bear. These are big fierce creatures, but\
  \ using skill, judgement, and weaponry, you should be able to kill one. That done,\
  \ drag the slaughtered polar bear back to your nice warm hut. Using an axe, chop\
  \ it to pieces, each piece being no bigger than a baby's clenched fist. Sort the\
  \ chunks out by type, i.e., fur, bone, sinew, fat, flesh, innards, what have you.\
  \ Select the chunks that look toothsome, and place them in a large pot. Fill the\
  \ pot with water, and bring to the boil. Place a lid on the pot and let it simmer\
  \ for hours. Top up the water from time to time. While it is cooking, feed the unselected\
  \ less toothsome chunks of polar bear, raw, to the huskies. Anything they leave\
  \ can be put into a blender and liquidised. Heat this in a pan until it is the consistency\
  \ of mayonnaise. Transfer the decisively-boiled polar bear chunks from the pot to\
  \ a plate, pour over the liquid from the pan as a sauce, and tuck in.\nImportant\
  \ note\_: however toothsome it appears, on no account should you eat the polar bear's\
  \ liver. It is highly toxic, containing a terrifyingly high concentration of retinol,\
  \ the form of vitamin A found in members of the animal kingdom. If eaten in one\
  \ meal, 30 to 90 grams of polar bear liver is enough to kill a human being, or to\
  \ make even sled dogs very ill. Believe you me, you will not want to come down with\
  \ a case of acute hypervitaminosis A. The symptoms include drowsiness, sluggishness,\
  \ irritability, severe headache, bone pain, blurred vision, vomiting, peeling skin,\
  \ flaking around the mouth, full-body skin loss, liver damage, haemorrhage, coma\
  \ and death.\nAs Ms Pangloss points out, this is true. \u201CFor all its faults,\u201D\
  \ she concludes, \u201CDobson's Hints And Tips For Intrepid Explorers In The Polar\
  \ Wastes (out of print) is not wholly worthless. We should give him credit for that.\u201D\
  \nSo we do.\n\nA polar bear\_: do not eat its liver\n[2012-04-04]"
