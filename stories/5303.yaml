text: "We enter the second half of our alphabet with N, which could have been for\
  \ Nebuchadnezzar, had we not dealt with that king's wild manias under M for Mead\
  \ and Medica Sacra. That being so, N is for Nothing.\n\u201COh what horror to bite\
  \ on nothing\u201D, sang Peter Blegvad, once upon a time. Nothing ventured, nothing\
  \ gained. Our next letter, O, could be taken for Nothing, too, if it were to be\
  \ misread as 0, or zero, which it can be, if you are not looking carefully and don't\
  \ give a damn about context. Iggy Pop claims that his band, The Stooges, has the\
  \ best band-name ever, simply because of that \u201Coo\u201D in the middle. But\
  \ the \u201Coo\u201D sound, written down, can also be interpreted as a double-zero,\
  \ a double nothingness, as in, for example, the surname of the poet Rupert Brooke,\
  \ propelled into the nothingness of death by a gnat-bite to his lip, as he sailed\
  \ towards the Dardanelles, and Gallipoli. Edgar Allan Poe has just the one O at\
  \ the centre of his surname, the O of a maelstrom, such as the maelstrom that lies\
  \ in wait for Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as he vanishes into a white nothingness.\
  \ Iggy, too, has a central O in his surname, coupled by the O of his real surname,\
  \ Osterburg.\nBut I ought not be babbling about all these Os now, when we are speaking\
  \ of N, when we are speaking of Nothing.\n[2010-09-26]"
