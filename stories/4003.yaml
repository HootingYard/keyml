text: "One of the most common difficulties facing newcomers to the teachings of Trebizondo\
  \ Culpeper is the complete absence, anywhere, of boogie, coupled with the almost\
  \ terrifying prevalence, throughout, of woogie.\nIn his magisterial if incoherent\
  \ Syncretic Glossary Of The \u201CWay\u201D Of Trebizondo Culpeper, J K Pox devotes\
  \ some three hundred pages to what he calls \u201Cthe boogie-woogie conundrum\u201D\
  . One can argue that there is no conundrum, but that doesn't stop Pox harping on\
  \ about it. As ever, he is flamboyant, and one must admire his refusal to define\
  \ his terms, as if in doing so the magic, if magic it is, would leach out of them.\n\
  \u201CWhen thunder claps and wolves howl,\u201D he writes, \u201CWhen the sedge\
  \ is wither'd on the lake, and gigantic mutant crustaceans come a-clattering on\
  \ to the sandbanks, then, then! my sweet dear ones, is when we are most tempted\
  \ to admit into our souls some sort of boogie. Squash the very thought underfoot,\
  \ as one might a fig during a fig-glut. No, there is not and never has been and\
  \ never will be boogie, if we follow the Way with eyes bright and brows clean. There\
  \ is only woogie, blessed, blossoming and blanketing, at once tough as nails and\
  \ chewy as the king and queen of toffees. So we are taught by Trebizondo Culpeper\
  \ and so we have embroidered upon our pullovers. Link arms and sing, as snow falls\
  \ and tinkly things tinkle. Sing!\u201D\nPox does not go on to say what song it\
  \ is his readers and students should be singing. To do so may have been psychologically\
  \ impossible for him, for as we know he was, when young, expelled from the Conservatoire\
  \ before his studies had properly begun, following the incident described in pages\
  \ 45 to 64 of Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Gummed-Up Tuba And The Worm-Eaten\
  \ Spinet.\n[2010-02-28]"
