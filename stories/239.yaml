text: "Today I learned, O Waly, Waly, that Benjamin Britten (1913\u20131976) was the\
  \ child of a dentist. Britten celebrated his fiftieth birthday on the same day that\
  \ both Aldous Huxley and C S Lewis died, which\u2014as all students of such matters\
  \ are vibrantly aware\u2014was the date of the assassination of President John F\
  \ Kennedy. Incidentally, not long before his death, the spookily tall and almost\
  \ blind Huxley answered the doorbell of his California home to a young vacuum cleaner\
  \ salesman named Don Van Vliet, soon to be better known as Captain Beefheart. It\
  \ would be fitting if I could end this squib with the observation that Van Vliet,\
  \ too, was the child of a dentist, but his Pa was a van driver for a bakery, toting\
  \ pastry-related items hither and yon, and I have no idea of his Ma's occupation,\
  \ alas.\n[2007-09-10]"
