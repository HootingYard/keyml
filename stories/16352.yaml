text: "There is a bulging postbag here at Hooting Yard, and today nearly all the letters\
  \ contained therein are asking the same question. Is there any relation between\
  \ Billy Two Hats, the dual-headed cowboy we met on Wednesday last, and Billy Whizz,\
  \ the high-speed cartoon character whose capers were chronicled in The Beano?\n\n\
  Conscientious as ever, I have looked into this matter on your behalf, and I can\
  \ now present my findings.\nThere are important differences between the two characters.\
  \ Being a cowboy, Billy Two Hats is, to a large extent, horsebound, whereas Billy\
  \ Whizz is not. He whizzes about on his legs, though so rapidly does he make his\
  \ progress through the streets and alleys and boulevards of Whizztown that those\
  \ legs are sometimes rendered barely visible. Nonetheless, it is clear that he is\
  \ not sitting astride a horse. Also, in all known portraits, Billy Whizz's neck\
  \ supports just a single head, never two.\nOn the other hand, they have several\
  \ things in common, quite apart from being Billys. To give one example, neither\
  \ of them is ever transformed, temporarily or permanently, after an encounter with\
  \ a wand-waving wizard at dusk by the edge of an eerie marsh, into a magic chicken.\
  \ Or, to be piercingly accurate, there is at least no surviving record of such a\
  \ poultry transformation, or \u201Cpoultformation\u201D as it is termed in the literature.\
  \ Believe me, I have scoured the records and come up with nothing.\nOne of the letters\
  \ in the postbag asks, \u201CCan you be quite sure, Mr Key, to the umpteenth degree\
  \ of certainty, that neither Two Hats nor Whizz, on horseback or at high speed,\
  \ was aboard the airship LZ 129 Hindenburg when it burst into flames during its\
  \ attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst in Manchester\
  \ Township, New Jersey, on 6 May 1937?\u201D To which I must confess that no, I\
  \ cannot be one hundred percent certain, because I have not studied, in detail,\
  \ the passenger manifest. I will say, however, that I think it most unlikely.\n\
  This is merely a summary of my findings. For the full report, bulked out with footnotes,\
  \ illustrations, diagrams, appendices, and a bit of sandpaper, send ten shillings\
  \ and sixpence to me at the usual address. Mark your envelope with an unseemly stain\
  \ roughly the same shape as a map of Uruguay, or any other South American country\
  \ of your choosing, or any other country in one of the other continents, a list\
  \ of which can be obtained by sending me even more money in the form of non-transferable\
  \ gilt bonds drawn on an important international bank.\n[2018-03-17]"
