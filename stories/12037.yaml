  You lot need to replace your copies of Dracula by Bram Stoker, and you need to do
  so right now. Well, actually, make that on Thursday, when the new paperback edition
  pictured above is published. The reason you need to do so is because this edition
  is illustrated by my second-born son, Edwood Burn. It is his first publication,
  released as he begins the final year of his illustration degree, so it seems to
  me you ought to go and buy it out of your devoted loyalty to Hooting Yard.
