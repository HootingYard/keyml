  \ fifty-five,\u201D who did not merely drive a gig and graduate in respectability\
  \ in such a middle-class way, but was an honoured guest in the saloons of exiled\
  \ princes, and having easy access to the tables of the noblest of our countrymen,\
  \ he appeared to live upon a social eminence which might have provoked jealousy,\
  \ but which freed him from any suspicion of heinous criminality. On the other hand\
  \ he has been represented, with perhaps equal exaggeration, to have been certainly\
  \ a parvenu, and perhaps a bore. He is said to have been the son of a glove-maker,\
  \ and to have had, in his own person, some mysterious commercial connection with\
  \ button-making, and to have either acquired his title by the purchase of a small\
  \ Italian estate which conferred that empty distinction upon him, or else to have\
  \ been the last plebeian metamorphosed into an aristocrat by the will and pleasure\
  \ of the late Louis Philippe. It is doubtless, as a matter of gossip, interesting\
  \ to that curious individual, the general reader\u2014but it is a matter of perfect\
  \ indifference in an English court of law whether the accused is the undoubted scion\
  \ of a family dating from the Deluge, or the most pushing, irrepressible, and objectionable\
