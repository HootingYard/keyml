  \ paperback is almost ready, I really ought to buckle down to important Hooting\
  \ Yardery again. One thing I have been doing while ignoring you lot is continuing\
  \ my intermittent reading\u2014begun last December\u2014of Vincent Bugliosi's magisterial\
  \ Reclaiming History. This, you may recall, is a preposterously huge tome\u2014\
  1,518 pages of dense text\u2014devoted to the Kennedy assassination.\nTwo phrases\
  \ are particularly evocative for hopeless JFK obsessives like me\u2014the grassy\
  \ knoll and the picket fence. So magisterial is Bugliosi's magisterial book that\
  \ he even finds space, in a footnote, for a minor though shocking revelation. The\
  \ fence in Dealey Plaza commonly referred to as the picket fence is not a picket\
  \ fence at all! Dogged in his pursuit of absolutely everything anybody could ever\
  \ possibly care to know about the events of that day in Dallas, Bugliosi conducted\
  \ an interview by telephone on 18 August 2005 with Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth\
  \ Floor Museum. Mr Mack told him: \u201CIn a picket fence, the wooden slats are\
  \ not touching each other across the width of the fence. Here, they are. The fence\
  \ is more properly referred to as a stockade fence.\u201D\nI had to go for a long\
  \ walk to clear my head after reading that. I can only hope it has cleared sufficiently\
  \ for me to resume bashing out the prose you lot have come to rely upon to keep\
  \ you sane in a doolally universe.\n\nThe picket fence\u2014not a picket fence\n\
