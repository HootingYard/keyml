text: "One man who knew a thing or two about boiling My Lady Kent's pudding, apart\
  \ from Sylvester Patridge, was Blodgett. Blodgett first came upon the recipe when\
  \ he was under the culinary tutelage of the so-called Culinary King of Cuxhaven,\
  \ Binsey Poplars. Poplars himself unearthed the pudding details during his researches\
  \ in an archive of pudding recipes at the Texas Recipe Book Depository in Dallas,\
  \ bang next door to the more famous\u2014or infamous\u2014Texas Schoolbook Depository,\
  \ from a sixth floor window of which, on a November day in 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald\
  \ shot President John Fitzgerald Kennedy with a mail-order Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.\
  \ Some would add \u201Callegedly\u201D after that statement, but not me. I have\
  \ read my Posner.\nNobody, so far as we know, ever shot anyone from a window of\
  \ the Recipe Book Depository, not even Binsey Poplars, who, when he was not rummaging\
  \ through old recipe books, could himself be impelled to acts of senseless violence.\
  \ He once broke Blodgett's legs, for example, quite deliberately, with blows from\
  \ a tent peg mallet. Poplars called this mallet his Hammer of Pedagogy, which was\
  \ something of a misnomer, as he also used it to crack eggs, to bash out dents in\
  \ his pans, and to hammer tent pegs into campsite mud. He was fond of taking his\
  \ students on camping trips to the outskirts of Cuxhaven, and having them forage\
  \ or starve.\nIt was on one such escapade, when Blodgett was still on crutches,\
  \ that teacher and student fell into a lengthy conversation about puddings. The\
  \ Culinary King had only recently returned from his Texas trip, and his head was\
  \ full of the recipes he had discovered in the pudding archive. The countryside\
  \ around Cuxhaven was at the mercy of roaring winds that weekend, and Poplars and\
  \ his students were huddled in their tents. It was not foraging weather. The pedagogue\
  \ made a point of sharing his tent with any student whose bones he had broken in\
  \ a fit of temper, and so it was Blodgett on this occasion who sprawled at his master's\
  \ feet. As far as puddings went, Blodgett knew almost as much as Binsey Poplars.\
  \ He had immersed himself in the world of puddings since infancy, and it was this\
  \ enthusiasm that had led him to sign up to the Culinary King's Crash Course in\
  \ the first place. For though Blodgett could tell you about thousands of different\
  \ puddings, he had no idea how to make a single one of them.\nIn the tent, as gales\
  \ howled and canvas flapped, Poplars and Blodgett talked about puddings for hours.\n\
  \u201COf course,\u201D said Binsey Poplars pompously, \u201CSylvester Patridge claimed\
  \ to know the correct boiling time for My Lady Kent's pudding, but the man was a\
  \ charlatan and a fool, and if you boiled it for the time he recommended you would\
  \ end up with a pretty sorry excuse for a pudding\u201D.\n\u201CTell me more,\u201D\
  \ said Blodgett, all ears, because here was a pudding that, remarkably, he had never\
  \ heard of. And as his tutor prattled on, Blodgett scraped shorthand notes on to\
  \ one of his crutches with a sharpened twig.\nYears later, far from Cuxhaven, restored\
  \ in limb, and now a dab hand at cooking the puddings he had once merely salivated\
  \ over, Blodgett stumbled upon his old crutch and deciphered the scrapings he had\
  \ made upon it. He transcribed them into a notebook, embellished them, and published\
  \ them as part of Blodgett's Book Of Many Puddings, a copy of which, fittingly,\
  \ was acquired by the trustees of the pudding archive at the Texas Recipe Book Depository\
  \ on Elm Street in Dallas, just along from the overpass on the Stemmons Freeway.\n\
  A fantastic challenge for any maker of boiled puddings, he wrote, is the pudding\
  \ named after My Lady Kent. Should it be steamed before boiling, or afterwards?\
  \ Should it indeed be steamed at all, or should one just get on and boil it? What\
  \ is the best type of pan in which to chuck the pudding ingredients prior to boiling?\
  \ Does the pan matter? If the pan is dented, should one bash out the dents with\
  \ the Hammer of Pedagogy beforehand? If one neglects to do so, will any indentations\
  \ in the finished pudding caused by the dents add to its savour, or will they detract\
  \ from it? Is there a place, in the contemporary world, for dented puddings, or\
  \ should we be aiming for clean lines and smooth edges? Can a modern version of\
  \ My Lady Kent's pudding compete with the original? Should we allow indentations\
  \ irrespective of their effect simply because, in all likelihood, given the rough\
  \ and tumble of the times, My Lady Kent's own pans would have been outrageously\
  \ dented? Rare was the pan in those days that did not get bashed about and suffer\
  \ because of that bashing. That may be one reason for the popularity of puddings,\
  \ for there are cogent arguments claiming that the final shape of a pudding, particularly\
  \ a boiled pudding, matters not a jot to the eater of the pudding. Are there any\
  \ cases we can advert to where a pudding has been sent back from table with the\
  \ complaint \u201CI cannot eat this pudding. It is dented.\u201D? Such reservations\
  \ are likely with other things one might eat. A duck of the wrong shape, likewise\
  \ a pig's head or a pie full of misshapen blackbirds, will cause revulsion, for\
  \ the eater may think, rightly, that they are being fobbed off with abominations\
  \ of nature. But there is no such thing as the correct shape of a pudding, not even\
  \ of My Lady Kent's pudding. And yet to make one that is succulent and lip-smacking\
  \ remains a challenge, and takes years of study, sometimes in a tent, on the outskirts\
  \ of Cuxhaven, while canvas is buffeted and fierce winds blow.\nIt does not escape\
  \ the reader's notice that Blodgett fails to answer many of the questions he\u2014\
  or Binsey Poplars before him\u2014raises, and nor does he provide a workable recipe\
  \ for the pudding he so enthuses about. That is Blodgett all over, of course, infuriating\
  \ and exasperating yet strangely adorable for all that.\nIncidentally, it is said\
  \ that the dressmaker Abraham Zapruder, who filmed the famous footage of the Kennedy\
  \ assassination on his top-of-the-range Model 414 PD 8 mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic\
  \ Director Series movie camera, was planning to spend the afternoon, following the\
  \ passing of the presidential motorcade, in the Texas Recipe Book Depository, specifically\
  \ to consult Blodgett's book. Whether he was intending to boil My Lady Kent's pudding,\
  \ and was looking for helpful hints, we do not know, and now we never will, for\
  \ history took a fateful turn on that sunny day in Dallas, and the dressmaker's\
  \ boiled pudding thoughts were wiped clean from his brain. But not from yours, or\
  \ mine.\n[2009-02-21]"
