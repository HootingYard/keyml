  \ He is two and a half, and will be playing one of the Three Wise Men in his nursery\
  \ nativity play. The part calls for him to deliver the line \u201CI have myrrh\u201D\
  .\nHe has been rehearsing with admirable diligence. It is, I think, a credit to\
  \ his acting skills that, while one rarely, if ever, encounters myrrh in 21st century\
  \ Britain, he gives a compelling performance and one truly believes that, yes, this\
  \ small child does indeed have myrrh. And he has been able to inhabit fully the\
  \ character of the Wise Man without having to ask the director \u201Cwhat's my motivation?\u201D\
  . He comes to it naturally.\nAs Sir Laurence Olivier said to Dustin Hoffman on the\
  \ set of Marathon Man, when the latter expressed surprise that Olivier did not employ\
  \ \u201Cthe Method\u201D, \u201CIt's called acting, dear boy\u201D.\n[2015-12-05]"
