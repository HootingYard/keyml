text: "Easter Sunday is the most important day in the Christian calendar, the day\
  \ when we celebrate the ineffable mystery of the resurrection. In this godless age,\
  \ some of you may have no idea what I am talking about. I refer you to the 1974\
  \ hit single by Mott The Hoople, Roll Away The Stone, which in turn refers to the\
  \ scene in the Gospel of Matthew 28\_: 1\u20136,\nIn the end of the sabbath, as\
  \ it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the\
  \ other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for\
  \ the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone\
  \ from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment\
  \ white as snow: And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.\
  \ And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye\
  \ seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.\
  \ Come, see the place where the Lord lay.\nand the Gospel of Mark 16\_: 1\u2013\
  4,\nAnd when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James,\
  \ and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And\
  \ very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre\
  \ at the rising of the sun. And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away\
  \ the stone from the door of the sepulchre? And when they looked, they saw that\
  \ the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.\nThe evangelists Luke and John\
  \ cover the same material, but you get the idea, I hope.\n\nFor many years now,\
  \ my own way of celebrating Easter has been to bathe in the blood of the lamb. During\
  \ the rest of the year, I bathe as normal, in hot water, perhaps with an admixture\
  \ of bubble bath, but on Easter Sunday I like to make a special effort in honour\
  \ of He who is risen. From time to time I have been asked to provide a set of instructions\
  \ so that others may do as I do. This is not surprising, as I know many of you seek\
  \ to live your lives as closely as possible according to the tenets of Hooting Yard.\
  \ To date, I have kept my Easter light under an Easter bushel, but recently I found\
  \ my arm twisted, as if I were Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon,\
  \ until I agreed to explain exactly what you need to do.\nFirst of all, load up\
  \ your cart with empty buckets and an axe, the blade of which should have been sharpened,\
  \ lethally, on your whetstone. Get dressed in a big black cape, or alternately in\
  \ a winding-sheet, the better to suggest an angel of death, and set your features\
  \ in an awful rictus of terror. Then set out for a nearby field where sheep and\
  \ their lambs are likely to be gambolling. If you have a yapping dog that could\
  \ be useful in rounding up lambs and running in circles around them, so they are\
  \ too frightened to escape, take it with you. It can either ride on the cart along\
  \ with the buckets and the axe, or, if it is a particularly frisky yapping dog,\
  \ let it trot beside you.\nWhen you reach the field, take your axe and run screaming\
  \ at a lamb. Smite it. A cursory knowledge of lamb anatomy can come in useful at\
  \ this point, for you should if possible try to sever an artery with the first smiting.\
  \ Then pick up the lamb by a hind leg, hold it over one of the buckets, and squeeze\
  \ as much of its blood out of it as you can. When you are done, toss the drained\
  \ corpse of the lamb to one side, run screaming at another lamb, and repeat the\
  \ process. You should continue until all your buckets are brimful of blood.\nIf\
  \ you are a namby-pamby do-gooder who blubs at the sight of, say, a baby sparrow\
  \ with a broken wing, or a weeping doe-eyed orphan, you might want to hire a ruffian\
  \ from the local tavern to do the slaughtering and blood-draining for you. I cannot\
  \ say I recommend this method, however, as tavern ruffians are not the most trustworthy\
  \ of men, and you will have no guarantee that the buckets he delivers to your door\
  \ are filled with the blood of lambs. Give a ruffian an axe and he will probably\
  \ just go and slaughter the first things he sees, which might include your yapping\
  \ dog, a defenceless widow-woman, or indeed you.\nWhen your buckets are full, trundle\
  \ the cart home, and clean the blade of your axe with swarfega and borax. You can\
  \ then take the buckets up to the bathroom. Remembering first to put the plug in\
  \ the bath, tip the blood from each bucket into the tub. Take off your cape or winding-sheet\
  \ and whatever else you are wearing, and climb into the bath. Lie back, relax, and\
  \ hum a hymn. I usually go for The Old Rugged Cross. If you do not know any hymns,\
  \ that Mott The Hoople hit is a good substitute.\nIt may be that you live in an\
  \ area bereft of lambs, perhaps in some sea-girt hellhole where turtles are rife.\
  \ I have not been able to ascertain any specific Christian connotations relating\
  \ to the blood of turtles, but the ancient Romans used it for both shampoo and toothpaste\
  \ and, mixed with human milk, as a cure for earache. The ancient Romans, of course,\
  \ were pagans, and lived in benighted ignorance of Christ, so do bear that in mind\
  \ as you, or your hired ruffian, stalk down to the beach bent on slaughter.\nNOTA\
  \ BENE\_: I am not sure I have my Peter Lorre reference right. It may be that he\
  \ pleads \u201CStop twisting my arm!\u201D in a different film\u2014Casablanca?\
  \ Chapter and verse from a film buff reader would be appreciated.\n[2012-04-08]"
