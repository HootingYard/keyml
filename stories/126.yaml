text: "From Much Depends On Dinner\_: The Extraordinary History And Mythology, Allure\
  \ And Obsessions, Perils And Taboos, Of An Ordinary Meal by Margaret Visser:\nAt\
  \ the end of the seventeenth century, John Evelyn wrote a book on salads, called\
  \ Aceteria (things in vinegared dressing): A Discourse of Sallets, in which he extols\
  \ the reign of lettuce over the salad bowl. \u201CAnd certainly \u2018tis not for\
  \ nothing,\u201D he wrote, \u201Cthat our Garden-Lovers, and Brothers of the Sallet,\
  \ have been so exceedingly Industrious to cultivate this Noble Plant, and multiply\
  \ its Species; for\u2026 by reason of its soporiferous quality, lettuce ever was,\
  \ and still continues the principal foundation of the universal tribe of Sallets,\
  \ which is to cool and refresh, besides its other properties,\u201D which include\
  \ inducements to \u201Cmorals, temperance, and chastity.\u201D\n[2007-03-17]"
