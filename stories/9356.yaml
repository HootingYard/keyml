text: "What, when there are places on the map called Upper Dicker, Lower Dicker, or\
  \ Wyre Piddle, was the particular appeal of Deal (pop. 28,504), one wonders, for\
  \ the nation's reprobates and misanthropes? The drunken polymorphously perverse\
  \ bankrupt novelist and cashiered King's Own Shropshire Light Infantryman Simon\
  \ Raven (1927\u20132001), for example, was banished to a nursing home for handicapped\
  \ old ladies in the town for thirty-four years, sallying forth every now and again\
  \ to a massage parlour opposite the Reform Club, Pall Mall, for \u2018a good housemaid's\
  \ wank\u2019. One is compelled to picture the streets of Deal as a world in decay\
  \ thronged with George Grosz characters got up in askew velvet hats and musquash\
  \ coats seeking eyeglass-fogging diversions. \u2018I always used to see [Charles]\
  \ Hawtrey being pulled out of pubs,\u2019 Raven recalled the week before he died,\
  \ \u2018But what's wrong with that? We all like a drink, don't we dear?\u2019 Deal\
  \ is the capital of non-conformity.\nA footnote by Roger Lewis in his biography\
  \ Charles Hawtrey\_: The Man Who Was Private Widdle (2001). Another Deal resident,\
  \ in his final years, was Rayner Heppenstall (1911\u20131981), whose posthumously\
  \ published novel The Pier is a murderous fantasy in which the Heppenstall-like\
  \ narrator systematically plans and commits the slaughter of his (working class)\
  \ next door neighbours.\n\n[2012-06-03]"
