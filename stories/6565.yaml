text: "I am a grandee\nI have a long beard\nAnd I wear a big hat made of fur\nI sit\
  \ in a tree\nAnd things become weird\nWhen the cogs in my brain start to whirr\n\
  Birds fall from the sky\nLakes boil to steam\nHens and chickens come home to roost\n\
  Oh do not ask why\nIt is not a dream\nBut the tethers of sense are unloos'd\nThe\
  \ tree is a pine\nI perch on a bough\nMy grandeur will dazzle your sight\n\u201C\
  O give us a sign!\nAnd give it us now!\u201D\nYou caterwaul with all your might\n\
  But I just sit\nAnd gesticulate\nAnd summon up thunder and storm\n\u2018Cos I am\
  \ a git\nDeciding your fate\nYou'll wish you had never been born\n[2011-05-02]"
