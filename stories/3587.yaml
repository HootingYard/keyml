text: "I thought, today, I would repost that old favourite What Dobson Did On Boxing\
  \ Day and have done with it. But another matter has barged in on my attention, and\
  \ must be addressed. Here is a letter received from moany reader Tim Thurn. It begins\
  \ pleasantly enough:\nDear Mr Key. Thank you so much for sending me Christmas greetings\
  \ in the form of a black and white photograph of some old bells. If I am not mistaken,\
  \ they look very much like the bells removed from the tower of St Wulfram\u2018\
  s church in Grantham, Lincolnshire, in 1946/47, and subsequently recast in Loughborough.\n\
  Tim then starts in on his complaint:\nThough I like the photograph very much, I\
  \ cannot say the same for the caption you have added to it. \u201CNever send to\
  \ ask for whom the jingle bell tolls; It tolls for thee\u201D is, of course, a doctored\
  \ quotation from John Donne's Meditation XVII, Nunc Lento Sonitu Dicunt, Morieris\
  \ from the Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions. You have inserted the word \u201C\
  jingle\u201D, presumably in a hare-brained attempt to lend a Christmassy air to\
  \ what is in fact a more sombre sentiment. That might be excused, or even chuckled\
  \ at, mildly, were you not doing violence to sheer sense. The point is, Mr Key,\
  \ while the bells shown may well have tolled, when in their tower, they would never\
  \ jingle, for they are not jingle bells. Even if we strip away the picture and consider\
  \ the caption in isolation, it remains nonsensical, for a jingle bell, by definition,\
  \ does not toll. It jingles. That is the point of it. A jingle bell is similar,\
  \ if not identical, to a sleigh bell, as deployed in legend by Santa and in fact\
  \ by the Russians, who for reasons of their own attached such bells to their sleighs\
  \ as they hurtled across the freezing desolate steppes, bent upon some mission authorised\
  \ by the Tsar, in the old days. Other inhabitants of cold climes, like Finns and\
  \ Lapps, would also go a-jingling \u2018cross the snowy wastes from time to time.\
  \ None of them, not the Russians nor the Finns nor the Lapps, would ever think to\
  \ weigh down their sleighs with a big, tolling bell, for to do so would be insane.\
  \ Might I suggest either that you amend your Christmas greeting or withdraw it entirely\
  \ and replace it with something less stupid?\nTim then provides a list of what he\
  \ considers suitable subjects, including robins, puddings, or a Victorian pater\
  \ familias placing a bauble upon a fir tree. He is, of course, quite right about\
  \ jingling and tolling, and I really ought to have thought more carefully before\
  \ messing about with the quotation from Dr Donne. But for crying out loud, Tim,\
  \ have you nothing better to do?\n[2009-12-26]"
