text: "Monday morning, time for a rant. Given that I persist in taking the Grauniad,\
  \ I suppose I have only myself to blame that while the day is yet young I was minded\
  \ to fling the paper across the room and utter execrations. What bothers me is that\
  \ their highly-paid columnists\u2014at least, paid a fat lot more than I am, i.e.\
  \ nothing\u2014betray such ignorance. It is the little details that vex me\u2026\
  \ those admittedly minor errors which, I sense, one only makes if lacking the broad\
  \ sweep of what used to be called \u201Cgeneral knowledge\u201D.\nToday's case in\
  \ point comes from fatuous television reviewer Sam Wollaston. Reviewing last night's\
  \ new Sherlock on the BBC, he notes that the modern-day setting of the series means\
  \ the characters get around by black cab rather than by \u201Cthe handsome carriage\u201D\
  . The what? He means the Hansom cab, of course. Anyone who knows that would not\
  \ mistype it as \u201Chandsome\u201D. The heavens will not fall in, the planets\
  \ will continue to spin, but yet this slapdashery pains me.\nA while ago, another\
  \ Grauniad television reviewer, addressing himself to a new adaptation of The Turn\
  \ Of The Screw, repeatedly referred to the story's presiding evil spirit as \u201C\
  Peter Clint\u201D, rather than \u201CQuint\u201D\u2014this in spite of the name\
  \ being clearly visible, at one point, upon a tombstone. Again, we are dealing here\
  \ with what I would consider general knowledge. Henry James\u2019 ghost story is\
  \ a classic, certainly a piece with which I would have thought anybody employed\
  \ in \u201Ccultural\u201D journalism would be familiar.\nTaking the cake, though,\
  \ is Grauniad America editor Michael Tomasky, who sets us a history quiz. The first\
  \ question is:\n1. Arguably the first great work of history in the Enlightenment\
  \ era was by Edward Gibbon and in six volumes described:\na. The Greco-Roman wars\n\
  b. The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\nc. The \u201CMohametan\u201D conquest\
  \ of Iberia\nIn the notes at the end of the quiz, he announces smugly \u201CIf you\
  \ didn't get this one, you should have stopped right then and there.\u201D It is\
  \ difficult to \u201Cget\u201D one where none of the three alternatives is correct.\
  \ Gibbon's great work was, of course, The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The\
  \ Roman Empire. No doubt I will be accused of nit-picking, but it seems to me this\
  \ is yet another example of blithe lack of attention to detail. And a narrative\
  \ of rise and fall would be a very different book to one limited to decline and\
  \ fall\u2014the phrase, itself, one which the literate instantly recognise.\nIncidentally,\
  \ if the Grauniad and the rest of the papers still employed a sufficient number\
  \ of subeditors, these embarrassments would be much less likely to occur. Bruce\
  \ Willis is a man who is rarely right about anything, and he was never more wrong\
  \ than when he wrote the immortal words \u201CProofreading is for pussies\u201D\
