text: 'The diary of a flapper, this day in 1922:

  Went out flapping, wearing my cloche hat, a straight loose dress, and unbuckled
  galoshes. Thrilled to the hot new jazz sounds at the Hot New Jazz Sounds Club, smoked
  lots of cigarettes, with a long cigarette holder, drank cocktails, and then drove
  an automobile at high speed through the city streets while laughing my head off.

  One day, far in the future, I will be a toothless crone, slumped in an armchair
  surrounded by knitting and cats. But even then I shall not buckle my galoshes, and
  I will always be able to look back and remember how I flapped, oh! how I flapped!
