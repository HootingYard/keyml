text: "May choirs of angels sing you to your rest. But before you nod off, or keel\
  \ over, try to take note how many among them are monopod angels. There will be angels\
  \ of monosodium, and caustic soda, and pure cobalt, but the monopods are quite rare,\
  \ and are not always welcome in angelic choirs. They have a tendency to screech.\
  \ This may be because their pods, or feet, are almost invariably those of birds,\
  \ such as the foot of a crow or an ostrich or a kittiwake. We do not like to think\
  \ of angels shunning other angels, but alas it is true.\nThe monopods are unpopular\
  \ for reasons other than their screeching in choir. It is thought that their hopping\
  \ is ungainly and lacks angelic grace, and that in some way they are letting the\
  \ side down. The obvious retort to this is that, as monopods, they have no other\
  \ means of unassisted locomotion than to hop from place to place. \u201CThen at\
  \ least hop with elegance!\u201D some mighty archangel might cry, dismissively.\n\
  More sympathetic angels, such as the majority of the monosodium ones, while nauseated\
  \ by the hopping, have suggested that the monopods could get about in carts, and\
  \ thus need hop not. The flaw in this angelic vision is that someone would have\
  \ to pull the cart, and no angel, not even one both monosodium and cobalt, would\
  \ demean themselves by doing so. The only angels likely to be keen to pull a monopod\
  \ in a cart would be other monopods, a fact which makes a nonsense of the whole\
  \ idea. Identical objections can be raised against the possibility of monopod angels\
  \ being pushed about in barrows.\nWhen in flight, monopod angels appear as graceful\
  \ as their biped colleagues, but of course no angel can remain in the air constantly,\
  \ with the exception of gossamer angels. Sooner or later the beating or fluttering\
  \ of its wings exhausts even the fittest angel, and it must descend from the boundless\
  \ firmament to rest on something solid, such as the branch of an oak tree in Peckham\
  \ Rye. This was the landing place of a 1767-vintage angel, spotted by William Blake\
  \ as he was out walking. It was not a monopod.\n\nIn this 1878 painting by William\
  \ Bouguereau, we see just how elegant a monopod angel can appear when in flight.\
  \ The lower, red-clad angel is the monopod, though unusually it does not have the\
  \ taloned foot of a bird.\n[2009-03-30]"
