  and here.]

  You will recall, I hope, the time when plucky tot Tiny Enid discovered the Waste
  Chute of History on the Large Flat Windy Uninhabited Plains. Well, to say she discovered
  it is something of a misnomer, for others had been there before her, not the least
  of whom was the very sensible Swiss researcher Erich Von Daniken (b. 1935).

  As we know, by the time Tiny Enid came upon the Chute, it extended, as Rossi would
  put it, down, down, deeper and down, to the very centre of the Earth. So intent
  was she upon her mission that the wee adventuress never bothered to wonder when
  and by whom the Chute was built. Yet these were precisely the questions that exercised
  Von Daniken''s fizzing brainbox. Considering the matter with his characteristic
  cast iron logic, he worked out that there must have been a time, during its construction,
  when the Chute was much shorter, and only went a little way into the bowels of the
  earth. Could it have been, he asked himself, staring out of the window at Swiss
  cows in Swiss fields under the shadow of looming Swiss Alps, that the original Chute
  was in fact designed to terminate only a few hundred feet below the surface, at
  the point where it punctured, perhaps, the roof of a subterranean cave?

  And if that were so, was it not the case that its purpose must therefore be not
  as a Waste Chute, but a Supply Chute? And whom else could it be intended to supply
  but a race of troglodyte beings inhabiting the subterranean cave, beings perhaps
  of extraterrestrial origin the velocity of whose spaceship, billions of years ago,
  had been so freakish that, when it crashed into our lovely planet, had simply kept
  going, boring through rock until eventually juddering to a halt in the cavernous
  underworld? Sipping his Swiss Schnapps, Von Daniken realised that his watertight
  theory actually accounted for the otherwise difficult problem of how the Chute had
  been built in the first place!

  He was about to turn from his chalet window and sit down at his typewriter to bash
  out a bestseller when a further point occurred to him. As the years passed, the
  troglodytes, breeding like extraterrestrial space-rabbits, would surely have outgrown
  their habitation. They must have burrowed their way into other subterranean caves,
  setting up new colonies. Then they would have faced the problem of how to supply
  every outpost of their underground empire. Rather than building new chutes, was
  it not obvious that the simplest way was to retain the original Chute, but to fit
  it with a series of pivots, so that it could be directionally adjusted to serve
  each cave as required?

  Clapping his Swiss hands with glee, Von Daniken was satisfied that his theory was
  utterly unassailable. In his mind''s eye, he could already see tottering piles of
  copies of his next bestseller, Chute-Pivots Of The Space Troglodytes?, eagerly snapped
  up not just by Swiss persons, but by his fans around the world.

  What happened next was a circumstance even Tiny Enid herself would have been powerless
  to avert. Just as Von Daniken was about to sit down and begin typing, there came
  a knocking at his chalet door. He opened it and came face to face with a person
  from Porlock. Yes, that person from Porlock!
